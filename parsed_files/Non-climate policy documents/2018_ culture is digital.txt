Foreword

Rt Hon. Matt Hancock

The UK’s future will be built at the nexus of our artistic and cultural creativity and 
our technical brilliance. The Centre for Economics and Business Research 2018 World 
Economic League Tables identify this particular blend of creativity and technology skills 
as the driving force behind the UK’s strong economic prospects over the long term1; a 
powerful combination of talents to project to the world as we prepare to leave the EU.

Digital technology is breaking down the silos between the cultural sectors2, blurring the 
lines between disciplines – theatre blends with film; computer programming merges 
with sculpture. We have virtual reality curatorship, animated artworks, video games 
scored by classical music composers.

Tech meets culture

Tech companies are collaborating with cultural organisations and practitioners to create 
new experiences for audiences, often exploring the boundaries of new technology at the 
same time. The Royal Shakespeare Company’s groundbreaking production of The Tempest 
brought digital avatars to life in real-time as part of a collaboration with Intel and 
Imaginarium. The partnership between English Heritage and Google Arts and Culture 
uses 360 degree image capture to reveal historical treasures online for the first time.

visual arts, heritage, museums, archives, libraries, film and making connections with the wider creative 
industries.

Culture is Digital 5

Unprecedented opportunities

Technology offers unprecedented opportunities for the UK cultural sector. On a 
daily basis we witness technology’s role in engaging new audiences, nationally and 
internationally, through digital platforms and distribution channels; in driving business 
models; creating art, cultural content and experiences; and increasing access to our 
world-class archives and collections. The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of 
Music sets the standard for music examinations in 93 countries. Its international 
reach and continued success is dependent on the use of digital tools to communicate 
with teachers and learners across the world. National Theatre Live is opening up 
performances to cinemas and classrooms all over the world whilst the Forever Project at 
the National Holocaust Centre and Museum near Newark, Nottinghamshire preserves 
the testimonies of Holocaust survivors using laser image technology.

The ultimate power couple 

The UK technology and cultural sectors make the ultimate power couple but more action 
is needed to make sure that they share the same interests. By focusing on the synergies 
between culture and technology – where the UK has dual competitive advantage – this 
Digital Culture Report focuses on the use of digital technology to drive our cultural 
sector’s global status and the engagement, diversity and well-being of audiences. 

This report is the culmination of the Digital Culture Project which I launched in April 
2017 with the #CultureisDigital online consultation. The enthusiastic response to 
#CultureisDigital animated this project’s consultation and policy making process. Our 
hashtag trended on twitter in week one, the online stakeholder discussion platform 
was viewed 39,000 times and the blogs on the project on our DCMS channels received 
thousands of views. As a result the stakeholder consultation attracted contributions 
from more than 150 organisations, from major national institutions to local arts 
charities, as well as large digital companies and tech start ups. Throughout the process, 
clear messages emerged about the opportunities and challenges and the demand 
from all parties for leadership, coordination and action3. We heard that a number of 
cultural organisations feel held back by a lack of infrastructure or resources, that they 
need better digital skills and to focus more time on leadership training; there are often 
communication barriers when working in a cross disciplinary way, and the pace of 
change in technology itself has resulted in a fragmented approach.

Audience expectations

We also heard a plea for evolution rather than upheaval. My department has 
responsibility for all things digital. But not everything is high tech. Or needs to be. 
We still enjoy reading a book, looking at a painting and watching a play without a 
mobile phone or a VR headset. Great art and cultural experiences are being created and 
appreciated by audiences in traditional formats. But audience expectations are changing 
and so are the practices of artists, creators and curators and we must ensure that the 
right structures are in place to support this transformation so that the UK continues its 
long history of creative excellence – digital and analogue. 

Cultural organisations have a powerful role to play for audiences – particularly younger 
audiences – in the digital age. In the echo chamber of social media where content and 
commentary can be chosen to confirm existing views, cultural organisations can provide 
challenge, interrogate our opinions, reveal our history and support our sense of community.

Over the following pages I aim to set out a vision for Digital Culture. I hope it shines a 
light on the considerable successes of culture’s engagement with technology and sets 
out some practical actions to help tackle the barriers for organisations of all sizes; tech 
and cultural.

Tech and culture partnerships

Through this report I want to encourage tech companies – large and small – to think 
about partnerships with cultural organisations. To help provide creative thinking, to 
scrutinise tech development or to connect to new audiences. The policy commitments 
are an Action Plan for cultural and tech organisations but they also provide a framework 
for the coordination and development of future activity. 

My enormous thanks go to the many individuals, organisations and advisors from 
across the cultural and tech sectors who have given freely of their experience, skills and 
ideas. I am particularly grateful to Jane Finnis, Will Saunders, Professor Simeon Yates, 
Tonya Nelson and Lucy Sollitt who were seconded to the Digital Culture Project over 9 
months to develop policy ideas and whose work is reflected in this report. This project 
has been a team effort so far, and there is much more to do.

Culture is Digital 7

Executive Summary

The UK has a dual competitive advantage in creative and technological skills4 and our 
future prosperity will be driven by this particular combination of strengths. In March 
2017, the Government set out an ambitious Digital Strategy, aimed at ensuring that 
the UK is the best place to start and grow a digital business and trial new technology, 
and that our digital sectors remain world-leading. This has been amplified by the 
Government’s Industrial Strategy, which set out how the UK will build on its strengths, 
extend them into the future and capitalise on the opportunities before us.

The UK is 5th in the global innovation index and an ‘innovation leader’ on the 2017 
Euro Innovation Scoreboard. We are a tech savvy market, quick to take up and innovate 
with new technology; our capital’s tech firms raised a record £2.45 billion in 2017, 
and evidence shows that the UK and, in particular, London remain the most attractive 
destination in Europe for tech investors, gaining more venture capital investment in 
2017 than Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.5 The Government’s Industrial 
Strategy aims to expand on these successes, providing greater resources that enable 
firms of all kinds to start-up, scale-up and grow. Through the Digital Charter, the 
Government will ensure the internet works for everyone, agreeing norms and rules for 
the online world and putting them into practice. Following the work of the Artificial 
Intelligence review, we will work to make the UK a global centre for AI and data 
innovation and embed the power of these technologies across our economy. 

A fast-growing sector

Creative Industries; those sectors which have their origin in individual creativity, 
skills and talent and which have the potential for wealth and job creation through 
the generation and exploitation of intellectual property, sit within and alongside the 
digital sector.6 Sir Peter Bazalgette’s Independent Review of the Creative Industries 
highlights the significance of these sectors to the UK’s Industrial Strategy. The creative 
industries contributed over £90 billion in GVA in 2016, over 5% of the UK economy 
(comparable to the Construction or Information sectors) and, between 2010 and 2016, 
grew by 45% – faster than any other sector.7 Cultural organisations and practitioners 
are vital components in this success story, contributing just under a third (£26.8 billion) 
of the GVA generated by the Creative Industries8.

A world-class cultural destination

The UK is one of the most exciting cultural destinations in the world; boasting world 
class museums, with the British Museum, the National Gallery and Tate Modern in 
the top ten most visited museums in the world9. Experts in our archive institutions 
preserve a thousand years of iconic national documents and the 3,223 libraries on high 
streets and in communities across Great Britain10 provide a range of services to meet 
the needs of local people. We can celebrate our nation’s rich heritage with our historic 
buildings and monuments ranked 5th on the Nations Brand Index11 and we can boast of 
a cutting-edge performing arts sector with three of the world’s top five universities for 
the performing arts located in the UK. That training quality, in turn, feeds into our UK 
film industry which contributed £5.2 billion to UK GDP in 201512, due to the talent both 
in front of and behind the camera and the quality of production, with the top three 
films released at the UK box office in 2017 being UK qualifying productions13. 

The Digital Culture Project has been about bringing these success stories together. Born 
out of the Culture White Paper14, the Digital Culture Project and the #CultureisDigital 
online consultation was launched in April 2017. Its aim has been to explore how culture 
and technology can work together to drive audience engagement, boost the capability 
of cultural organisations and unleash the creative potential of technology.

Culture is Digital 9

Working across the UK

Although cultural policy itself is devolved to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, 
this report covers the whole of the UK and seeks to highlight digital cultural activities 
across borders. There are common issues to be pursued as each of the devolved 
administrations recognise the significance of technological changes to cultural 
organisations and audiences, and we collectively aspire to extract the maximum 
benefit where proposals have UK wide reach. We have highlighted where actions are 
UK-wide or solely for England. Generally, only those actions being delivered by the Arts 
Council England alone, as its remit is restricted to England, are unavailable for cultural 
organisations in the devolved administrations to participate in and benefit from.

The devolved nations are active in this space. Creative Scotland’s 10 Year Plan 2014-
2024 sets out an expectation that all organisations will build digital thinking into their 
work and ‘Ensure that creative people and organisations have the digital skills and 
capacity to share and market their work’.15 The Welsh Government is committed to 
celebrating the unique culture and heritage of Wales (Prosperity for All, p20)16 and to 
promoting digital access, developing the potential for digital media to promote culture 
through projects such as Casgliad y Werin (People’s Collection Wales).

Themes

The policy commitments in this report congregate around three key themes, each a 
chapter of this report. Below are introductions to each theme:

1. Audiences: using digital technology to engage audiences

Digital experiences are transforming how audiences engage with culture and are 
driving new forms of cultural participation and practice. As technology advances, so do 
the behaviours of audiences, especially younger audiences. We are no longer passive 
receivers of culture; increasingly we expect instant access to all forms of digital content, 
to interact and give rapid feedback. Audiences are creating, adapting, and manipulating, 
as well as appreciating art and culture. In an era where the UK has an online audience 
of 50.4m people17, 76% of adults have a smartphone18 and 80% use the internet 
daily or almost daily19, digital technology is transforming the relationship that cultural 
organisations have with the public. 

Technology allows cultural experiences to be more accessible than ever; whether 
viewing collections online, experiencing immersive theatre or purchasing e-tickets 
for productions. We can look at a painting, read a novel, discover the heritage on our 
doorstep, or listen to music at a moment’s notice, on multiple platforms and wherever 
we are in the world. Cultural organisations are beginning to harness the potential of 
digital technology to engage audiences through new formats and mediums and by 
diversifying their distribution channels.  

In using new technologies, there is the potential to reach out to new as well as existing 
audiences, including those who may have been previously disengaged or uninterested, 
and provide a hook for audiences to experience culture in new or ‘deeper’ ways.

The collection, analysis and improved sharing of audience data is a key opportunity, 
allowing organisations to develop a more informed and responsive relationship with 
existing audiences and to engage new and under-represented audiences. 

With audience statistics showing levels of under-representation from Black, minority 
ethnic and disabled people, and lower socio-economic groups for many of the cultural 
sectors this report emphasises how digital communications and data tools can support 
efforts around audience diversity20 in combination with the provision of cultural content 
and experiences.

2. Skills and the digital capability of cultural organisations

Developing digital skills, for individuals, businesses, government and other organisations 
was at the forefront of the UK’s Digital Strategy and the UK’s Industrial Strategy. 
These set out Government ambitions to ensure that we have the skilled and capable 
workforce necessary for an increasingly digital world. 

Cultural organisations are increasingly using technology to help them deliver across 
many areas of their business. Research21 shows that organisations who benefit most 
from digital technology are those who are digitally mature. Digital Maturity is where 
digital activity is embedded across an organisation as part of the strategic vision and 
throughout every part of the business, from its creative output and audience outreach 
through to e-commerce. 

The cultural sector has particular skills gaps around intellectual property and data 
analysis. Organisations don’t have the skills relating to rights clearance, or access to legal 
advice around intellectual property rights. This lack of expertise is limiting their ability to 
create and exploit digital content. A lack of skills in data analysis is preventing cultural 
organisations from collecting data and using it to develop their business models.

Culture is Digital 11

Our consultation also found that digital leadership – from both trustees and executive 
leaders – within the cultural sector has a significant influence on organisational 
behaviours. Change happens when there is senior recognition of the importance of 
digital skills and the transformational role that technology can play to support creative, 
audience and business model development.

3. Future Strategy: Unleashing the creative potential of
technology 

The UK cultural offer is key to our soft power, as well as an important source of exports 
and inward investment. The UK is recognised as one of the world’s most adept soft 
power nations, ranked second on the Soft Power Index, a ranking for which our strong 
culture and digital sectors are important contributor 22. 

Culture is a key driver for the Tourism sector. The 377,000 listed buildings, almost 
20,000 scheduled monuments and 31 world heritage sites are cited as important 
motivators for visitors to the UK23 and DCMS-sponsored museums inspired 22 million 
overseas visits in 2016/1724 . We export cultural exports of £18 billion which are 
growing quickly25 and the cultural sector is a significant contributor to the GREAT 
Britain Campaign with events such as the Music is GREAT: British Music Showcase at 
MIDEM in June 2017, helping the GREAT campaign deliver economic returns of £2.7 
billion for the UK already.26

Priorities

The Digital Culture Project has highlighted three policy priorities to drive a Digital 
Culture Future Strategy and exploit international opportunities :-

A. Digital Infrastructure for Culture

Our museum and archive collections are the envy of the world; 2,600 English 
museums care for important domestic and international collections, both historic 
and contemporary, and their curation is world renowned and respected. Our cultural 
institutions have responsibility for the curation, protection and preservation of the 
material they look after, for both present and future generations.27 

The Culture White Paper set out the aspiration to make the UK one of the world’s leading 
countries for digitised public collections28. Digitisation has already had a significant impact 
on access to collections; 61% of museums have digitised up to 50% of their collection, 
with half of those with a digitised collection having made some of it available online29.

The National Archives have digitised and published online over 80 million of their 
historical documents, which in 2015-16 received more than 17 million visits. 

A number of projects already in development are aimed at joining up collections, such 
as the British Library-led project for a Single Digital Libraries Presence; The Heritage 
Gateway; The National Archives Discovery Project; ArtUK, and the British Film 
Institute’s Unlocking Film Heritage Programme. However, throughout this project 
there have been calls for a more strategic and coordinated approach to enable more 
connections and curated content to be available across multiple digitised collections, 
across sectors and to improve discoverability for audiences. This change would meet 
the expectations of audiences, scholars and the museums and archives workforce who 
expect digital content to be easy to navigate and open for them to enjoy, contribute to, 
participate in and share. 

Art UK contains over 200,000 digitised art works

B. Innovation

The fast rate of growth in the creative industries is largely driven by a combination 
of creative risk taking and Research and Development (R&D)30. The UK has a world 
beating HEI sector for creative subjects with institutions like Glasgow School of Art, 
University of the Arts London and Goldsmiths University. Students graduate with fully 
converged creative and digital skills and expect to pursue their creative practice using 
new technology. 

The UK is at the cutting edge of innovation and technology globally, attracting more 
overseas investment in R&D than Germany, France and China31. However, our research 
found that the cultural sector, like the wider creative industries, finds it difficult to 
access R&D funding, resulting in less experimentation, access to technical skills and 
expertise, research, hardware and software, as well as time and space to undertake

R&D. The Bazalgette Review of Creative Industries notes that smaller organisations 
lack the capacity for strategic, cross-sectoral R&D which, if properly recognised and 
supported, could propel growth within the sector32. 

The immersive reality market is growing at a fast pace, and is expected to reach 
£100 billion worldwide by 202033, with the UK share currently estimated to be 5%. 
Cultural pioneers such as the Royal Opera House and the Philharmonia Orchestra are 
showcasing British excellence in immersive cultural production and demonstrate the 
potential for cultural organisations to play an influential role in positioning the UK as 
a global leader in content creation for immersive technology. International touring 
projects like the collaboration between Marshmallow Laser Feast and Abandon Normal 
Devices in the award winning show In the Eyes of the Animal – a sensory perspective 
of three species of animals which inhabit British forests – and Rain Room by Random 
International – an installation in which rain falls all around the visitor but its touch 
remains absent due to 3D tracking devices – demonstrate the export potential of 
immersive cultural experiences.

By testing pioneering new experimental ideas and experiences using emerging 
technologies, culture can provide fuel for the wider creative economy. 

C. Collaboration and Partnerships

Highlighted in the Culture White Paper, cultural organisations have a strong history 
of collaboration and successful partnership working and for many UK cultural 
organisations, multiple partnerships are a way of life. Effective tech sector partnerships 
can give cultural organisations access to digital talent, space, data, equipment, funding, 
peer to peer learning opportunities, and experimentation with technologies and new 
ways of working. In turn, the tech sector benefits from access to creative minds and

creative content with which to innovate and a chance to reach out to new audiences to 
test the technology further than conventional consumer testing.

Content creation can also help to drive technical innovations, pushing the possibilities 
of the software and its experiential potential. We are already seeing some impressive 
collaborations and partnerships between the culture and tech sector. For instance, 
Watershed in Bristol is working with the University of Bristol and their industrial 
partners to prototype and showcase new public facing applications of 5G. Government 
wants to create the conditions where more partnerships between cultural and tech 
organisations of all sizes are possible.

Summary of policy commitments

Audiences – using digital technology to engage audiences

1.  Arts Council England and the Heritage Lottery Fund will ensure that funded 
organisations get better at collecting, using and sharing audience data, including:

 a.  Collecting and understanding data on the reach and impact of their digital and 
nondigital work and using it to drive their audience engagement strategies 
ensuring it is done on a consistent basis across the arts and heritage sector;

 b.  Encouraging the use of integrated databases, such as Audience Finder, and the 
sharing of audience insight research, so that all businesses in the sector can 
better understand digital and physical audiences

2.   The Space and The Audience Agency will work with arts and cultural organisations, 
Nesta, the BBC and other content publishers and partners to develop a metrics 
framework and best practice guidance for arts and cultural organisations to 
use when planning and assessing audience engagement across different digital 
platforms.

3.   In order to further broaden cultural engagement and empower communities 
to share their voices, views and creative content digitally, Arts Council England 
will ensure that its Creative People & Places programme makes use of digital 
communications and platforms and that the analysis and learning from the projects 
are widely shared.

4.   We will encourage recipients of UK City of Culture and Cultural Development 
Funding to include ambitions to enhance digital audience engagement in their local 
place-shaping and growth strategies.

Skills and the digital capability of cultural organisations

5.   Arts Council England, working with the Heritage Lottery Fund and partners, will 
create and pilot the use of a Digital Maturity Index for the cultural sector, to enable 
organisations to understand and benchmark their own digital capability and set 
plans in place to make improvements.

6.   Arts Council England, working with the Heritage Lottery Fund and partners, will 
work together to create a Digital Culture Code; a set of guidelines and principles 
which cultural organisations should sign up to in order to demonstrate a 
commitment to developing their own digital maturity and the maturity of the wider 
cultural sector.

7.  Arts Council England will set-up a Digital Culture Network, investing £1.1m over 
two years to create a network of expertise and sharing of best practice across each 
region in England in order to increase its sectors’ digital skills and capability.  The 
Network will:




Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport16

a.  Produce and deliver packages of support to increase the digital maturity of
organisations and improve digital skills within organisations;

b.  Look to partner with technology organisations to deliver training regionally
reflecting key regional trends and needs;

c.  Facilitate partnerships and collaboration between its funded organisations and
the tech sector and others;

d.  Provide targeted support to leaders to increase the digital maturity of their
organisations, including the creation of a digital board bank and guidance of
digital criteria for senior leadership appointments.

8.  In order to build the digital capability of the sectors it supports, the Heritage Lottery 
Fund will:

a.  Fund a £1m campaign which will run over two years, to attract high-quality 
projects to build the sector’s digital capacity, starting in 19/20 with a grant 
budget of £500k p.a.;

b.  Make digital a key feature throughout the Heritage Lottery Fund’s Business 
Transformation programme, with a particular focus on upskilling staff.

9.  In order to support the cultural sector in its understanding of Intellectual Property:

& Intellectual Property Centres and representatives from the cultural sector
to develop guidance and training so that cultural organisations can better 
understand the Intellectual Property framework and its relevance to them.

b.  The Space will lead work with cultural organisations, cultural rights holders and 
seek guidance from the Intellectual Property Office to develop a Cultural Digital 
Rights Code of Practice. 

Future Strategy: Unleashing the creative potential of technology 

10.  The National Archives will work with culture sector representatives to develop a
new strategic approach to the digitisation and presentation of cultural objects,
for example, looking at the common standards needed to make our nation’s great
cultural assets more interoperable34, discoverable and sustainable.

11.  The National Gallery and the Royal Opera House will open up new opportunities for
the culture sector to experiment with new technology and cultural content:

a.  The National Gallery, working with data partners like Nesta, will create an
Innovation Lab so that cultural organisations, and in particular museums, are able
to make best use of advanced digital technologies in enhancing visitor experience
and creating content, and can develop best practice in collaborating with the
technology and academic sectors.

b.  The Royal Opera House will create an Audience Lab to work with diverse
talent, developing new skill sets to create innovative content using emerging
technologies. The Audience Lab will strive to develop cross-sector collaborations
to open up new experiences for audiences.

34  Interoperability refers to the basic ability of computerized systems to connect and communicate with one 
another readily, even if they were developed by widely different manufacturers in different industries




Culture is Digital 17

12.   The Royal Shakespeare Company, the BBC and the Arts and Humanities Research 
Council will share selected Research & Development prototypes and technical assets 
and will offer related capacity building and innovation support to cultural partners 
of all sizes across the UK. This commitment is aimed at mitigating resource issues, 
reducing duplication and encouraging innovation through collaboration.

Conclusion

This report is the first of its kind and, as such, is a call to action to practitioners and 
organisations across the cultural and tech sectors. Here, we propose an approach to 
support the whole digital culture ecology: our audience is both the world-leading and 
the small, voluntary led organisations in communities; technology companies ranging 
from start-ups and scale-ups to large and multinational tech companies; those working 
at the cutting edge of technology development and those using more basic digital tools. 
We encourage cultural and tech sector organisations to support the proposals set out 
here and work together to unlock the opportunities for Digital Culture. There is more 
to be achieved and we hope that individuals and organisations will use the framework 
of this report to coordinate themselves and the expertise and enthusiasm that we have 
seen over the last year.

1. Audiences – using digital technology to 
engage audiences

Introduction

Digital technology is increasingly important in our daily lives; 78% of adults have a 
smartphone35 and 80% use the internet daily or almost daily36. As our interactions with 
technology increase and technology itself continues to advance, audiences’ expectations 
and our work and leisure behaviours are changing; including the way we engage with 
culture. 

The Culture White Paper outlined the Government’s commitment that “everyone 
should have the chance to experience culture, participate in it, create it, and see their 
lives transformed by it”. Engagement in arts and culture can bring joy, improve quality 
of life, boost self esteem, bring communities together, improve mental health, and help 
people to maintain levels of independence and curiosity.37 Our arts, heritage, libraries, 
museums and galleries, films and archives all have a vital role to play in enhancing 
people’s lives, regardless of their background or where they live. 

Technology provides an opportunity to turn up the dial on audience engagement, 
enabling cultural organisations to engage more people and to reach out to new 
audiences. Technology can also allow for a more meaningful or deeper relationship with 
audiences, including more interactivity, with users able to curate their own experiences 
and generate their own content.

Case Study: Park explorer38

The National Trust, in partnership with the Capability Brown Festival 2016, 
developed the Park Explorer, an innovative approach to help visitors access 
information about Petworth Park’s landscape heritage and make more of their visit. 

Thanks to a network of Wi-Fi hotspots, discreetly placed in the Park and Grounds 
of Petworth House, visitors have access to free, safe and secure resources through 
any smart phone or tablet. Devices can be used to pick up animations, videos, 
digital reconstructions of former landscapes, and scenes that you can rub away 
to help visualise the past. Devices with NFC technology also support location-
triggered content; for example visitors can listen to extracts of 18th century letters 
or recreate historic views. Content draws on three years of archaeological research 
at Petworth Park, working with over 100 volunteers. The project was supported by 
the National Lottery through the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Reaching more people

In March 2017, the UK’s online users numbered 50.4 million, with the average person 
spending 83 hours online during that month. The increase in use of smartphones, 
social media and on demand content means that cultural content can be more easily 
distributed amongst audiences through an environment where users interact daily, 
rather than audiences having to actively seek out content. 

With digital content, cultural organisations are able to reach and engage more people 
than could ever have physical access to culture through visits, opening up our nation’s 
cultural offering to all rather than only those living within travelling distance. For 
instance, the Natural History Museum reaches more people in a single month through 
social platforms than visit the museum in person during a whole year.39 In 2016/7, 
National Theatre Live screened 30 productions internationally and sold 240,000 tickets 
for screenings in the US alone. Cinegi Arts&Film40 is trialing a digital distribution 
service that makes it easy to screen films or cultural content in venues such as pubs, 
libraries, museums and community centres throughout the UK, transforming it into a 
pop-up cinema for special events or regular screenings. 

The power of digital communications was seen to great effect in the 330 million social 
media impressions made by Jeremy Deller’s We’re Here Because We’re Here. This 
modern memorial to the opening day of the Battle of the Somme saw 1,400 volunteers 
dressed as First World War soldiers appearing unexpectedly throughout the UK on 1st 
July 2016. Commissioned by 14-18 NOW, the digital reach of this project ensured 
63% of the UK population became aware of it.

Case Study: How digital has increased public libraries’ reach

Public libraries have enhanced the provision of digital access to culture, by making 
digital resources available online and in libraries, and through loans of e-books, 
e-magazines and e-audiobooks. These can be downloaded onto personal devices
allowing people who might not otherwise engage with libraries and books (such
as those who can’t easily visit a library), access to a wide range of material and
connect with their communities. This provision has grown rapidly in recent
years with nearly all local authorities now providing e-lending to library users.
There were 5.47 million annual issues of e-books by public library services in
England in 2016/17 compared with 3.19 million annual issues of both e-books
and e-magazines in 2015/16. Some local authorities are innovating further and
developing these digital library services to address social isolation and foster
community engagement. For instance, projects in Lewisham, West Sussex and
Hampshire are piloting loans of devices like tablets to older people and the
disadvantaged, providing access to digital reading and other cultural opportunities
that might not otherwise have been available.

Reaching new audiences

The Culture White Paper set out the Government’s expectation that cultural 
organisations in receipt of public money should reach out to everyone regardless of 
background, education or geography41 

Cultural engagement data shows fluctuations since 2005/6 when audience data was 
first collected by Government, but varying by sector. For adults data shows rises over 
that period in engagement at museums (up 10 percentage points), Heritage (up 4 
percentage points) and the Arts (up 1 percentage point) whilst libraries has seen a 
significant fall (down 14 percentage points).42 

Although there have been some notable improvements43 there remain gaps with 
black and minority ethnic and disabled people consistently under-represented in arts, 
heritage and museum engagement.44 The Arts Council England’s report into diversity 
covering 2016/2017 also finds engagement is skewed towards those in higher 
socioeconomic groups. The report finds that whilst 31% of the population are in the 
lowest DE socioeconomic groups, these groups represent 22% of ticketed and 24% of 
non-ticketed events for their partner organisations.45 For libraries, however, black and 
ethnic minority use is more than 13 percentage points above the use by those of white 
ethnicity, and there is no longer a significant difference in public library use between 
those with or without a disability/long-standing illness. Libraries also have the highest 
relative use by women, with a gap of 9 percentage points over male use.46

42  Taking Part 16/17 statistical release – Figures in 2016/17 are – 77% of adults have engaged with the arts, 

74% have visited a heritage site in the last year,  52% have visited a museum or gallery in the last year, 
and 52% have visited a museum in the last year.

43  The Heritage sector has seen black and minority ethnic engagement increase (from 51% in 2005/06 to 
58% in 2016/17) and disabled engagement rise (from 64% to 70% over the same period). Museums saw 
a similar increase in black and minority ethnic engagement (from 35% to 44%).

Culture is Digital 21

Digital communication and content are tools which can help deliver greater levels 
of cultural engagement. Younger audiences, in particular, provide an opportunity for 
cultural organisations to increase engagement given their high levels of technological 
sophistication and digital consumption. 99% of 12-15 year olds go online, averaging 
21 hours of online time per week, whilst 77% play computer games, at an average of 
12 hours per week.47 

Case Study: Younger audiences: Playcraft: the world’s first 
live play in Minecraft

In 2017, The Space commissioned Derry Playhouse to produce Playcraft, 
the world’s first play designed, developed and performed in Minecraft and 
simultaneously on the stage. The Playhouse team were particularly keen to engage 
with younger audiences – 9-12 year olds are the prime users of Minecraft.

The Space introduced the team at Derry to Alex Scarrow, author of the TimeRiders 
series for young adults. Alex was commissioned to write a new play that existed 
within the pre-established world he had created in the novels. Scarrow’s time-
travelling plot leant itself to a mixture of performances live on stage and in  
Minecraft, with the actors performing onstage some of the time, and then moving 
into Minecraft.

On the night of the live broadcast in Minecraft and on YouTube, the 200 audience 
members in the theatre in Derry were joined by hundreds of thousands of people 
from across the world watching the production. As of the end of November 2017 
the views of the play across all platforms exceeded 430,000, with views of all 
accompanying artwork content over 700,000, and this is growing over time. The 
recording of the live stream is available on YouTube:

No silver bullet

However, simply making digital content available does not mean that audiences will 
automatically engage.

Our expert advisor on research and evidence, Professor Simeon Yates, found a strong 
association between cultural exclusion (visiting a cultural venue) and digital exclusion 
(being online). Whilst some parts of the population are being ‘double served’ by 
physical and digital cultural offerings, others remain on the outside. This means that, at 
least for some, technology is not a way to drive cultural engagement. 

OFCOM’s Adult Media Literacy Tracker shows that 12% of the adult population 
do not go online and among those that do go online, 28% are ‘narrow users’ of the 
internet, using the internet for a small number of activities.48 These behaviours are 
particularly prevalent amongst the over 75s, of whom 56% do not go online and, 
among those that do go online, 51% are narrow users of the internet.49 

47  Data taken from OFCOM’s Children’s Media Literacy Research 2017.  Report also showed that in 2017 
of 12-15 year olds, 83% have their own smartphone, 55% have their own tablet and 74% have a social 
media profile. Additionally 8 in 10 of 5-15 years olds reported to using YouTube.

48  Narrow users are defined as people who undertake between one and four types of internet activity out of 
the 15 assessed.

Alternatively, some people simply prefer to engage with culture as a live experience 
and a visit to a museum, heritage site, library or theatre is an opportunity to step away 
from digital activity for a few hours.

These levels of digital consumption are not a static picture. Whilst certain groups and 
individuals are currently beyond digital reach, these behaviours change rapidly. For 
example, the proportion of internet users aged over 75 with a social media profile or 
account, doubled between 2015 and 2016 from 19% to 41% whilst 39% of those aged 
65-74 reported using a smartphone in 2016, up 11 percentage points from 201550.

Marriage of digital communications and content

Feedback from our consultation has been clear that to increase participation from 
under-represented audiences, content and digital communications strategies must 
work hand in hand. Cultural organisations should consider the engagement patterns 
of potential audiences rather than presuming digital communications and content will 
automatically reach a wider audience. The most effective audience engagement brings 
together digital communications with content or experiences which are compelling to a 
particular audience or community. 

Case Study: Made in Corby: Reaching new audiences

Corby is an area of low engagement in the arts and ‘Made in Corby’s’ aim is to 
inspire more local Corby people to take the lead in experiencing, creating and 
taking part in high quality arts and cultural activities. Over the first three years, it 
provided 579 separate opportunities for local people to enjoy the arts.

Culture is Digital 23

Over the next three years, ‘Made in Corby’ are launching a new annual outdoor 
arts festival aimed particularly at engaging the ‘Facebook Families’ audience who 
are least likely to participate in arts activities but have high levels of engagement 
with social media. For the first festival, this will include an augmented reality app, 
with families able to hunt the festival’s mascot in places around the town and the 
mascot revealing teasers of festival events. The app will also enable the digital 
creation of installations that are financially unachievable for the festival to deliver 
– for example a waterfall installation cascading down the town’s civic centre.

Made in Corby has been successful in engaging new audiences. For events 
taking place in Q2 2016/17, it was reported an average of 47% of visitors had 
participated in the arts in the last 12 months; suggesting that up to 53% were new 
to the arts.51 Made in Corby is part of the Creative People and Places programme, 
initiated and funded by Arts Council England through the National Lottery.

Cultural Education

One particular area in which cultural organisations have the potential to add value for 
young people is through their digital cultural educational offer. The Culture White Paper 
noted the positive benefits that cultural education and interactions have on young people, 
including increasing the likelihood of a young person going on to further and higher 
education and how ‘experiencing and understanding culture’ is integral to education.

The Arts Council England’s National Portfolio Organisations working with children and 
young people, are asked to outline their plans to use digital technology to capture 
and create content for children and young people as well as offering young people 
opportunities to create their own content. Each of Arts Council England’s ten Bridge 
Organisations (organisations funded to connect the cultural and education sectors)

supports cultural organisations to deliver digital work for and by young people by 
providing training and networking events. Digital activity for children, young people and 
their teachers ranges from online and face to face Continuing Professional Development 
programmes for teachers delivered by organisations including the Hepworth Wakefield, 
Design Museum and V&A Museum, to comprehensive free resources available to 
download from the British Museum and the National Theatre of Wales’ online network 
‘TEAM’ for 16+ creatives.

Examples of work in this area include Birmingham Open Media offering a cutting 
edge technology programme in which children and young people make their own work 
in response to gallery content. Culture24 helps museums to create online learning 
content for children and young people. Technology is being used by cultural 
organisations to address particular barriers, such as the use of Soundbeam, Skoogs and 
iPads in Special Educational Needs music education settings. Connect: Resound is a 
digital music education project52 bringing together music teachers, orchestras and music 
ensembles with children from schools in rural areas across England to transform access 
to music education. Following a successful pilot the North Yorkshire music education 
hub NYMAZ has rolled the programme out in rural locations elsewhere in England.

In 2015/16 Arts Council England partnered with TES Global, British Museum, Victoria & 
Albert museum and Royal Shakespeare Company on the ‘Huge History Lesson’ to deliver 
cultural education teaching resources online. Into Film is a charity working 
UK-wide and funded principally by the National Lottery via the British Film Institute 
(BFI). The Into Film programme promotes watching, making and understanding film for 
5-19 year olds, focusing on film clubs as well as curriculum-based activity, training for
teachers and club leaders, and links to cinemas and the film industry.

School pupils use tech to enhance their field trip

52  The pilot was supported by Art Council England, Nesta and the Art and Humanities Research Council’s 
Digital Research and Development Fund for the Arts, with the roll out receiving funding from the Arts 
Council England.

Culture is Digital 25

Understanding audiences

The collection and analysis of data provides an opportunity to learn more about the 
likes, dislikes, viewing habits and behaviours of different audiences.

Free national online tools such as the Audience Agency’s Audience Finder enable 
cultural organisations to understand, compare and apply audience insight so that they 
can create with audiences in mind. Audience Finder brings together data on all UK 
households with data from over 800 cultural organisations: over 170 million tickets, 
59 million transactions, approximately 280,000 surveys and web analytics from all 
the UK’s major arts and cultural organisations as of January 2018. However, these 
databases are only as good as the evidence base supplied to them, needing data from 
many and varied sources to give real insights to content creators and organisations.

Arts and cultural organisations could also benefit from greater consistency and depth of 
understanding when interpreting digital audience data. 

Case Study: The Marlowe Theatre: Translating Insight into 
Revenue and Engagement

The Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury used Audience Finder along with the 
embedded Audience Spectrum profiling system to understand and predict the 
behaviour of their highest-paying customers – at the Marlowe and elsewhere 
in their local area. Using these insights, they launched a successful campaign to 
attract new audiences identified by Audience Finder as having a similar profile 
to their existing high-paying patrons. Most importantly, they were also able to 
use Audience Finder to pinpoint a small but distinctive new audience in their 
catchment area who would be willing to support new work that is vital for The 
Marlowe’s reputation and positioning. Over the course of a year, they have 
increased their reach in this market by an impressive 50%.

Like many others The Marlowe has to balance its social objectives with financial 
challenges. Beyond their ability to increase targeted revenues through newfound 
insights, they are also able to use Audience Finder to identify and prioritise new and 
low-engaged audiences who can benefit from their discounts and outreach work.

Policy commitments:

1.   Arts Council England and the Heritage Lottery Fund will ensure that funded 
organisations get better at collecting, using and sharing audience data, including:

 a.  Collecting and understanding data on the reach and impact of their digital and 
non digital work and using it to drive their audience engagement strategies 
ensuring it is done on a consistent basis across the arts and heritage sector;

 b.  Encouraging the use of integrated databases, such as Audience Finder, and the 
sharing of audience insight research, so that all businesses in the sector can 
better understand digital and physical audiences.

2.  The Space and The Audience Agency will work with arts and cultural 
organisations, Nesta, the BBC and other content publishers and partners to 
develop a metrics framework and best practice guidance for arts and cultural 
organisations to use when planning and assessing audience engagement across 
different digital platforms.

The role of place 

The Industrial Strategy introduced key policies to support prosperous communities 
throughout the UK and creating thriving communities through culture is central to the 
power of place. The Culture White Paper outlined how our cultural sectors already 
make a crucial contribution to the regeneration, health and wellbeing of our regions, 
cities, towns and villages. They also play a vital role in the UK’s creative clusters53. 
Digital communications enable new engagement with audiences locally, focusing on 
what people care about in their local areas. 

Hull, UK City of Culture in 2017 has shown the impact that cultural investment can 
have. Government funding for Hull of £15 million unlocked £3.3 billion worth of 
investment in the City since winning the nomination in 2013. Analysis shows that 
changes in the perception of the City is attributed as a key factor in securing that 
investment. Hull’s culture led regeneration plan has created 7000+ jobs.

A £2 million Cultural Development Fund was announced in the Autumn 2017 Budget 
to support the role that culture and the creative industries can play to boost local 
economic growth. The creative use of digital technology, communications and tools 
to engage audiences will be an important part of developing and implementing place 
based strategies.

Art Council England’s Creative People and Places (CPP) project has focused on locally-
led arts projects in areas of low cultural engagement since 2013, creating content 
with significance to each local community and giving communities a voice. The CPP 
programme has shown that locally driven and locally relevant work can engage those 
who wouldn’t ordinarily access culture. In the first three years of the CPP project 91% 
of audiences54 belonged to one of the medium or lower engaged audience groups, with 
around three quarters living in the project area of the event they attended. Digital 
tools and technology potentially have a great role to play in further increasing this 
engagement.

Case Study: Creative Scene

The Creative People and Places project in West Yorkshire, has embraced 
digital as a way of creating new content that engages audiences and brings new 
audiences to outdoor arts events, in an area where there are few galleries, theatres 
or public venues. As well as commissioning new digital content, the project also 
presents the work in the public realm, often using digital as part of an immersive 
mix of outdoor digital image projections, beautiful and captivating lighting and 
illuminations, outdoor theatre and interactive artworks.

The commissions celebrate, interpret and reflect the local history, heritage and 
culture – and add some ‘wow’ to the mix – showing the area in a new light.

Policy commitment:

3.  In order to further broaden cultural engagement and empower communities 
to share their voices, view and creative content digitally, Arts Council England 
will ensure that its Creative People & Places programme makes use of digital 
communications and platforms and that the analysis and learning from the 
projects are widely shared.

4.  We will encourage recipients of UK City of Culture and Cultural Development 
Funding to include ambitions to enhance digital audience engagement in their 
local place-shaping and growth strategies.

New cultural experiences

Technology is having a profound effect on cultural activity, especially for younger 
generations. Audiences are no longer simply passive receivers of cultural content. They 
are selecting on-demand content, controlling interactive experiences, instantly sharing 
and distributing content and co-creating artwork itself.

User generated content

User generated content and crowdsourcing projects are driving new and closer 
relationships with audiences. For instance, Historic England’s Enrich the List project 
encourages members of the public to contribute information and images of England’s 
historic buildings and places and has seen 400,000 contributions added to the list. In 
Sleep No More, a Punchdrunk collaboration with MIT Media Lab, the theatre audience 
moves freely through the epic story of Macbeth, creating their own journeys through 
the film noir world.

Mobilising audiences

Audience interactivity has been powerfully mobilised with thousands of organisations 
and communities across the UK marking the Centenary of the First World War through 
local and national projects, many funded from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Young people 
are actively involved in shaping this activity and digital technology plays a key role in

communicating research, telling stories and securing the legacy of the Centenary for the 
next generation. In We are #Youngwummin’55 YouthLink Scotland, youth groups and 
the National Library of Scotland, invite young women to contribute to telling the story 
of the incredible Scottish women who helped win the war. Central Youth Theatre’s 
powerful pieces After Dawn’ and ‘Goodnight My Boys’ based on true stories of West 
Midlands soldiers shot for offences such as desertion or perceived cowardice, are freely 
available on You Tube. 1st Menai Bridge Scout Group on Anglesey are exploring the 
role of Snowdonia and Anglesey Scouts and Scouting during the First World War and 
ensuring their research is easily accessible after the project ends.

Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, led by The Nerve Centre, Reimagine, Remake, Replay 
will see over 4,000 young people take part in activities including making and curating 
their own exhibitions, writing, casting and directing their own films, and creating apps 
and games.

Case Study – New cultural experience – On-line Quilting

Wales-based artists Joanna Wright and Lenka Clayton have created a ‘live’ touring 
social quilting project online (Two itinerant quilters). They have taken inspiration 
from the 18th century travelling quilters who would stay with families in order to 
create patchwork quilts from old clothing, rags and sacks found at each home, and 
involves the artists asking members of the public to donate a small patch of their 
clothing to contribute to a growing quilt. As well as donating a piece of fabric, 
each participant contributes a story, remark or comment linked to the clothing, so 
the collection of stories grows as the physical quilt expands. In return, the artists 
sew a piece of contrasting fabric into participants’ clothing, to replace the piece 
which has been donated.

Culture is Digital 29

The aim of the work, funded by The Space, is to connect people, sharing the 
images and stories online to build a virtual quilt of colour, texture and personal 
narratives over time, alongside the physical quilt. So far, more than 300 people 
have contributed pieces of clothing to the work, 1,800 people have engaged with 
the virtual quilt online and over 7,500 Instagram followers have viewed posts 
regarding the quilt stories. The gallery on Instagram and the emerging quilt can be 
seen at the links below.

Technology and creators

Technological advances also offer creators new ways of producing content and cultural 
experiences for audiences. Super high resolution imagery allows viewers to zoom in to 
focus on every brush stroke, virtual tours allow access to stately homes and monuments 
which are inaccessible to the public for conservation reasons, and immersive reality 
dance performances allow audiences to enjoy new experiences; stripping away time, 
stereotypes and even gravity. CGI technology brings Sir Richard Arkwright to life in the 
‘Arkwright Experience’ at Cromford Mills in Derbyshire, enabling audiences to hear 
first hand about the inventions, money and espionage intrigues from his life. Historical 
Houses Association lets users discover special houses and places by drone, giving a 
novel view of these prize assets. 

Tackling access inequalities

The Taking Part 2016/17 survey shows that although engagement in culture from 
those with long term illness or disability has increased since 2005, there is still a notable 
participation gap56. Support is available to help. For example, UK charity VocalEyes 
provides excellent guidance to cultural organisations on how they can ensure that websites, 
as well as physical premises, are fully accessible to d/Deaf and disabled audiences.

56 The gap has fallen from 9 percentage points in 2005/06 to 5 percentage points in 2016/17.

Digital technology tools can also help close this gap and greatly enhance the experience 
of those with disabilities. Hi-tech glasses like those being developed by the National 
Theatre allow d/Deaf audience members to watch performances with subtitles without 
having to rely on dialogue screens at the side of the auditorium. Mobile apps are 
unlocking cultural content for many users, and apps such as Signly are delivering smart 
signed content directly to a user’s device. We would encourage cultural organisations to 
test and use these new technologies.

Case Study: Signly App and The Roald Dahl Museum and 
Story Centre

The app, developed in collaboration with The Roald Dahl Museum and Story 
Centre, can be pointed at labels throughout the Museum to display British Sign 
Language videos enabling visitors to access information about the exhibits without 
having to wait for interpreted tours or make a ‘special need’ known.

2. Skills and the capability of cultural
organisations

Introduction

A key aim of the Government’s Digital Strategy and Industrial Strategy is to improve 
the digital skills of UK businesses and citizens in order to make the UK a world-leading 
digital economy – one in which our cultural sector can play its part. 

It is predicted that, within 20 years, 90% of all jobs will require some element of digital 
skills57. The Government is committed to ensuring that everyone has access to the 
digital skills they need to thrive in the digital age, increasing their earning power and 
giving better job opportunities. The Industrial Strategy sets out the Government’s 
commitment to helping people develop the skills needed for jobs of the future, including 
investing an additional £406 million in maths, digital and technical skills in England. 
At the start of this year the Department for Education announced the Government’s 
commitment to fully fund basic digital courses from 2020, mirroring the approach 
to maths and English58. In the interim, the Government will continue to support the 
provision of basic digital skills training for adults in colleges and community learning 
centres across England through the Adult Education Budget and other programmes.

A need to improve digital skills

In the cultural sector, there is a need to focus on digital skills from basic skills59 through 
to the specialist digital skills60 to ensure no segment of our workforce is left behind. 
At the same time, digital tools offer opportunities to drive efficiencies in back office 
operations, increase commercial revenues and fundraising, and improve audience reach.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has recently undertaken and 
published a series of reviews and reports.61 All of these reviews highlighted a need 
for DCMS’s Arm’s-Length Bodies to improve the digital capability of their own 
organisation and, in their roles as funders and development agencies, to support cultural 
organisations to do the same. Building digital skills has been identified by the Arts 
Council England as a priority, with 37% of its sectors’ organisations saying that a lack 
of capability and knowledge was a major barrier to achieving their digital aspirations62 
and Heritage Lottery Fund’s consultation on its future direction has a focus on digital

capability so they can better understand the support needed by organisations they fund 
to use digital technologies.

Respondents to our consultation highlighted that digital skills are a key area of 
weakness for many cultural organisations. A Lloyds study63 on small businesses and 
charities64 found that a lack of digital skills and fears linked to online security were 
key reasons for organisations holding back on their potential to do more online65. The 
2017 Digital Culture Survey reports that 70% of organisations reported a major 
positive impact from digital technology on their ability to deliver their mission66 but 
the majority of organisations view themselves as only having basic digital skills67. The 
survey reports that digital skills gaps cover everything from digital production and 
commissioning, to rights clearance68 and data analysis (see Figure 1).

Culture is Digital 33

Digital Maturity

Research69 and our consultation has shown that organisations are more likely to 
experience benefits from digital technologies if they are digitally mature; where digital 
is embedded across an organisation throughout every part of the business, from admin 
and security, to e-commerce and asset management70. 

However, digital maturity will only occur if UK cultural sector leaders have the digital 
literacy and confidence to drive forward the adoption of digital technologies across 
their business plans. The Digital Culture Survey shows that only 38% of organisations 
felt that they are well served with the skills to create this sort of digital strategy71. 

A Digital Maturity Matrix allows organisations to make sustainable and continued 
incremental digital improvements to their businesses. The tool allows organisations 
to make an evidence-based case for digital transformation demonstrating the value in 
investing resources to do so. A number of tools to measure digital maturity have been 
developed and used across organisations in the UK and here we outline two of them. 

Case Study: Breast Cancer Care: Digital Maturity Matrix72

In 2015, Breast Cancer Care developed a digital maturity matrix tool as part of 
its digital strategy review but also wanted to ensure others could benefit from 
it so made it open source. The goal of the index was to quantify a previously 
subjective view on a charity’s digital progress. The tool assessed the charity’s 
existing digital capability across eight dimensions (everything from technology 
to governance), using a series of statements and allowed the organisation to 
set targets for the following year. Based on the digital maturity index, the 
organisation managed to raise their own digital maturity by 24% in just 12 
months. The rights to the tool are now held by the NCVO, who have maintained 
it as an open source tool for the sector with over 800 charities now having used 
the index to increase their own maturity. 

Case Study: Art Fund: Culture sector Digital Maturity Model

The Art Fund underwent an extensive process to evaluate its own digital maturity 
using a model specifically adapted for a cultural organisation. By exploring digital 
maturity models the process enabled the Art Fund to understand the digital gaps 
that it faced as an organisation and the possibilities that working with digital 
technology can bring, while learning about the broader use of technology in 
different sectors. By fully engaging all of its employees to think about digital best 
practice, they have been able to embed new ideas and plans to capitalise on their 
digital future and better fulfil the Art Fund’s mission. The use of a culture sector 
digital maturity model, assessing everything from technology to governance, 
would allow cultural organisations to clearly identify skills and knowledge gaps 
and be able to set appropriate targets for the following year to help address these 
gaps. It will enable better understanding of where they need to invest and be able 
to put into place specific plans for improvement.

69 Lloyds Bank Digital Index for Small Business and Charities (2016)
70  The Arts Council England and Nesta Digital Culture survey 2017, p.25, notes a perceived barrier to the 

uptake of digital technologies by cultural organisations is having ‘no senior manager with a digital remit’. 
71 This figure is 61% for ACE NPOs, Arts Council England and Nesta Digital Culture Survey 2017, p.22.

Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport34

Policy commitment:

5.  Arts Council England, working with the Heritage Lottery Fund and partners, will
create and pilot the use of a Digital Maturity Index for the cultural sector, to
enable organisations to understand and benchmark their own digital capability
and set plans in place to make improvements.

Alongside the Index will sit a Digital Culture Code. The code will set out some core 
principles supported by government and cultural funders to help organisations 
understand what is being asked of them when working with digital tools and technology. 
Principles might include a commitment to data sharing and designing audience 
engagement using data, support for building capacity across organisations (including big 
institutions supporting smaller ones and pooling resources across organisations) and a 
commitment to building digital maturity and the maturity of the wider cultural sector. 

Policy commitment:

6.  Arts Council England, working with the Heritage Lottery Fund and partners,
will work together to create a Digital Culture Code; a set of guidelines and
principles which cultural organisations should sign up to in order demonstrate a
commitment to developing their own digital maturity and the maturity of the
wider cultural sector.

Building Capacity
Arts Council England

It is mandatory for Arts Council England’s National Portfolio Organisations (NPOs) 
receiving £250,000 per annum or more to have a digital policy and plan and Arts 
Council England has developed guidance and training to support NPOs in developing 
these policies and plans. However, Arts Council England intends to further support 
its sectors to develop their digital maturity at scale; in particular to make savings, 
transform business models and reach audiences. 

The Arts Council England and Nesta Digital Culture survey highlighted regional 
variations in access to digital skills73, and found that London has the highest number of 
‘digital leaders’, with organisations outside London feeling less confident in their digital 
skills74. It is therefore important that a regional approach is adopted. 

Arts Council England will invest in a Digital Culture Network to develop its sectors’ 
digital skills and capabilities. It will have a mission to increase the digital maturity of the 
organisations it supports, to embed digital skills, facilitate partnership and collaborative 
working, provide guidance and advice to senior leadership of its organisations on digital, 
sharing expertise and best practice. Since 2015 Google has been running the Digital 
Garage project which has helped 200,000 people in Britain learn crucial skills for the 
digital age. More recently Google have developed a coastal town tour of Google’s 
Digital Garage: a specific programme targeting hospitality and tourism industries in 
seaside communities. As part of the Digital Culture project, Google Arts and Culture will 
explore together with Arts Council England, if a similar specific project for the culture 
sector could be developed to help organisations improve their online presence, reach 
new audiences and create exciting digital experiences.

7.  Arts Council England will set-up a Digital Culture Network, investing £1.1m
over two years to create a network of expertise and sharing of best practice
across each region in England in order to increase its sectors’ digital skills and
capability. The Network will:

a.  Produce and deliver packages of support to increase the digital maturity of
organisations and improve digital skills within organisations;

b.  Look to partner with technology organisations to deliver training regionally
reflecting key regional trends and needs;

c.  Facilitate partnerships and collaboration between arts and cultural
organisations and the tech sector and others;

d.  Provide targeted support to leaders to increase the digital maturity of their
organisations, including the creation of a digital board bank and guidance of
digital criteria for senior leadership appointments.

Heritage Lottery Fund

Almost every project supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund produces digital outputs 
ranging from simple web sites presenting archival images, sound or film, to the 
innovative 3D experience of the Battle of Bannockburn and apps to help people 
identify species at risk. Heritage Lottery Fund recognises there is more it can do to 
support the use of digital technology to conserve and open up heritage.  

The Tailored Review of the Heritage Lottery Fund and National Heritage Memorial 
Fund included a recommendation on digital capability75 and highlighted that Heritage 
Lottery Fund should work strategically to support, heritage projects that use digital, and 
to build the digital skills of organisations working in the heritage sector and those with 
heritage assets. The Digital Culture survey 2017 found that the ‘Heritage bodies’ which 
responded (the majority of which are Museums), are falling behind the wider cultural 
sector in their use of digital technology)76. 

In order to support the Heritage sector to build digital capacity, the Heritage Lottery Fund 
will create a £1 million two year campaign, focused on attracting high quality digital 
skills projects, starting in 2019/20. Heritage Lottery Fund will first seek to understand 
more about how it can support the sector through its Strategic Funding Framework 
consultation, the results of which will inform its ambitions for this campaign.

The Heritage Lottery Fund is also committed to ensuring that digital capability is a 
significant feature in the organisation’s own Business Transformation programme. As 
part of this commitment, they will appoint a Digital Trustee to its Board and appoint 
a new senior post to lead work internally and in its grant-making in the 2018-19 
financial year. 

75  38% of respondents felt that HLF adequately supported the development of digital content, and the use 
of digital technologies by heritage organisations through its investments (62% either said they didn’t 
know, no, or that HLF could do more Tailored review of the Heritage Lottery Fund and National Heritage 
Memorial Fund, UK Government, November 2017. 

76  For instance the survey found that heritage organisations are the least likely to have a mobile-optimised 
site, and are also the least active on social media, with 33% using Instagram and YouTube compared to 
50% of organisations overall, Arts Council England and Nesta Digital Culture Survey 2017.

Policy commitment:

8.  In order to build the digital capability of the sectors it supports, the Heritage
Lottery Fund will;

a.  Fund a £1m campaign which will run over two years, to attract high-quality
projects to build the sector’s digital capacity, starting in 19/20 with a grant
budget of £500k p.a.

b.  Make digital a key feature throughout the Heritage Lottery Fund’s Business
Transformation programme, with a particular focus on upskilling staff.

Working with other DCMS workstreams

The Digital Culture report policy commitments will help support and deliver, where 
appropriate, the digital strands of work identified in The Mendoza Review: an 
independent review of museums in England and the Strategic review of DCMS-
sponsored museums. The museums sector will be represented in all work streams of 
this project to ensure they can work with, and learn from, the wider cultural sector in 
improving their use of digital technologies. 

The Digital Strategy committed to create a Digital Skills Partnership (DSP), bringing 
together technology companies, local businesses, local government, charities and other 
organisations to develop local targeted digital skills training, highlighting excellence 
and avoiding duplication of resources and training. The sectors working with the DSP 
have similar digital skills and capability needs to the cultural sector, especially charities 
and SMEs. DCMS will ensure that the cultural sector is represented in the Digital Skills 
Partnership, appointing representatives to sit on the Digital Enterprise Delivery Group 
in order to align the Digital Culture skills work with the wider work of Government 
on digital skills . Lloyds Bank co-chair this Enterprise delivery group and with their 
experience of having reported on the digital maturity of small businesses and charities

Leadership

The importance of digital leadership is singled out as a theme across a number of 
studies. Research by Fujitsu from 2016 found that for 71% of businesses, the success 
of digital projects is a gamble77. The Lloyds Bank Digital Index for Small Business 
and Charities (2016)78 revealed that almost half lack all five basic digital skills 
(managing information, communicating, transacting, creating and problem solving) 
and that 4 out of 5 charities report investing no money in digital skills, even though 
many recognise their own skills gaps. Digital transformation initiatives are shown to 
fail, in any sector, when they are not led from the top of the organisation. A 2015 
study79 found that lack of engagement and buy-in from senior leadership is a common 
barrier to digital transformation and the 2017 Digital Culture Survey reports that 
organisations experiencing minimum impact from tech changes are less likely to have 
senior managers who are knowledgeable about digital or who distribute responsibility 
for digital across their organisation80.

Cultural leaders and boards set organisational strategies, and digital tools and 
technology should be included across these plans. If leaders understand the importance 
of digital, they will be able to identify where strategic digital investment and resources 
are needed. 

77  Less than a quarter (21%) of IT decision-makers are confident in advising the business on digital projects, 
while over half (59%) admit it’s difficult to know the right choices to make when it comes to digital 
adoption. 

78 The majority of arts and cultural organisations are also charities.

Case study: Royal Historic Palaces – 5 year 
transformation project

In 2013, Historic Royal Palaces (HRP) undertook a 5-year digital change programme 
focussed around improving and modernising the customer journey and experience. 
What HRP realised very early is that the transformation was truly a change 
programme, not an IT programme. Of the 42 projects scheduled to take place, only 
7 were around technology. 35 were about people, process, organisation and culture.

Crucial to this change was Board level leadership, governance and championing of 
digital initiatives. Where operating models need to change – where departments 
need to work differently or be shaped differently – where functions need 
streamlining or centralising – where roles are changing and skills are evolving: 
board level visibility and buy-in are absolutely key.

In Digital Programmes, all of these things can and do happen, because of the 
uniquely cross-cutting nature of digital technology and benefits. Certainly in HRP 
they did. The Programme was led by a Change Stream, which organised Board level 
sponsors for each stream, regular executive level show-and-tells, an executive-led 
programme board, and regular reports to Executive and Trustee Boards.

All this couldn’t make the change painless, but it did make the change happen. 
The results are the delivery of tangible business benefits and new ways of working 
across the organisation.

Data and Business Models

The Industrial Strategy’s Artificial Intelligence and Data-Driven Economy Grand Challenge 
commits to making the UK a global centre for artificial intelligence and data-driven 
innovation and supports sectors to boost their productivity through these and data analytic 
technologies. These commitments reflect the importance of our data economy to the UK’s 
growth and future prosperity. 

For cultural organisations data can provide significant insights. Collecting data not only 
allows cultural organisations to understand their audiences better but the data collected 
– audience demographic data, commercial transactional data, metadata, crowdsourced
data, locations-based data, and machine-generated data – can all be used to help develop
business plans and organisation strategies.  Data is also a powerful tool to challenge
organisational assumptions. The Alan Turing Institute recognises the importance of data
science and is driving forward cross disciplinary work to develop solutions data science
can offer for real-world problems. Through a summer internship programme they will
be encouraging PhD students to join them to analyse data and solve problems, share
knowledge and build networks in an open and collaborative way.

The Government has a clear position on open data81, to be open by default, and 
encourages businesses to take the same approach so new insights and innovative 
approaches can be explored, while also increasing transparency. Data should be shared 
in a fair, safe and equitable fashion between public and private parties, and Data Trusts, 
highlighted in the Industrial Strategy, can contribute to this.

Culture is Digital 39

Case study: Artsadmin-developing an integrated data system

Artsadmin working with Golant Media Ventures and funded by Arts Council 
England, created an integrated data system that combines information on the artists, 
audiences, collaborators, clients, customers, and donors – as well as its projects and 
physical spaces. The purpose of the project was to unlock the value of knowledge 
held in different parts of the organisation. Specifically the project aimed to:

•  Create an interconnected way of gathering and understanding the many types
of data that they collect

•  More effectively connect the people we reach to the activity we deliver

•  Build better connections between our networks and facilitate data sharing

A surprising aspect of the project was that the scoping phase brought about 
significant change in the organisation. Employees reported having a better sense 
of what being ‘data capable and confident’ means in practice: knowing what you 
want out of your data, and why you’re capturing it at all.

transformation project ‘KIWI’

Using data effectively

However, cultural organisations currently lack the capability to use their data effectively. 
Culture Counts report that 80% of cultural organisations surveyed (UK and Australia) are 
‘data shy’- the lowest classification of data-readiness82 and the Arts Council England 
and Nesta Digital Culture Survey 2017 reports that only 18% of organisations use 
audience data to inform the development of new services or products83.

Case studies and consultation responses to this project suggest that the first important 
step for cultural organisations is to understand the best ways to collect data including 
what data is needed and for what purpose, and then learn to use that data to 
provide value to their organisations. There is even greater potential for the sector if 
organisations learn, and are willing, to share and integrate that data across the sector. 

Through the Data Protection Bill, Government will ensure that our data protection 
laws are fit for the digital age so that those collecting data use it in a responsible way 
giving UK citizens confidence that their personal data is secure. DCMS will work with 
the cultural sector to communicate the implications of the Data Protection Bill for the 
data they hold and collect, and to ensure access to guidance and training created by the 
Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). 

Intellectual Property

The Intellectual Property Office (IPO)’s 2015-2020 strategy states that “Intellectual 
Property (IP) is being underutilised, leading to lost opportunities” finding that “only 1 
in 10 [UK firms] has provided any IP training to staff.” The Digital Culture survey tells 
us that only 24% of organisations feel well-served for skills relating to rights clearance, 
and only 26% in relation to legal advice around intellectual property rights84. 

In exploiting intellectual property, the wider cultural sector faces the same key 
challenges as the Creative Industries – lack of knowledge and legal expertise, vulnerable 
to losing control of their creative content85. Cultural organisations often fail to realise 
the benefits of their digital assets, missing out on opportunities to extend audience 
reach and brand awareness via non-commercial distribution or not pursuing commercial 
exploitation. They may limit access to certain types of content or fail to exploit the 
revenue generating opportunities of other content. 

The Space86 has recently examined how various cultural organisations are creating 
digital work and the necessary rights clearance effort involved. Their work indicates that 
rights clearance for cultural projects is often challenging due to the complex underlying 
rights involved and the lack of standardised terminology associated with publishing 
online. There is no method to share best practice in this area and organisations 
often struggle with resource to be able to identify rights holders and develop rights 
agreements from scratch. To respond to these challenges, The Space will consult 
with members from the cultural sector, rights holders, representatives from union 
bodies that represent professional performers and creative practitioners and the IPO 
to examine solutions to make rights clearances better understood and utilised by the 
cultural sector. One proposed step is to create a Code of Practice which would provide 
a template from which rights clearance procedures in the cultural sector could be more 
efficiently handled.  

Improving understanding of Intellectual Property

The UK intellectual property system is world-class87 but new technology can offer 
a challenge to business models and is changing the ways in which IP is being 
commercially exploited. There is a need to maintain a balance between protection and

the other hand. The IPO will lead work to develop guidance and training for the cultural 
sector so that organisations can better understand the relevance of the Intellectual 
Property framework to their work.

Case study: British Library Business & Intellectual 
Property Centres working with cultural organisations

The British Library Business & IP Centre network (which covers public libraries in 
London, Birmingham, Exeter, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, 
Northampton and Sheffield) provided support to hundreds of cultural and creative 
organisations, including theatre schools, radio broadcasters, events management and 
talent management agencies as well as animation and photography studios. Here are 
a couple of examples where these centres have assisted them.

Theatre Workout is an award-winning theatre and events company based in 
London’s West End. They run workshops for over 8,000 people a year, delivered 
by highly trained and experienced performers, artists and practitioners.87 In 2017 
they attended the Business & IP Centre’s Innovating for Growth programme, 
where they received a bespoke programme of support to grow and develop their 
business, taking a step back to look at their branding, marketing, strategy and 
planning and intellectual property needs.

Kalory photography and video studio specialises in creating visual content (photo 
and video), so that a business can redefine their image and perception for their 
customers. Franck Jehanne, co-founder of Kalory, said: “The Innovating for Growth 
team helped us a lot by giving us the confidence to hire our first employee. 
The programme is also really good at forcing you to step back and analyse your 
business. You are often so busy that you neglect your strategy or marketing. By 
raising questions and discussing the business, we changed some crucial elements 
in our branding and commercial strategies. The group sessions were also extremely 
useful. We met entrepreneurs with similar issues but in other industries and that’s 
a great way to make you think outside the box.” 

Policy commitment:

9.  In order to support the cultural sector in its understanding of Intellectual
Property;

a.  The Intellectual Property Office will work with the British Library’s Business
& Intellectual Property Centres and other representatives from the cultural
sector to develop guidance and training for the cultural sector so that cultural
organisations can better understand the Intellectual Property framework and
its relevance to them.

b.  The Space will lead work with cultural organisations, cultural rights holders
and seek guidance from the Intellectual Property Office to develop a Cultural
Digital Rights Code of Practice.

3. Future Strategy: Unleashing the creative
potential of technology

Introduction

The UK is a global leader in culture and creativity and, as we leave the European Union, 
we are committed to maintaining our position on the world stage, to driving creative 
innovation, and to producing talent that is recognised the world over. 

Despite containing less than 1% of the world’s population, we have world leading 
creative industry sectors contributing £91.8 billion in GVA in 2016 with Creative 
Industries growing at twice the rate of the rest of the UK economy. Cultural 
organisations and practitioners contributed just under a third (£26.8 billion) of the GVA 
generated by the Creative Industries.88

The GfK Anholt Nation Brands Index consistently ranks the UK as one of the world’s 
top five destinations for culture.89 The strength of the UK’s culture offering sees it 
project considerable soft power, ranking second on the cultural element, on the back of 
the global reach and influence of state institutions such as the British Council and BBC 
World Service.90 

We export £18 billion in cultural exports which are growing quickly – 16% annual 
growth for service exports and 27% for good exports between 2014-15 (the latest year 
for which statistics are available).91 The GREAT Britain campaign has been successful 
in promoting the best of the country to international audiences, and the cultural sector 
is a significant part of this offering. The British Council reaches more than 500 million 
people online each year through its extensive overseas network. This reach helped 31 
million people engage with its China showcase of the best of UK arts organisation 
content through Dandu – one of China’s main online platforms.

World-class culture

We have world-class museums with three of our national museums in the top ten most 
visited museums in the world92 with each close to 6 million visitors in 2016. Many 
visitors including international visitors, flock to our historic buildings (2.7 million visited 
the Tower of London), monuments (1.4 million visited Stonehenge) and sites (1.1 
million visited the Roman Baths in Bath).93

London’s theatres generated record revenues in 2016 with audiences of 14.3 million94. 
In London, 24% of international tourists visited a theatre whilst the same figure for 
the rest of the country was 18%. Meanwhile, UK gig and festival attendance reached 
31 million in 2016 with 820,000 people coming to the UK specifically to watch live 
music.95 There are more than 200 million visits to the approximate 3,000 public libraries 
in England each year with the Library of Birmingham the most popular with over 1.6 
million visitors in 2016/17.96 The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music 
(ABRSM) is the world leading provider of music exams, providing assessments for over 
600,000 candidates in 93 countries every year using digital platforms to communicate 
with teachers, examiners and learners around the world. In the 2016/17 financial 
year they welcomed over 1.5 million users to the ABRSM website and attracted over 
150,000 subscribers across eight social media platforms.

World-leading digital economy

We also have a world leading digital economy; the UK is 5th in the global innovation 
index and an ‘innovation leader’ on the 2017 Euro Innovation Scoreboard. The 
digital sector contributed £116.5 billion in GVA in 2016, with £32.1 billion of service 
sector exports and £14.8 billion of goods sector exports. The digital sector is growing 
faster than the average for the UK economy with digital sector GVA growing by 5.8% 
between 2015-16 compared to 3.5% for the whole of the UK.97

The Government is delivering superfast broadband and local full fibre networks 
to the nation. This includes supporting investment to provide superfast broadband 
coverage to as many premises as possible beyond the 95% level achieved in December 
2017; introducing a Universal Service Obligation so that by 2020 everyone across the

Culture is Digital 45

UK will have a clear, enforceable right to request high speed broadband; and supporting 
investment to stimulate private investment in full fibre connections by 2021.

The UK is a tech savvy market, quick to take up and innovate with new technology; our 
capital’s tech firms raised a record £2.45 billion in 2017 and evidence shows that the 
UK and London particularly remain the most attractive destination in Europe for tech 
investors, gaining more venture capital investment in 2017 than Germany, France, Spain 
and Ireland combined.98 As the UK prepares to leave the EU, this combined strength in 
the digital and cultural sectors is key to the UK’s future economic prospects.

Opportunities

For creators and for cultural organisations, this era of digital activity, investment and 
ambition presents opportunities for the UK to lead the way in creating new art and 
cultural experiences with technology. Creators maximising their digital capabilities 
will enhance any export opportunities. The speed of current technological change is 
unprecedented and whole industries are being disrupted by digital innovation, including 
the cultural sector. Immersive and augmented reality are changing the way in which 
we are able to experience the world around us, offering a particular opportunity as 
international demand is increasing.

A. Digital Infrastructure for Culture

The Digital Strategy set out the Government’s aspirations to build world-class 
digital infrastructure, to ensure ‘‘that everyone, wherever they live and however they 
connect, can make full use of digital services and benefit from participation in the digital 
economy”99 with commitments to become a world leader in 5G and to increase 
coverage of full-fibre. Our consultation and research have shown that the cultural 
sector currently lacks the infrastructure and the operating and funding models needed 
to thrive in a digital landscape. 

Digitising Collections

The Culture White Paper set out the ambition to make the UK one of the world’s 
leading countries for digitised public collections and use of technology to enhance the 
online experience of users. The paper aspired for users “to enjoy a seamless experience 
online, and have the chance to access particular collections in depth as well as search 
across all collections100”.

The ambition is with good reason. The richness and variety of our national museum 
collections are the envy of the world, captivating to audiences and scholars in every 
corner of the globe. Creating digitised versions of collection items is already the core 
work of many museums; 61% of our cultural institutions have digitised up to half of 
their collection. Half of those with a digitised collection have made some of it available 
online, whether these are being added to collections databases, for the creation of 
online exhibitions, or for sharing on social media.101 As noted in the Mendoza review of 
Museums, dynamic collections curation and management are what our museums exist 
to do; “to protect and take care of the collections they hold, and to make them accessible 
to the public, not just physically, but meaningfully as well.” Whether you visit the 
Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth or the British Museum in London, the high quality

The Cultural Protection Fund (CPF) managed by the British Council, in partnership 
with DCMS, supports efforts to keep cultural heritage sites and objects safe, as well 
as the recording, conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. This has included 
awards to digitally document heritage sites at risk in Syria, digitise a range of written 
and photographic material held in archives in Sudan and an interactive 3D model of 
Ksar Said Palace in Tunisia.103

Successes

Some digitised collections are attracting huge numbers of online visits from audiences, 
both domestic and international. The Natural History Museum’s Digitised Specimens 
and Records portal was visited almost 75,000 times in 2017, with 713 million records 
downloaded between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017. They also report 
significant international reach with 54% of views coming from outside of the UK104. The 
British Library has now grown its digital library system to host over 120,000 e-books 
and over 2 million e-journal articles105. 

The Welsh Government awarded a grant to The National Library of Wales (NLW) to 
develop a National Digital Library Service in partnership with other Welsh libraries, 
launched in March 2016. The partnership provides people across Wales with free access 
to a wide range of online content including family history resources, newspapers and 
general reference material. The partnership also provides free online remote access to 
e-books, e-magazines and e-audio books.

There are also sites pulling together or aggregating content from across collections. 
Google Arts and Culture partners with cultural institutions using free tools and 
technology to draw together millions of artworks, historical sites and stories onto one

are not physically accessible to the public and since its launch in February 2016, the 
site has had more than 2.5 million unique users with over 50% from overseas, again 
demonstrating the potential for international reach.106

Online curation can unlock access to cultural experiences and audience reach otherwise 
unimaginable and using social media to showcase digitised material can raise the profile 
of items, exhibitions and collections. 

3D Sunflowers – National Gallery 

Over three days in Summer 2017 a National Gallery-led initiative saw almost 13 
million people globally experience #sunflowers live Vincent Van Gogh’s Sunflower 
paintings through VR and Facebook Lives107. A virtual reality exhibition brought together 
five of Vincent’s sunflower paintings, sourced from five institutions across the world 
with a narration by Willem van Gogh, the great-grandson of Theo van Gogh (Vincent’s 
brother), as its unseen guide. The Manchester Plinth AR project was the first of its 
kind in the UK, presenting art through augmented reality in public spaces. It brings 
artefacts out of the gallery and into the city meaning they’re accessible for everybody 
to experience and enjoy.

Case Study: The People’s Collection Wales- a digital 
heritage programme

People’s Collection Wales is a bilingual, digital platform complemented by a 
wider programme of activities, allowing users to discover, share and contribute 
to an online collection of Welsh heritage ensuring the rich history of Wales is 
celebrated and preserved. The programme is funded by the Welsh Government 
and delivered by a federated partnership of three national cultural and heritage 
bodies. Organisations, community groups and individuals are encouraged to upload 
photographs, recordings and documents that hold stories about Wales. To date 
over 100,000 items have been added to the collection.

The programme also offers a number of training services and support for groups 
and individuals interested in digitising Welsh Heritage and its website has a section 
specifically tailored to provide resources for teachers.

Case Study: Archiving the Hull City of Culture 2017

Hull was UK City of Culture 2017, and Hull University Archives have worked to 
capture this incredible year while it was happening. No UK city had undertaken 
the creation of a born-digital archive of this scale before; to build a truly complete 
picture, the team had to be involved right from the start – after the event would 
have been too late.

The Archive will be a centrally collated record of activity from before, during and 
after 2017, showing the whole life cycle of the City of Culture. An estimated 
100,000 digital records – including photographs, films, minutes, sound recordings, 
scripts, planning documents and contracts – will document the development 
process, the performances, and the experience of people of Hull who engaged with 
events. The majority of records are from The Culture Company, (who were formed 
to deliver the year’s activities) alongside artist and participant depositors including 
the University of Hull and the BBC.

The City of Culture Archive will be crucial for its evidential and research value and 
will be part of the collective memory of the city. Archives underpin other parts of 
the cultural sector; as part of the legacy programme the archive will be used by 
artists and students to inspire new creative work. It will benefit future projects too, 
as the team are creating a toolkit that documents best practice and addresses the 
digital challenges surrounding the archiving of large cultural events as they happen.




Culture is Digital 49

We Are Hull by Zsolt Balogh, Hull City of Culture 

In creating the digital record of our cultural assets organisations, some of the best 
examples consider how the digital asset will fit with the physical one and how this can 
help to increase the audience’s understanding and engagement. A good demonstration 
of this is the Smartify108 app, developed by a UK-based company, which allows users to 
scan and identify artworks providing information about them and allowing users to build 
their own personal gallery. Not only has the company already partnered with a number 
of UK-based galleries including The National Gallery, The Royal Academy of Arts and the 
Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, but it is spreading its reach internationally being 
used in locations in the Netherlands, France, America and Russia to name a few.

Challenges

Despite the audience and scholarly appeal of some digitised collections, our 
consultation highlighted difficulties. Projects can be expensive and require specialist 
equipment, expertise, time and resource and are delivered with varying degrees of 
success. Public funding to digitise collections has historically been largely responsive 
to calls from individual organisations with little cross sector strategy and no alignment 
to ensure that digitised cultural content across projects and collections can be easily 
connected. Digitised collections are often difficult to discover when searching online 
due to poor quality metadata, with search engines not revealing links to individual 
collection items on the institutions’ websites, and audiences instead being directed to 
poor quality images with little or no detailed curation.

Differences in data standards and openness mean that it is difficult to curate across 
collections and create new online exhibitions or content for audiences and limiting 
the educational value of the digitised asset109. Unless images are tagged in a certain 
way, content aggregators will not be able to gather the image when searched. This has 
implications for modern audiences who expect digital content to be easy to navigate 
and to be open for them to enjoy, contribute, participate and share. 

A strategic approach to digitisation

Existing public funding spent on digitising collections,110 could be more strategic 
and co-ordinated. This would help improve the impact of projects with a focus on 
preservation, curation and public access at the forefront of their design. 

The National Archives have a well-developed digital strategy that embeds digital across 
the whole organisation and also supports a wider ‘archive ecology’. Building on their 
strong leadership and experience, the National Archives will convene a taskforce to 
address the barriers to the strategic digitisation of collections. The group will have a 
specific remit to devise the common standards to make our assets more interoperable 
and discoverable. Within this work they will a consider a content strategy, addressing 
sustainability, and the possible economic models available to fund digitisation. They 
will consider how to develop standards which will enable collections to be used in 
immersive tech projects. 

Box 1- Case study: The National Archives – developing an 
archive ecology

As the leader for the whole of the archives sector in England, The National 
Archives works within an “archive ecology” made up of collections spanning all 
sizes, eras and format, including many digital archives. The National Archives has 
a strategy that embeds digital across the whole organisation and supports their 
ambition to be “a digital archive by instinct and design”, and they are supporting 
the archive ecology in digital development too. 

The National Archives serves as a kind of aggregator of UK collections, and 
this deep collections knowledge is now available to researchers online all over 

109  This point is underlined in the The Mendoza Review: an independent review of museums in England: “For 
research, digitisation offers the opportunity to look at metadata in new ways, link collections from disparate 
sources, and conduct new forms of analysis”, UK Government, p.64. 

110  The report Digitisation in the UK: The case for a UK framework found in 2005, spend on digitisation of 
collections in the UK had already hit £130 million, p.2, JISC.

Culture is Digital 51

the world via its Discovery system. Archives can now add their own collections 
metadata directly into it, affording The National Archives an opportunity to focus 
on improving data quality and building data and digital literacy across the archival 
sector. This is also a content ecology in which open data sits easily alongside 
commercial partnerships and licensing and where experimenting and researching 
new ways of packaging and exploring content are possible.

This vision of content aggregation is analogous to the way other sectors have 
recognised the value of taking a collaborative, strategic approach to digital 
infrastructure – often referred to as a digital ecosystem. The travel industry, 
through sites like Skyscanner, allows users to search multiple competitor databases 
to provide precise information based on when and where we wish to travel. 
NewsNow aggregates news feeds and allows you to filter and set preferences 
based on your hot topics, from football teams to lifestyles. Amazon now offers a 
doorway to thousands of tiny online retailers, offering them a platform to sell to a 
global audience. The cultural sector can learn from these kinds of user experiences 
to break down barriers between collections of digital cultural content. 

Policy commitment:

10.  The National Archives will work with culture sector representatives to develop a
new strategic approach to the digitisation and presentation of cultural objects,
for example, looking at the common standards needed to make our nation’s
great cultural assets more interoperable, discoverable and sustainable.

Live to Digital

The digital transmission of live performances to locations a long way from the theatre 
or ‘Live to Digital111’ is a relatively recent development but has expanded in volume 
and range over the last decade. Research suggests that audiences see Live to Digital as 
a distinct experience with little evidence of any cannibalisation of live audiences, and 
something that can act as a ‘halo effect’ increasing interest in live events.112 It is also 
an expanding market, with MTM reporting in 2015 that 90% of arts organisations have 
produced some form of live-to-digital production.113 

The UK is host to significant activity in the Live to Digital arena; driving both audience 
engagement and commercial revenue streams. Live to Digital can reach into ‘closed 
communities’ including community centres and care homes, and through live streaming 
platforms reach harder to reach audiences

Event Cinema – the live broadcasting of cultural events (for example ballet and 
comedy) in cinema – currently accounts for between 1% – 3% of global box office 
receipts and has seen huge commercial successes with Billy Elliot Live and a 50th 
anniversary episode of Doctor Who which broke records.114 The Space undertook 28 
performance capture commissions across 2016 and 2017. This included London 1666, 
a 120 meter long, 10 meter high replica of the City of London set ablaze on the River 
Thames, which reached an online audience of 3.8 million. 

111  We define live-to-digital arts as a live performance, event or experience, captured and distributed 
digitally, through television, cinema, or online. The content is recorded live but does not need to be 
distributed live 

112  AEA Consulting Report From-Live to Digital, p.12 finds 66% of audiences and 77% of creators see live-
to-digital theatre shows as a distinct experience. Consistent with this, Nesta (2014) uses  data from box 
offices to show that NT Live broadcasts had increased audiences for regional venues .

The British Library, National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales have 
partnered with 22 major libraries across the UK to form a ‘Living Knowledge Network’ 
which amongst other activities, live-screens world class talks and debates held within an 
individual library across its network.115 For example, Michael Palin in Conversation with 
Joan Bakewell was streamed in 6 libraries and watched by over 170 people, whilst Women, 
Witches and Witch Trials was screened in 11 libraries and attracted over 240 attendees. 

Riverside Studios is currently in the final year of a redevelopment to create a 90,000 
sq ft space, with the aspiration to turn itself into a national centre of excellence and 
innovation in the Live-to-Digital arts arena. At the heart of Riverside’s vision is a 
partnership-led model, that allows arts organisations, universities, community groups 
and technology companies to explore new ways of making and sharing content.

Challenges, however, remain. Significantly, the cost of making online content of sufficient 
quality to satisfy audience expectations remains prohibitive to many, despite the cost of 
equipment falling significantly, a point that was made in our stakeholder consultations. 

To help develop the sector further, Arts Council England will bring together a group 
of organisations working on live to digital projects. This will ensure that those 
working in this area become more aware of each other’s activities and help encourage 
collaborations to develop. The group will also help develop a shared understanding of 
what is required for Live to Digital to flourish.

B. Innovation

The UK’s Industrial Strategy set out a clear ambition to be the world’s most 
innovative economy, building on the UK’s great historic strengths in developing and 
deploying new ideas. It includes commitments to raise total R&D investment to 2.4% 
by 2027, increasing the rate of R&D tax credit to 12%, and investing £725 million in 
New Industrial Strategy Fund programmes to capture the value of innovation. 

115  The Living Knowledge Network is being run for a two year pilot period between 2016-18 and is funded 
by the Arts Council England and the British Library.

Culture is Digital 53

Creating with new technology allows artists to push the boundaries of what’s possible 
and create transformative experiences for audiences, for technology to inspire cultural 
production, and for creative content to test the applications of technology.

Case Studies: Cutting edge innovation and culture

FuturePlay played the Edinburgh Fringe Festival both in 2016 and 2017, and 
celebrates, explores and showcases cutting-edge creative content and ideas at 
the intersection of art and technology. The 2017 event featured a Virtual Reality 
Studio, a gaming and interactive Tech Zone, and an Immersive Art Gallery powered 
by Google Tilt Brush. The 2017 event attracted 5,000 visitors across 24 days.116

Google Arts and Culture and the Natural History Museum have partnered together 
to bring the Rhomaleosaurus, a pre-historic sea dragon to life using a 360 degree 
virtual reality experience, and gives an account of how this animal would have lived.

Home in Manchester staged Paul Auster’s City of Glass featuring a VR 
experience in the auditorium designed to immerse the audience still further in the 
noir detective thriller.

Natural History Museum’s virtual reality colossal Rhomaleosaurus

Tech and content development in step

A recent review by the BBC of its R&D activity highlighted the importance of the 
relationship between media technology and content. This blended approach to content 
and tech development within the BBC enabled the development of Piero, the sports 
analysis software invented by the BBC, which enables sports commentators to dissect 
and describe action by augmenting the live video with graphical overlays. Similarly, the 
BBC’s recent interactive drama the Inspection Chamber, in which the listener plays 
the fourth character in a radio play using technology such as Amazon’s Alexa, was a 
creative and technical response to the opportunities presented by the emerging ability 
to talk to machines.

116  Future Play was supported by the National Lottery through Creative Scotland, and was produced by 
Riverside Studios in conjunction with Assembly Festival

The UK’s Offer

We have fantastic talent in the UK for creating with technology nurtured by our world 
beating Higher Education Institutions such as Glasgow School of Art, University of the 
Arts London, and Goldsmiths University. Our universities provide training in creative 
tech, with students engaged in highly creative, applied and problem-based learning 
involving a wide range of technologies.117 

Glasgow School of Simulation and Visualisation

We also have creative spaces which exist to allow creators to learn new digital skills and 
work with new technology. For example Near Now in Nottingham has been supporting 
artists to experiment with virtual reality in a Virtual Reality Residences programme. 
The National Theatre has launched The Immersive Storytelling Studio to create a 
generation of digital storytellers. Digital Catapult Centres in the North East and Tees 
Valley, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Sussex and London118 are accelerating the adoption 
of advanced digital technologies by the creative industries and Somerset House 
Studios provides space for a community of artists working with technology. At the 
community level, the growing number of Makerspaces in public libraries provides access, 
skills, equipment and a network of support which helps people turn their creative ideas 
and inspirations into small enterprises.119

117  In practice this means: graphic design and architecture students learning to code so as to produce 
designs for brands, buildings and beyond; game design and film students learning to code to develop 
on screen and immersive narrative experiences; fashion and interaction design students using physical 
computing to prototype new haptic interactions that respond to the body; fine art and performance 
students using technology to develop large scale and interactive artworks and performances that explore 
and expose the techno-social world we now inhabit.

118  Digital Catapult is a technology innovation centre that aims to increase productivity and 
competitiveness in existing businesses and enable the creation of entirely new digital products and 
services that add value through new or disruptive business models.

119  For example Hampshire Libraries has partnered with the University of Southampton to create an 
immersive virtual reality experience in their Makerspace - ‘The Makery’. As well as giving tasters of 
virtual reality, the kit is also available for digital prototyping, virtual architecture  fly-throughs, and even 
for creating immersive art.

There are a number of developing funding streams for immersive culture projects. 
CreativeXR, a programme developed by Digital Catapult and Arts Council England, 
provided seed funding to 20 creative and technical collaborations to develop concepts 
and prototypes of immersive (virtual and augmented reality) content.120 The BFI’s 
Film Fund was reformed in Autumn 2017 to remove running length and theatrical 
requirement restrictions and to embrace interactive and immersive projects. The Arts 
and Humanities Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research 
Council are funding 32 research projects around the themes of Memory, Place and 
Performance exploring the future of immersive experiences. The projects will bring 
creative and technology researchers and businesses together to develop concepts and 
prototypes suitable for further funding. 

State of R&D in the Cultural Sector

Creative industries, including the cultural sector, invest substantially in R&D. Analysis 
from the Enterprise Research Centre for Nesta suggests that the creative industries are 
as likely as manufacturing firms to conduct in-house and external R&D and be more 
likely than services firms to do so.121

However, the creative industries sector faces particular barriers to R&D including: 
fragmentation – SMEs and micro-businesses (of which there are many in the cultural 
and creative sectors) are sometimes less well placed to bid for, and manage, large-
scale funding awards that could propel growth and build networks of expertise; the 
ideas rich, IP heavy nature of creative business assets which are not always recognised 
as collateral; and cultural factors – where creative research and its application has 
sometimes been seen as separate to hard industrial research, even though it often 
involves many of the same technologies.

120  The project is joint funded by ACE and Innovate UK, and participants include Aardman, Figment 
Productions, Pilot Theatre, and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.

Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport56

Additional issues raised during our stakeholder engagement included R&D not being 
something that cultural organisations are generally able to self finance and investment in 
cultural projects tending to be awarded to time limited projects leaving little space for the 
experimentation needed when working with new technologies. Running parallel to this 
funding challenge is often a fear of risk taking and failure within our cultural organisations, 
particularly within our larger, long established institutions and organisations. 

Recognising the problem, in 2012-15, Arts Council England, Nesta and the Arts and 
Humanities Research Council ran a Digital R&D Fund for the Arts, investing £7 
million to support collaboration between arts organisations, technology providers, 
and researchers. The fund tested the impacts of a dedicated R&D funding stream for 
arts and culture and delivered significant positive impact for participating arts and 
cultural organisations particularly in terms of testing approaches towards audience 
development. Critically, an evaluation confirmed that the projects would not have 
taken place without the Fund.

Case Study: Impact of the Digital R&D Fund

Riot 1831 @ Nottingham Castle is an augmented reality exhibition presenting 
accounts of real people who witnessed or were involved in the attack on 
Nottingham Castle during 1831. Research during the project found the AR 
element significantly helped audiences to engage with the events; 79% felt the 
stories helped them understand the history better and 85% agreed the interactive 
elements helped them remember the experience. An evaluation found the project 
made Nottingham City Museums & Galleries less risk averse, and now carry out 
research on what organisations are doing in their exhibitions to inform their own 
exhibitions. The project was also the catalyst for the organisation to develop a 
digital media strategy, and at a practical level led to senior staff using technology 
much more to present ideas.

The National Holocaust Centre and Museum (NHC) worked with a technology 
and research partner, to develop the Forever Project which aims to preserve the 
live experience of interacting with a Holocaust survivor for future generations. The 
funding supported software research and development that creates the illusion of 
interacting directly in real time with a holocaust survivor (through a combination 
of virtual reality and real-time speak recognition technologies). For NHC this 
represented a first technological project. The project also produced a ‘how to 
guide’ to help other arts organisations ‘immortialise’ any person containing 
information about methods, costs and resources.

Remedies

A number of approaches and measures, including through the Industrial Strategy, are 
addressing the issues restricting innovation in the sector. 

Some cultural organisations are tackling the low tolerance to risk by embracing staged 
development models, where funding is released in stages so that tech projects can 
be assessed, and altered, as they develop. Examples include the Space’s ‘amber light’ 
staged development process.122

122  The Space undertakes an initial scoping phase designed to ensure clarity of the aim, objectives and focus 
of any project under this approach. This ‘amber light’ process is designed to explore: what is the target 
audience engagement and distribution plan, technical development and production, underlying rights 
clearance, budgeting and scheduling, Key Performance Indicators, data evaluation methods, and the 
longer term sustainability of similar work.

project Sculpture.com

Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP) wanted help to enhance the on-site experiences 
for visitors of the park and grow their online presence with potential visitors. The 
development process gave YSP the opportunity to work closely with the Space on 
a detailed scoping process and develop a digital project brief based on how their 
visitors were already using platforms and technologies in the park (i.e. mobile 
phones, photography, Instagram and physical object based interaction). 

YSP are now working with a leading interactive studio (Studio Moniker) to develop 
a 3D web application that helps visitors find their way around the park, whilst 
interacting and engaging with key artworks. This is helping YSP take great steps 
towards creating more innovative digital work with audience engagement at the 
heart of its development. Sculpture.com is now in testing on site, and will have a 
full roll out for the Easter holidays 2018.

To increase innovation within the sector, Arts Council England and the Heritage Lottery 
Fund will ensure that digital projects – including immersive cultural content – are 
fundable through existing funding streams. They will also encourage the sector to use a 
staged development approach to the development of innovative digital cultural content.

The Government is supporting R&D in the sector by investing £39 million, from the 
Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, in the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s 
Creative Industries Cluster Programme. The Programme’s objectives are to deliver 
partnerships or clusters between universities and creative businesses across the country, 
to address a distinct and measurable challenge for each of the clusters. The Programme 
will leverage additional funding from the university and private sector that will take 
the total investment to around £80m, also enabling the creation of a National Creative 
Industries Policy and Evidence Centre.

As part of the Industrial Strategy, this Government has also committed up to £33 
million worth of funding through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund’s Audience of 
the Future programme into pioneering immersive technologies and experiences like 
virtual reality and augmented reality.123

This investment will establish a programme of industry-led activities including public 
demonstrators, collaborative R&D, and a new Industry Centre of Excellence, bringing 
creatives, researchers and technologists together to create new and exciting immersive-
content. Government encourages cultural organisations to lead the way in engaging 
with these funding opportunities, using their unique position as the nexus between 
creativity and technology to produce innovative new content. 

Government, also through the Industrial Strategy, is investing £176 million to support 
5G development. This money is open to cultural organisations with Watershed in 
Bristol, a leading film culture and digital media centre in the South West, part of the 5G 
trial. On the weekend of 17 and 18 March 2018, Watershed, Smart Internet Lab at the 
University of Bristol and We The Curious will host the Layered Realities Weekend 5G 
showcase launching the world’s first public 5G testbed, with Bristol audiences invited to 
experience the potential of 5G at a series of free experimental public events

New experimental spaces

To provide greater opportunities for cultural organisations to experiment, the National 
Gallery is working with data partners like Nesta to create an Innovation Lab. The lab will 
support the gallery’s own programmes and help with its long term strategic decision 
making, as well as providing a valuable resource for the museum sector and wider 
cultural sector. It will focus on three areas:- Using advanced technology to enhance the 
visitor experience; developing partnership models between arts, digital and academic 
institutions in support of London’s creative cluster; and a digital project incubator to 
help develop the digital capability of institutions in the museum sector.

123  All Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund Wave 2 programmes are subject to a final business case when 
further details on funding will be made available.

Culture is Digital 59

The Royal Opera House will set up a space for experimentation to develop new skill 
sets and innovative content on emerging tech platforms. A new department; the 
Audience Labs – will focus on experimenting with immersive technology to open up 
new experiences for audiences. With opera and ballet traditionally bringing together all 
art forms, from music to fashion, to design, creative technologists and beyond the Royal 
Opera House is well placed to develop collaborations across the cultural and technology 
sectors. 

The Royal Shakespeare Company, BBC and Arts and Humanities Research Council, who 
are recognised as sector leaders in creative tech projects, will help mitigate resourcing 
issues for the sector by sharing technical assets, capacity building and innovation 
support to help the upskilling of UK cultural organisations of all sizes.

Policy commitment:

11.  The National Gallery and the Royal Opera House will open up new opportunities 
for the culture sector to experiment with new technology and cultural content:

 a.  The National Gallery, working with data partners like Nesta, will create an 
Innovation Lab so that cultural organisations, and in particular museums, 
are able to make best use of advanced digital technologies in enhancing 
visitor experience and creating content, and can develop best practice in 
collaborating with the technology and academic sectors.

 b.  The Royal Opera House will create an Audience Lab to work with diverse 
talent, developing new skill sets to create innovative content using 
emerging technologies. The Audience Lab will strive to develop cross-sector 
collaborations to open up new experiences for audiences.

12.  The Royal Shakespeare Company, the BBC and the Arts and Humanities 
Research Council will share selected R&D prototypes and technical assets and 
will offer related capacity building and innovation support to cultural partners 
of all sizes across the UK.  This commitment is aimed at mitigating resource 
issues, reducing duplication and encouraging innovation through collaboration.

C. Collaboration and Partnerships

As digital technology advances, the cultural sector is adapting and evolving to 
embrace new ways of thinking, working and creating, including partnering with 
technology companies. Cultural organisations have a strong history of collaboration 
and successful partnership working: museums and galleries across the country share 
and loan collections; heritage organisations come together to save properties at risk; 
co-productions occur in theatres, and archives partner in pursuit of joint research aims. 

The benefits of collaborations are multifaceted, including increased capacity, sharing 
skills and knowledge, increasing access to collections, reaching new audiences and 
accessing cutting edge research and new knowledge. 

Case Study: BBC Civilisations – Creating Digital 
Opportunities

The BBC’s Civilisations Festival in Spring 2018 sees the BBC partnering with 
museums, galleries and libraries of all sizes from across the UK around the BBC’s 
series Civilisations which tells the story of human civilisation through art from 
prehistory to the present. This nine-part series is a re-imagination of Kenneth 
Clark’s 1960’s landmark series ‘Civilisation’ and explores themes like creation, the 
human body and colour. 

The BBC is offering organisations access to a suite of exclusive digital tools and a 
wealth of R&D expertise to help guide them in creating innovative digital content 
that will complement the programme. The experiences they make will be trialled 
on BBC Taster, the BBC’s public-facing platform for experiments. Museums are also 
being asked to contribute content for a new augmented reality (AR) app.

There are increasing opportunities for the cultural and technology sectors to collaborate 
and experiment. These partnerships are increasingly happening, from large technology 
companies to tech start-ups. However, we want to see more, especially among mid and 
micro sized cultural organisations.

Case Study: Cutting edge partnership between culture and 
technology

The Scottish Ten is a collaboration between Historic Environment Scotland 
and The Glasgow School of Art’s School of Simulation and Visualisation, using 
cutting-edge digital technologies to create exceptionally accurate digital models of 
Scotland’s five World Heritage Sites and five overseas international sites.

The accuracy of the digital models means they can be used to monitor damage, 
informing conservation and management strategies. The scan data can also be 
used to create models or animations to enhance public access and understanding, 
and to digitally reconstruct how monuments would have appeared at different 
periods in time.

The project positions Scotland as a world leader in documentation and 
visualisation of the historic environment.

Barriers

However, our consultation raised a number of barriers to partnerships and collaboration 
between cultural and technology businesses:

•  A lack of shared language and understanding of each other’s industries;

•  A lack of technical skills and knowledge which could undermine a cultural
organisation’s standing with the tech sector;

•  An imbalance of funding and skills between culture and tech organisations leading to
an imbalance of control in the relationship and

•  A lack of understanding of intellectual property and tech business models from the
cultural organisation side.

However, effective partnerships present an opportunity for both sectors. For cultural 
organisations, these relationships can offer access to digital talent, space, equipment 
and resources, funding, peer to peer learning opportunities and exposure to new 
ways of working. Tech companies benefit from access to creative minds and creative 
content, and by working on innovative creative projects can explore the limits of their 
technologies capabilities far more than conventional consumer testing would allow. 
Through the Digital Culture Network, Arts Council England will provide a framework for 
cultural and tech organisations to drive partnership working.

Our Approach

Born out of the Culture White Paper124, the Digital Culture Project was launched in 
April 2017 to explore how culture and technology can work together to drive audience 
engagement, unleash the creative potential of technology and boost the capability of 
cultural organisations. By focusing on the synergies between the culture125 and tech 
sectors – where the UK has dual competitive advantage – this project aims to further 
drive our cultural sector’s global status and the engagement and well being of audiences. 

In developing the Digital Culture Project, we have focused on three core themes:

•  Audiences: audience engagement and interaction with culture through digital
platforms and distribution channels;

•  Skills: the digital skills and capability that cultural organisations need to deliver their
cultural offering and operations.

•  Content: covering both the digitisation of existing content and collections and the
creation of ‘born digital’ content where digital technology is used to create new art
and cultural experiences;

The Digital Culture project team was supported by five industry experts who brought 
their knowledge and expertise to the project, providing narrative and evidence on 
specific workstreams.

of the world’s leading countries for digitised collections and using technology to enhance the online 
experience of users’

125  For the purposes of this project, we have defined cultural organisations as those from the performing 
arts, visual arts, heritage, museums, archives, libraries, film and making connections with the wider 
creative industries.

The project team carried out extensive stakeholder consultation, including discussions 
with more than 150 organisations from across the cultural sector, from major national 
institutions to local arts charities, as well as large digital companies and tech start 
ups. Engagement was through bilateral discussions, ministerial roundtables, a horizon 
scanning event and an online consultation platform where over 300 stakeholders gave 
us their views, providing detailed evidence and case studies to inform our thinking.

Thanks go to all those individuals and organisations who contributed to this project, 
sharing both their time and knowledge. The valuable insights provided have helped to 
shape the narrative and policy commitments in this document.
