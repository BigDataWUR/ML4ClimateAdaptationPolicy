Parliament on the Application of Protocols 19 and 21 to the 
Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the 
Functioning of the Union (TFEU) in Relation to EU Justice and 
Home Affairs (JHA) Matters  


  

The JHA Opt-in Protocol and Schengen Opt-out Protocol  

The UK’s participation in EU JHA measures is principally governed by Protocols 19 
(Schengen opt-out) and 21 (JHA opt-in) to the TEU and the TFEU, which allow the 
UK to choose whether to participate in such measures. A decision to opt into a new 
legislative proposal under Protocol 21 must be communicated in writing to the 
President of the Council within three months of the date on which the final language 
version of the proposal is published by the Council. The Government does not, 
however, need to inform the Council if it decides not to opt into a legislative proposal. 
Where the proposed measure builds on part of the Schengen acquis in which the UK 
participates, the UK has three months to opt out and, again, notify the President of 
the Council of that decision.  

The Sixth Report covers decisions taken under the two protocols over the period 
1 December 2014 – 30 November 2015. The Seventh Report covers decisions taken 
under the two protocols over the period 1 December 2015 – 30 November 2016. 
Both reports include decisions made by both this Government and previous 
governments.  

Government commitments on Parliamentary scrutiny of the JHA Opt-in  

On 9 June 2008, Baroness Ashton, then Leader of the House of Lords, outlined in a 
Written Ministerial Statement (WMS) various commitments to enhance Parliamentary 
scrutiny of JHA opt-in decisions. This also included the commitment to provide an 
annual report on decisions made in relation to the JHA opt-in under Protocol 21 and 
Schengen opt-out under Protocol 19. Both Protocols give the UK the right to choose 
whether or not to participate in certain JHA new measures.  


 

The first annual report to Parliament on the Application of Protocols 19 and 21 to the 
Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union 
(TFEU) in relation to EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) matters was submitted in 
January 2011. This covered the period 1 December 2009 to 30 November 2010. The 
second, third, fourth and fifth annual reports were submitted in January 2012, April 
2013, January 2014 and February 2015 respectively. These reports were each 
preceded by a mid-year update.  


 

In his WMS on 20 January 2011, the Minister for Europe outlined the Coalition 
Government’s intention to continue to honour the commitments made by Baroness 
Ashton and to further strengthen Parliamentary scrutiny of JHA opt-in decisions. This 
included a commitment to deposit a WMS in Parliament on all opt-in decisions or to 
make an oral statement where appropriate and necessary; reiterated the existing 
right of the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee and House of Lords 
European Union Select Committee (‘the Committees’) to call a debate on an 
amendable motion on any opt-in decision; and, where there is strong Parliamentary 
interest, the Government expressed its willingness to set aside Government time for 


7  


a debate in both Houses on its proposed approach (a “Lidington debate”). All of these 
commitments apply equally to the Schengen Opt-out Protocol. 


 

Where the UK has not opted in within the initial three month window, it is open to the 
Government to indicate its wish to be bound by measures after they have been 
adopted by the participating Member States.  In such cases it will inform the 
Committees of its intention to do so. The Committees will have an opportunity to offer 
views on this. The Government will also consider offering a debate on Government 
time on a post adoption opt-in decision if it is likely to attract significant Parliamentary 
interest. 


 

Code of Practice  


 

Baroness Ashton’s statement also included a commitment to produce a Code of 
Practice setting out the Government’s commitment to effective scrutiny of opt-in 
decisions. The Code, which includes the commitments the Government made in 
January 2011 to further enhance scrutiny arrangements, was published in May 2013 
and has now been included in the cross-Government scrutiny guidance and is also 
available on the JHA opt-in webpage at: 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jha-opt-in-and-schengen-opt-out-
protocols--3  


 

Sixth Report - JHA opt-in decisions and Schengen opt-out decisions from the 
period 1 December 2014 – 30 November 2015 


 

The table in the Annex A presents all JHA opt-in decisions and Schengen opt-out 
decisions taken from 1 December 2014 until 30 November 2015. 


 

In that period, the two governments have taken decisions on UK participation in 23 
EU JHA legislative proposals.  The UK has decided to opt in under the JHA opt-in 
Protocol in 11 cases and has decided not to opt in in 13 cases (this includes one 
decision on an international agreement where the UK opted into one set of JHA 
provisions in the measure, and did not opt into another). The Government has not 
asserted the Schengen opt-out to any proposals during that period. 


 

It is worth noting that the lead on these proposals falls to a wide range of 
Departments. 


 

Key opt-in decisions made by the Government  


 

Decisions of particular prominence in this period included Council Decisions on the 
signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Council of Europe Convention on 
the Prevention of Terrorism and its Additional Protocol, and Council Decisions 
establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection – one for the 
benefit of Greece and Italy, and another for the benefit of Greece, Italy and Hungary.  


 

The Commission proposed Council Decisions on the signing, on behalf of the 
European Union, of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of 
Terrorism and its Additional Protocol. These Decisions authorised the EU to sign 
the Convention, which requires acceding states to criminalise various terrorism-
related activities under their domestic laws, and its Additional Protocol, which aims to 
set a minimum standard for criminalisation of recruitment to and receipt of training for 
terrorism and the act of travelling abroad for the purpose of terrorism. While the 
Government considers that there is value in ratifying the Convention and its 

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jha-opt-in-and-schengen-opt-out-protocols--3
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jha-opt-in-and-schengen-opt-out-protocols--3


8  

Additional Protocol, it considers that this is a matter for Member States. Therefore the 
Government did not opt into these proposals and has signed both the Convention 
and the Additional Protocol in its own right.  


 

The Commission proposed Council Decisions establishing provisional measures 
in the area of international protection – one for the benefit of Greece and Italy; 
and another for the benefit of Greece, Italy and Hungary. These Decisions 
introduced temporary distribution schemes for persons in clear need of international 
protection to relieve pressure on the asylum systems of Italy, Greece and Hungary as 
frontline Member States, while the EU is facing increased migratory pressures. The 
Government does not support relocation as it is the wrong response to the migratory 
pressures the EU faces - it undermines the important principle that asylum should be 
claimed in the first safe country and does not address the causes of illegal migration.  
Therefore the Government did not opt in to these proposals. 


  

Seventh Report - JHA opt-in decisions and Schengen opt-out decisions from 
the period 1 December 2015 – 30 November 2016 


 

The table in the Annex B presents all JHA opt-in decisions and Schengen opt-out 
decisions taken from 1 December 2015 until 30 November 2016. 


 

In that period, decisions have been taken on UK participation in 36 EU JHA 
legislative proposals.  The UK has decided to opt in under the JHA opt-in Protocol in 
12 cases and has decided not to opt in in 24 cases. The Government has not 
asserted the Schengen opt-out to any proposals during that period. These opt-in 
decisions are without prejudice to discussions on the UK’s future relationship with the 
EU. The UK’s relationship with the EU will change as a result of leaving the EU, 
however, the UK retains the rights and obligations of membership of the EU whilst we 
remain a member. 


 

Key opt-in decisions made by the Government  


 

Decisions of particular prominence last year included: 
• Proposal for a Directive on combating terrorism – the proposal intended to 

set minimum standards for criminalising certain acts as terrorist offences. The 
Government supports Member States complying with their international 
obligations in this area, but UK legislation was already substantially compliant 
with the proposals, and the Government was opposed to being limited in our 
ability to act independently in the counter-terrorism field in the future. The 
Government therefore decided not to opt in.  

• Proposal for a Directive as regards the exchange of information on third 
country nationals and as regards the European Criminal Record 
Information System (ECRIS). ECRIS allows UK law enforcement agencies to 
seek the previous convictions of EU nationals involved in an investigation or 
prosecution. This proposal seeks to develop ECRIS in relation to third country 
nationals, and to link fingerprints to criminal convictions so criminals cannot hide 
their identity. The Government decided to opt in to expand the information law 
enforcement can access about foreign nationals who have offended in the UK.  

• Proposal for a Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for 
determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for 
international protection (Dublin IV) and proposal for a Regulation on the 
European Union Asylum Agency (EUAA). The proposed Dublin IV Regulation 
aims to govern the process of deciding which member state is responsible for 


9  


deciding an asylum claim and streamline the transfer process. The Regulation 
also binds member states to participate in a quota based distribution system. 
The Government does not support relocation as we believe it is the wrong 
response to the migratory pressures the EU faces. It undermines the important 
principle that asylum should be claimed in the first safe country in the region and 
does not address the causes of illegal migration. Where protection cannot be 
provided in the region of origin, we believe resettlement direct from the region is 
the right approach. The proposed EUAA would replace the existing European 
Asylum Support Office and aim to promote the implementation and functioning of 
the Common European Asylum System. The Government considers that the 
functioning of the asylum system is a sovereign matter. The Government did not 
opt in to either measure.  

• Proposal for a Regulation on the establishment of EURODAC for the 
comparison of fingerprints for identifying an illegally staying third-country 
national or stateless person (recast). This Regulation will govern the operation 
of the EURODAC fingerprint database. EURODAC will be expanded to increase 
the categories of fingerprints recorded, to record facial images and biographical 
data, to increase the length of time data can be stored and to provide better data 
sharing procedures between Member States. These changes will strengthen the 
UK’s ability to control illegal migration, prevent multiple asylum applications 
across member States, and protect the UK’s security through data sharing with 
law enforcement agencies. The Government therefore decided to opt in to this 
measure.  

• Regulation on the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement 
Cooperation (EUROPOL). The UK did not opt in when the proposal was first 
published because of concerns that the draft Regulation (1) would have 
interfered with the operational independence of UK policing; and (2) that it would 
have increased the UK’s obligation to provide data to Europol, even where such 
provision would conflict with national security, or endanger ongoing 
investigations or an individual’s safety.  The new Europol Regulation was 
adopted on 11 May 2016. The final agreed text addresses these concerns. The 
Government values the role of Europol in helping UK law enforcement 
coordinate cross border organised crime investigations. The Government made 
a request to the Commission on 16 December 2016 for the UK to participate in 
this Regulation. The Commission adopted a Decision on 6 March 2017 
confirming the UK’s participation in the Regulation. The Regulation will come into 
force on 1 May 2017. 

• Proposal for the recast of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 
November 2003 (the Brussels IIa Regulation) concerning jurisdiction and 
the recognition and enforcement of judgments concerning jurisdiction and 
the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and 
the matters of parental responsibility. The UK decided to opt in to this 
proposal because the UK already applies the current Regulation to the benefit of 
UK citizens, including children, in cross-border families, and the Government 
wanted to avoid the risk that, if the new Regulation comes into force before the 
UK’s EU exit, the existing Regulation would no longer apply to the UK because it 
might be deemed inoperable. Secondly, even after a UK exit the Regulation will 
affect UK citizens, principally in other Member States, and it is in the UK’s 
interests to influence the negotiations. As a family justice measure, this proposal 
must be agreed by unanimity in the Council.

Member States to ratify, 
in the interest of the 
European Union, the 
Protocol of 2014 to the 
Forced Labour 
Convention, 1930, of the 
International Labour 
Organisation with regard 
to matters related to 
judicial co-operation in

Date of Publication (last

12/09/2014 The Commission proposed that Council Decisions should be 
adopted to authorise Member States to ratify a Protocol to the ILO 
Forced Labour Convention, in the interest of the European Union, 
with regard to matters related to judicial cooperation in criminal 
matters and with regard to matters related to social policy. The 
Commission considered that the EU had exclusive competence on 
the basis of existing EU legislation in the area covered by the 
Protocol. The Commission consider that where there is exclusive 
EU competence arising from underlying legislation, and where the 
UK participates in the underlying legislation, the UK's JHA opt-in 
does not apply. 


 

The Coalition Government did not agree that the EU has any 
exclusive competence in the area covered by the Protocol. While 
there are existing EU minimum standards measures in this area, 
minimum standards are not common rules and are therefore 
incapable of generating exclusive external EU competence in 
accordance with Article 3(2) TFEU.  The Coalition Government 
accepted that there is shared competence in this area and it is 
therefore for the Council to decide whether to authorise Member 
States to sign on behalf of the EU. The Coalition Government 
considered that EU action was unnecessary and therefore decided 
not to opt in to the Council Decision covering matters related to 
judicial co-operation.

2 Title Proposal for a Council 
Decision authorising 
Austria, Belgium and 
Poland to ratify, or 
accede to, the Budapest 
Convention on the 
Contract for the 
Carriage of Goods by 
Inland Waterways 
(CMNI) 

Date of Publication (last

18/12/2014 The Commission considered that the EU had exclusive competence 
on the basis of existing EU legislation in the area covered by the 
Protocol. The Commission consider that where there is exclusive 
EU competence arising from underlying legislation, and where the 
UK participates in the underlying legislation, the UK's JHA opt-in 
does not apply. The Coalition Government's view was that where a 
new proposal is made pursuant to Title V, the UK's opt-in is 
triggered. The UK sought an amendment to the relevant wording of 
a recital in the proposed Council Decision to ensure it did not 
preclude our right to opt-in. 


 

The UK is not a party to the Budapest Convention and has no 
cross-border exchange of goods within EU inland waterways. The 
UK had previously indicated, as had the Republic of Ireland, that 
there is no commercial carriage of goods by inland waterways 
between the two and so there is no impact on the UK. Nonetheless, 
it was thought that this was an important legal instrument for those 
Member States that do have cross-border exchange of goods within 
EU inland waterways, since it provides a mechanism for resolving 
conflicts of law in relation to the contracts associated with the 
carriage of goods. The provisions were not expected to have any 
impact on UK businesses or operations involving contracts for the 
carriage of goods by inland waterways, and there were no effects 
on relations with the three Member States seeking authorisation. 
Therefore, the Coalition Government decided to opt-in. The Justice 
and Home Affairs Council met on 15-16 June 2015 and adopted the 
Proposal without including an amendment to the recital language, 
and the Government therefore laid a Minute Statement in order to

3 Title Proposal for a

In December 2014, as part of its REFIT Programme, the 
Commission proposed the repeal of 24 pre-Lisbon police and 
criminal justice measures contained within three separate 
proposals. The repeal of these 24 measures had no practical 
impact on the UK as they either never applied to the UK or the UK 
opted out of them as part of the 2014 JHA opt-out decision on 1 
December 2014. The UK's JHA opt-in was not therefore triggered. 
In February 2015, the Latvian Presidency circulated revised drafts 
of the three proposals which contained suggested amendments. 
Amendments to one document, 16334/14, related to the inclusion of 
the European Evidence Warrant (EEW) in REFIT, and the inclusion 
of text inviting the UK to assert our opt-in under Protocol 21 of the 
TFEU (the JHA opt-in Protocol). The Coalition Government 
considered that these amendments triggered the opt-in. Whilst the 
Coalition Government considered that the EEW had been repealed 
for the UK by way of it's Lisbonisation through the adoption of the 
European Investigation Order (EIO), the Coalition Government 
decided to opt into this Regulation in order to put beyond doubt that 
the EEW does not apply as between the UK and Ireland.

17/02/2015 The proposed Regulation consolidated existing EU legislation; it did 
not contain any new material and did not change the existing 
measures in substance. Although the proposal did not cite a legal 
base in Title V TFEU, and the Government was unsuccessful in 
seeking citation of one, the Government considered that there were 
Justice and Home Affairs obligations in Article 4 and 6 of the draft 
EU Regulation, which triggered the UK's opt-in. Article 4 prevents 
certain judgments from outside the EU being recognised and 
enforced within the EU. Article 6 provides that the Brussels I 
(recast) Regulation applies to proceedings brought under that 
Article to recover damages.  


 

As the UK is already compliant with these rules, and the new 
proposal would not create any additional impacts on the UK, the 
Government chose to opt in.

the Manipulation of Sports Competitions according to national 
needs, and in particular to preserve the ability to exercise the right 
of derogation under Article 19 of the Convention. Article 19 requires 
the Parties to make certain offences extraterritorial, but allows the 
Parties (including the EU) to declare that they reserve the right not 
to apply, or to apply only in specific cases or conditions, the 
requirement for extraterritorial jurisdiction. Presently UK law does 
not apply extraterritorial jurisdiction to all the offences on which we 
would rely for compliance with the Convention and the current 
position is that the UK would be making a declaration reserving the 
right not to assume extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of some of 
the required offences upon signature of the Convention.  The UK's 
right to derogate could be limited if it opted in, should the EU 
exercise its competence in this area.

Convention on the 
Prevention of Terrorism 

Date of Publication (last

13/03/2015 The Commission proposed this Council Decision on the basis that, 
in their view, the EU had exclusive external competence in the area 
covered by the Additional Protocol, arising primarily from the 
Framework Decisions on Combating Terrorism. The UK and a 
number of other Member States objected to the assertion of 
exclusive EU competence on the basis that substantive criminal law 
(including in relation to CT measures) is not harmonised at EU-level 
nor is it largely covered by common rules.  While there are existing 
EU minimum standards measures in this area, minimum standards 
are not common rules and are therefore incapable of generating

TFEU.  The Coalition Government accepted that there is shared 
competence in this area and it is therefore for the Council to decide 
whether to authorise the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the 
EU.  In order to secure agreement within the short deadline, the 
Council Decision was adopted without defining the EU competence 
in relation to the Council of Europe Additional Protocol.  


 

The Council Decision was proposed by the Commission without 
citing a substantive legal base. The Council, in accordance with 
standard practice, added a substantive legal base to the measure 
before negotiations commenced, choosing a Title V TFEU legal 
base, thereby clarifying that the UK's JHA opt-in applies. 


 

Under the 2014 Protocol 36 decision, the UK opted out of the two 
Framework Decisions on combating terrorism.  Therefore the UK is 
not bound by the EU acquis on which the Commission primarily 
based its assertion of EU competence. Not opting in to this Decision 
means that the UK was able to negotiate the Additional Protocol in 
our own right, and confirms that the UK is not bound by EU 
competence, exclusive or otherwise, in this area. 


 

The UK has noted concerns about our three month opt-in period not 
being respected in this case, but accepts that in this case the 
Decision was negotiated quickly to avoid any delay to the Council of 
Europe’s timetable for their response to the recent terrorist attacks 
in Paris.

The opt-in was triggered by incidental provisions on judicial 
cooperation in Article 18(2) of the agreement, because there is 
exclusive EU external competence for certain of the Hague 
Conventions covered by that Article. The Government chose not to 
opt into these provisions given that the practical value to the UK of 
doing so had not been demonstrated.  


 

The Government was unable  to secure the addition of a Title V 
legal base to reflect the inclusion of JHA content, or a recital to 
reflect the UK's position, and laid a minute statement on adoption to 
assert the application of the JHA opt-in.

22/04/2015 When the Commission first proposed the Decision on Croatia’s 
accession to the Agreement in 2013, it suggested that the legal 
basis should be brought in line with the Lisbon Treaty by citing 
Articles 207 and 352. The European Parliament subsequently 
suggested that the correct legal base should be Article 212, rather 
than 352, as the underlying 2002 Agreement relates specifically to

economic cooperation with third countries other than developing 
countries. This suggestion was accepted by the Commission, which 
noted that Article 207 TFEU was the appropriate substantive legal 
basis for Title I of the Agreement, on ‘Customs union’, and that 
Article 212 TFEU the appropriate substantive legal basis for Title II 
on ‘Cooperation’. 


 

The Commission also suggested that the social security provisions 
in the original Agreement introduced rights for third country 
nationals under the Union’s immigration policy.  As such, it 
considered Article 79(2)(b) to be the appropriate substantive legal 
basis to account for the Title III, on ‘Social Provisions’. The 
Commission therefore issued an amended proposal on 22 April 
2015, which included a legal basis of Article 79, Article 207 and 
Article 212.  


 

Since the UK is already bound by the underlying Agreement, and 
this Decision simply allows Croatia to accede to it, the proposal 
would have no impact on the UK. However, we accept that there 
are JHA implications for Croatia and therefore support the inclusion 
of a Title V legal base. The Government decided to opt into the 
Decision.

04/05/2015 The JHA opt-in was triggered by incidental provisions on both Mode 
IV and readmissions.  


 

The Mode IV provisions were in line with the UK’s previously-
agreed commitments under the WTO General Agreement on Trade 
in Services (GATS) and as such the Government took the decision 
to opt in. 


 

On readmissions, consideration was given to whether the UK 
wanted to be bound by an exercise of EU competence in relation to 
this area with Kosovo, which might limit the UK’s ability to maintain 
its existing, effective readmission arrangements. As such a decision 
was made not to opt in as the Government judged that the 
provisions in the SAA, or a future readmissions agreement, would 
not be an improvement on the effective readmission arrangements 
UK already have with Kosovo. 


 

The Council Decisions were proposed without a Title V legal base. 
The Government pressed consistently for this, and for the Decisions 
to clarify that the UK’s opt-in is engaged, but there was not 
sufficient support in Council to secure one.  


 

However, the Government did secure an amendment to the Council 
Decision acknowledging that the Agreement contains provisions 
relating to JHA, as well as a recital in the SAA text itself clarifying 
that the opt-in would apply to JHA measures in any future 
agreements which could be made based on the Kosovo SAA. When 
the Council Decisions were adopted on 22 October 2015, the UK 
laid a minute statement placing our position on record.

The Government does not believe that there is any exclusive EU

exercise shared competence in respect of the provisions. It 
therefore did not opt into the Decision.

Date of Publication (last

18/05/2015 The Council Decision was proposed by the Commission with an 
Article 218(3) and (4) TFEU procedural legal base as the 
Commission do not consider that substantive legal bases are 
required for negotiating mandates. The Council, consistent with 
previous decisions, agreed that a substantive legal base was 
required and cited Articles 82 and 87 TFEU. Articles 82 and 87 
TFEU are consistent with the legal bases used for previous PNR 
agreements with third countries (e.g. US, Australia and Canada). 
The agreement would allow the processing of PNR data by the 
Mexican Competent Authority. Mexico had approached UK and 
other European carriers to require their PNR data.  This puts any 
EU carrier in a conflicted position; if it provides a passenger’s PNR, 
it potentially breaches European Data Protection legislation by 
transferring the data outside the EU without there being adequate 
safeguards in place; however failure to transfer the data could result 
in significant financial penalties under Mexican law.  The purpose of 
the agreement is to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for 
processing of the data for the law enforcement purposes outlined 
above. Analysis of this data assists law enforcement agencies to

EU undertaking negotiations with Mexico with the aim of concluding 
the agreement.  As the Mexican Government set a deadline of 1 
July for the opening of negotiations on a PNR agreement, the UK's 
three month opt-in window was shortened. The Government did not 
press for the three month window to be respected in this case 
because of the external driver for the negotiating mandate to be 
adopted.

16/06/2015 The Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism

The UK has signed the Convention and is intending to ratify the 
Convention. The UK is compliant with the requirements of the 
Convention. While we consider that there is value in ratifying the 
Convention, and confirming our support for international legislation 
supporting efforts to tackle the terrorist threat, we consider that this

No the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in 
accordance with Protocol No 21 on the position of the UK and

annexed to the TFEU, the UK’s JHA opt-in applies. On adoption of 
the Decision, the UK laid a minute statement setting out its position. 


 

The Government took the view in this instance that UK interests 
would be best served by opting into the proposed Decision, as this 
would retain the UK’s ability to fully ratify the HNS Protocol, and the 
removal of any binding deadline from the proposal has the effect of 
maintaining the UK’s current flexibility to be able to ratify and 
accede to the HNS Protocol if and when we are ready to do so.

29/06/2015 The UK did not opt in to the proposed Council Decision authorising 
the opening of negotiations with the Associated States (Norway, 
Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) and Denmark concerning 
access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes. This proposal 
concerns the opening of negotiations. If the negotiations are 
successful there will be a further Council Decision, also subject to 
the United Kingdom’s Justice and Home Affairs opt-in. At this point 
we will be able to assess properly any potential benefits to the UK 
and others, and on that basis consider whether or not to opt in.  


 

The initial proposal for a Council Decision from the Commission  in 
line with the Commission's general practice in relation to negotiating 
mandate Council Decisions, cited only a procedural legal base. The 
position of the Council is to add in a substantive legal base into the 
Council Decision, in this case from Title V of Part III of the Treaty on 
the Functioning of the European Union. The citation of a Title V 
provides legal certainty that the JHA opt-in applies. In this case, a 
Title V legal base was not added. The UK therefore laid a minute 
statement on adoption confirming its opt in position.

Date of Publication (last

01/07/2015 The Government has supported the accession of Kazakhstan to the 
WTO on the right terms.  In acceding to the WTO, Kazakhstan will 
embrace a series of rules and commitments which form the 
foundation of an open, transparent and non-discriminatory global 
trading system and which will provide important guarantees for 
them and for the other WTO Members.  Accession to the WTO will 
bring Kazakhstan more firmly into the global economy and make 
Kazakhstan a more attractive place to do business, and it will help 
to achieve the Government’s trade policy objective of expanding the 
WTO’s membership.  


 

The JHA opt-in was triggered by incidental Mode IV provisions, 
relating to the temporary movement of natural persons for business. 
These provisions are in line with the UK’s previously-agreed Mode 
IV commitments under the WTO General Agreement on Trade in

decided to opt into the provisions.

position to be adopted, 
on behalf of the 
European Union, in the 
sixty-sixth session of the 
Executive Committee of 
the Programme of the 
United Nations High 
Commissioner for 
Refugees 

Date of Publication (last 
language version) 

30/09/2015 At the Economic and Finance Council on 6 October 2015, EU 
Finance Ministers agreed by Council Decision to support a change 
to the rules of procedure of the Executive Committee of the United 
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) which would 
enable enhanced participation of the EU in private meetings. 


 

The Council Decision commits EU Member States to support an 
extension of the EU's observer status at the Executive Committee 
to include meetings discussing UNHCR budgeting and 
programming. The EU would be able to attend those meetings, but 
it would retain its observer status and would still not have a formal 
vote. 


 

Usually a Foreign Affairs Council matter, this was put to the 
Economic and Finance Council so that it could be adopted before 
the end of the UNHCR Executive Committee annual meeting in 
Geneva from 5th to 9th October. In fact, the EU proposal was not 
raised as part of the agenda, so the rule was not, in the end, 
amended by the Committee.   


 

The Council Decision was adopted by QMV. The UK Government 
was not afforded time to undertake our Parliamentary and internal 
obligations in relation to taking an opt-in decision, and therefore did 
not take part in the adoption of the Council Decision, and will not be 
bound by it. No override was required.

Decision on the EU 
position on the 
Accession to Liberia 
World Trade

Date of Publication (last

02/10/2015 The UK supports the accession of all candidate WTO accession 
countries as long as it takes place on the right terms and at a time 
that is right for the candidates to meet the commitments of WTO 
membership. The Government considers that this is the case for 
Liberia. 


 

Liberia will be able to benefit from WTO market access, global 
trading rules and the transparency of the WTO trading system. It 
will also be able to use the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism. 
Their membership of the WTO will mean that foreign businesses, 
including those of the UK, will be operating in a more transparent 
and predictable business environment.  This will also send a 
broader positive signal to the wider developing world, with an 
African LDC acceding to the WTO at the first Ministerial Conference 
to be held in Africa. It will also help to achieve the Government’s 
trade policy objective of expanding the WTO’s membership.  


 

The JHA opt-in was triggered by incidental Mode IV provisions,

23/10/2015 The European Commission had proposed to make notifications to 
the World Trade Organisation without a decision in Council. The 
UK, along with other member states, ensured that the decision was 
under the correct legal bases and proceeded as a double decision 
to respect member state competence.  


 

The JHA opt-in was triggered by incidental Mode IV provisions, 
relating to the temporary movement of natural persons for business.  


 

The Government decided to opt in to the provisions due to the 
benefits of this policy (i) for LDCs, providing new opportunities for 
economic development and increased exports, in line with DFID's 
priorities; (ii) for the UK, with increased access to  services 
suppliers (we expect the impact on the UK to be positive but small); 
and (iii) as a vital component of negotiations at the WTO; this 
notification is essential to demonstrate delivery of an agreement in 
the last WTO Ministerial in 2013 and to assist negotiations in the 
Ministerial in December 2015.

the relocation of individuals in need of international protection 
between EU Member States which were agreed during Summer 
2015.  


 

Implementation of these was extremely slow with only around 160 
people relocated from Italy and Greece when the Government 
informed Parliament of its opt-in decision to this measure in 
December 2015. Negotiations on a permanent relocation 
mechanism have also proved long and difficult and reinforced the 
Government's view that relocation is the wrong response to the 
crisis and that the time and effort devoted to negotiating these 
measures would have been far better spent on implementing 
practical solutions to secure the external border and provide 
sustainable protection in the region, a position which the UK has 
been calling for since the beginning of the crisis.

Jordan is not an immigration returns priority for the UK (there were 
only four enforced returns from January to September 2015), and 
our returns process is excellent; Jordan is a country to which we 
return on EU Letters (this is easier because we do not need to 
obtain a travel document if we have strong supporting evidence of 
nationality).  We would not enjoy an operational advantage if we 
were to change our bilateral arrangements for conducting returns to 
Jordan.

information can be shared between competent authorities across 
the EU. As the provision requires cooperation involving law 
enforcement bodies, the Government believes these are JHA 
obligations and therefore our JHA opt-in is triggered and we have 
informed Council of that fact.

5 Title Proposal for a 
Regulation of the 
European Parliament 
and of the Council on 
the protection of the 
individual with regard to 
the processing of 
personal data and on 
the free movement of 
such data 

Date of Publication (last 
language) 

17/12/2015 This Government decided not to opt in to the Justice and Home 
Affairs provision within the EU general data protection regulation 
(GDPR). Negotiations on the regulation were concluded on 15 
December 2015 and a proposed final compromise text was 
communicated to the European Council on 17 December. The 
GDPR was adopted in April 2016. 


 

The compromise text published at the end of triologue negotiations 
on 17 December 2015 was the first formal text that contained 
wording in Article 43a, which triggers the UK’s opt-in under protocol 
21. This article deals with the recognition and enforcement of 
judgments, and includes content that falls under article 81 (judicial 
co-operation in civil matters) and article 82 (judicial co-operation in 
criminal matters) Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 
thereby triggering the UK’s JHA opt-in. The text restricts a member 
state from enforcing a judgment requiring the transfer or disclosure 
of personal data where there is no international agreement or 
treaty. 


 

As a result of concerns relating to the integrity of the UK legal 
system, the UK did not opt-in to the parts of Article 43a which 
triggered Protocol 21. Due to the late introduction of the JHA 
content into the text, it was not possible in this case to complete the 
normal scrutiny procedures.

Although EFCA has no law enforcement role itself, the proposal 
would, nonetheless, formally establish co-operation and exchange 
of information between this agency and national authorities 
intended for the prevention, detection, and investigation of criminal 
offences, including the trafficking of humans, weapons and drugs as 
well as for migration control. The effect of the measure would then 
amount to co-operation that falls within the scope of the Justice and 
Home Affairs section of the EU Treaties, because EFCA would then 
be expected to facilitate the exchange and sharing of such 
information for purposes beyond its current role. 
                                
Despite making the case for an additional Title V legal base in the 
proposal, given the Government’s view that a substantial proportion 
of the proposal relates to support and information exchange for 
border control and law enforcement functions, the UK received no 
support from other Member States or from the Commission on this 
request as they felt that the JHA content and aim of the proposal 
was too small to justify a joint legal base. As a result, whilst the 
Government still considered that there was a case for such a legal 
base and that the proposal contained JHA content, it decided to not 
opt in to this proposal.

No well as for migration control. The effect of the measure would then 
amount to co-operation that falls within the scope of the Justice and

then be expected to facilitate the exchange and sharing of such 
information for purposes beyond its current role. 


 

The amendments in the proposed Regulation would also allow the 
Commission to make recommendations for cooperation at national, 
EU and international level. As the information collected by EMSA 
would be shared for justice and home affairs purposes falling within 
Articles 77(2)(d) and 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union, the Government considered that the Justice and 
Home Affairs opt-in applied. Despite making the case for an 
additional Title V legal base in the proposal, given the 
Government’s view that a substantial proportion of the proposal 
relates to support and information exchange for border control and 
law enforcement functions information sharing amongst Member 
States had Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) implications, the UK 
received no support from other Member States or from the

8 Title Proposal for a Directive 
of the European 
Parliament and of the 
Council on combating 
terrorism to replace 
Council Framework 
Decision 2002/475/JHA 
on combating terrorism 

Date of Publication (last 
language) 

20/12/2015 The draft EU Directive on Combating Terrorism is intended to 
replace the 2002 Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism 
(2002/475/JHA), as amended in 2008.  The draft measure seeks to 
ensure that Member States are compliant with international 
obligations by setting minimum standards across the EU for 
criminalising certain acts as terrorist offences within national law.  


 

The UK’s domestic legislation is compliant with international 
obligations in this area, specifically the UN Security Council 
Resolution 2178 and the Council of Europe Additional Protocol to 
the 2005 Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.

EUC: Did a debate take N/A

place? Therefore UK legislation is already substantially compliant with the 
proposals in the draft Directive and furthermore, the Government is 
clear that we should not do anything which could bind us to an 
exercise of EU competence, or which could limit our ability to act 
independently in the counter-terrorism legislation field in the future. 
The previous Government also opted out of the 2002 Framework 
Decision (as amended) in December 2014 as part of the block opt 
out from a number of police and judicial co-operation measures.   


 

The Government therefore decided not to opt in to the draft 
Directive, nor would it opt-in to the proposal post-adoption. This 
decision does not affect the Government’s broad support for 
ensuring all Member States are compliant with their international 
obligations in this area. Nor does this decision change the 
importance that the UK Government attaches to collaborative 
international efforts to combat the threat from foreign fighters. The 
UK continues to, co-operate with EU Member States and 
international organisations to support our international partners in 
this area and to shape the strategic approach to counter-terrorism 
internationally.

21/12/2015 The Council Decision seeks to agree the Union’s position in relation 
to a Recommendation of the Joint Readmission Committee (JRC - 
which consists of the EU and Russia and was set up to consider 
and advise on implementation of the EU-Russia readmission 
agreement (EURA)). The Recommendation sets out timescales for 
Russia and Member States to arrange readmission interviews (for 
the purpose of determining nationality).  


 

The Government did not consider that the planned 
Recommendation of the JRC would have “legal effects” which 
meant that a Council Decision was not appropriate and that a Union 
position on the Recommendation should be agreed via Council 
Conclusions. The Council, however, continued to maintain its 
position that a Council Decision is appropriate.

response to the migratory pressures the EU faces - it undermines 
the important principle that asylum should be claimed in the first 
safe country and does not address the causes of illegal migration.   
The Government has not opted in to any relocation measure so far

document reflects this position. The Immigration Minister informed 
the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees by way of an Explanatory

The proposal requires that where Member States have chosen to 
pursue a criminal sanctions regime for breaches of elements of the 
proposals, those Member States must ensure that information can 
be shared between competent authorities across the EU. As the 
provision requires cooperation involving law enforcement bodies, 
the Government believes these are JHA obligations and therefore 
our JHA opt-in is triggered and we informed Council of that fact. 


 

The Government has decided not to opt in to these provisions as 
there are no significant benefits to be gained from doing so. The 
obligation to share information will fall on Member States who have 
a relevant criminal sanctions regime, and UK competent authorities 
will be in a position to access this data irrespective of the decision 
to opt in. The Government has no intention to introduce a criminal 
sanctions regime in a way that would lead to this Regulation 
imposing an obligation on UK or on our competent authorities.

Date of Publication (last

01/02/2016 The European Commission, keen to demonstrate it is taking action 
on returns, put forward this proposal for a new EU travel document 
for returns (also known as laissez-passer or EU Letter (EUL)). It 
specifically seeks to improve the effective return of third country 
nationals who do not fulfil or no longer fulfil the conditions for entry, 
stay or residence in the Member State of the Union, when those 
third country nationals possess no valid travel documents. 
Currently, as per Council Recommendation of 30 November 1994 
entitled ‘standard travel document for the removal/expulsion of 
third-country foreign nationals’, Member States may issue a 
document (commonly known as a laissez-passer) for illegal third 
country nationals who do not possess a valid travel document which 
this new EU travel document seeks to replace. The Government

N/A decided not to opt in to this new proposal. The UK uses the current 
document successfully. We do not consider that the proposal would 
further improve the process for returning third country nationals who 
are illegally present in the UK given we already use the existing EU 
travel document for returns purposes to a number of countries. 


 

In addition, we considered it unlikely there would be a significant 
impact on the UK’s continued use of the 1994 Recommendation 
‘laissez-passer’. We will continue to use the document as we 
currently do and will expect third countries to do the same as per 
current bilaterally agreed processes. We will rely on existing good 
relations and diplomatic engagement to ensure we can continue as 
per current processes.

25/01/2016 This proposal seeks to develop further the European Criminal 
Records Information System (ECRIS) (which currently is a 
mechanism which allows UK law enforcement agencies to seek the 
previous convictions of EU nationals involved in an investigation or 
prosecution, and the UK is one of the biggest users of the system). 
The proposal seeks to develop ECRIS in relation to third country 
nationals, as well as for fingerprints to be linked to criminal 
convictions (as is the case in the UK) so that criminals could not 
hide their identity. These were developments that the UK pushed 
for. The Government decided to opt in on the basis that 
participation will expand the amount of information our police 
officers can access about foreign nationals who have offended in 
the UK, ensure policing and prosecutions are fully informed, and 
add further weight to the case for individuals to be removed from 
this country under immigration powers.

commercial judgments. The UK is playing a leading part in the 
drafting of a text. At the moment, no comprehensive international 
legal instrument exists, and should the discussions at a Hague 
Conference level be successful, such an instrument will be valuable 
in relation to the recognition and enforcement of judgments to and 
from the UK, both at an EU and international level. It is likely to be 
some years, however, before an agreed text emerges.  


 

The Council Decision refers to the EU negotiating mandate for the 
Special Commissions, as the EU has exclusive external 
competence to negotiate on behalf of EU Member States in this 
area. As the measure cites a Title V legal base, in accordance with 
Protocol No 21, the Government considers that the UK's JHA opt-in 
applies. Given the UK’s support in principle for the aims of the 
Convention and our active involvement in work at The Hague, the 
Government decided to opt in.  


 

As the Commission and Council do not consider that the opt-in 
applies in circumstances where the EU has exclusive external 
competence, the UK laid a minute statement clarifying the 
application of the opt-in.

amending Directive 
96/71/EC of The 
European Parliament 
and of the Council of 16 
December 1996 
concerning the posting 
of workers in the 
framework of the 
provision of services 

Date of Publication (last 
language) 

08/03/2016 A provision (Article 1 of the proposal) states that, for workers who 
are posted for 24 months or longer, the host country is deemed to 
be ‘the country in which his or her work is habitually carried out’. By 
operation of Article 8 of the Rome I Regulation (a JHA civil law 
measure which determines the law applicable to contracts), this 
provision is capable of determining the law which governs the 
employment contract.  


 

The Government therefore considers that as this provision amends 
an existing JHA measure, this constitutes a JHA obligation, and in 
accordance with Article 4(a)(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of 
the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of Freedom, 
Security and Justice annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of 
the European Union, the UK’s opt-in is triggered. The Government 
does not consider that it is in the United Kingdom’s interest to opt in 
to this amendment as the provision is not expected to impact 
workers posted to the UK as our domestic law broadly provides for 
the effect sought by the proposal.

COUNCIL DECISION 
authorising the opening 
of negotiations on an 
agreement between the 
European Union and 
the Federal Republic of 
Nigeria on readmission 

Date of Publication (last 
language) 

31/05/2016 EU readmission agreements (EURAs) ensure reciprocal procedures 
for the identification, documentation and return of persons illegally 
entering or remaining in EU member states, or the third country. We 
decide whether to participate in EURAs on a case-by-case basis, 
depending on the priority we attach to the country concerned in 
terms of numbers of immigration returns and the degree to which 
we enjoy a good bilateral relationship with that country. 


 

A Title V legal base (Article 79(3) TFEU) was added to the Council 
Decision during negotiations, which clarifies that the UK's JHA opt-
in is triggered by this measure. 


 

The Government have decided not to opt in to this Council Decision 
authorising the opening of negotiations on an agreement between 
the European Union and Nigeria on readmission. In terms of returns 
co-operation, the UK already has bilateral arrangements with 
Nigeria via a memorandum of understanding, which work well, for 
example allowing the return of Nigerian nationals. We would not 
envisage an operational advantage if we were to change our 
current bilateral arrangements for conducting returns to Nigeria.

replacing the lists of 
insolvency proceedings

A and B to Regulation 
(EU) 2015/848 on 
insolvency proceedings 

Date of Publication (last 
language) 

02/06/2016 The EU Insolvency Regulation has applied to the UK since 2002 
and provides a legal framework to ensure that an insolvency 
proceeding commenced in a Member State is recognised across 
the EU, without the need to commence separate proceedings in 
other Member States where assets, for example, may be located.  
On 20 May 2015, the Regulation was recast to Regulation (EU) 
2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council (“the 
recast Regulation”). The recast Regulation came into force on 26 
June 2015 and will apply (in the main) from 26 June 2017. The 
2015 Regulation cites a Title V legal base and the UK opted in to 
this Regulation.

amendments will have no impact on the UK and no changes are

Republic of 
Kazakhstan, of the 
other part 

Date of Publication (last 
language) 

08/06/2016 As with the Council Decision on signature of this agreement, the 
UK's JHA opt-in was triggered by incidental Mode IV provisions, 
relating to the temporary movement of natural persons for business, 
which are in line with the UK’s previously-agreed Mode IV 
commitments under the WTO General Agreement on Trade in 
Services (GATS). With this in mind, the Government decided to opt 
into the provisions. 


 

Some bilateral partners, including Kazakhstan, are already seeking 
reassurance about their relationships with the UK throughout the 
UK exit negotiation period and once we have left the EU. Delays to 
the progression of EU Third Country Agreements have the potential 
to damage future prospects for UK bilateral relations with any 
countries affected, including potential future trade agreements. In 
this instance, the Government welcomes and encourages this 
agreement with Kazakhstan. Given the agreement’s value to the 
UK, we see no good reason to delay its progress and application.

13/06/2016 All EU member states are party to the 1980 Hague Convention, the 
primary civil law international instrument which provides a 
mechanism to seek the prompt return of wrongfully removed or 
retained children to their country of habitual residence. 


 

When a country wishes to accede to the Convention, it is necessary 
for an existing contracting state to accept that country’s accession 
before the Convention can apply between them. It is the European 
Commission’s view that there is exclusive competence on the EU 
for all matters relating to the 1980 Convention and that therefore 
member states must be authorised by the EU to accept accessions 
by third countries and must do so collectively through Council 
decisions. 


 

Although not anticipated in the proposals, the Government believe 
that the UK opt-in under Protocol No 21 to the Treaty on the 
Functioning of the European Union applies. The Government has 
asserted its right to choose whether to opt-in and have decided that

the ability to vote. These proposals must be agreed by unanimity 
within the EU Council.

The proposal seeks to increase the EU’s attractiveness to highly

that decisions on who comes to the country are best framed at 
national level in accordance with national assessments of economic 
need. It would also undermine our ability to reduce net migration.

01/07/2013 The Government decided not to opt in to the EU proposal for a 
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the

The proposed European Union Agency for Asylum would replace 
the existing European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The UK 
currently participates in EASO. 


 

The aim of the proposal is an agency with more powers to promote 
the implementation and improve the functioning of the Common 
European Asylum System. The proposal provides the European 
Union Agency for Asylum with a significant degree of oversight over 
national asylum systems. 


 

We are committed to running a high quality and effective asylum 
system but have always taken the view that the functioning of the 
asylum system is a sovereign matter. 


 

The UK will therefore not opt in to the proposal for the EU Agency 
for Asylum.

deem the old Regulation inoperable and it would no longer apply to 
the UK even though the UK was still a Member State. Secondly, 
even after a UK exit the Regulation will affect UK citizens, 
principally in other Member States, and it is in the UK’s interests to 
influence the negotiations. As a family justice measure this proposal

01/08/2016 In line with the Government’s position on the 4th Anti-Money 
Laundering Directive, we considered the proposal to be a partial 
JHA measure. Whilst the amendments did not have a Title V legal 
base, we concluded that the provisions relating to the sharing of 
data from registers between Financial Intelligence Units and law 
enforcement authorities triggered the opt-in.  


 

The Government supports the sharing of information between law 
enforcement agencies and therefore decided to opt in to these 
provisions.

19/08/2016 The Government decided not to opt in to the EU proposal for the 
Dublin IV regulation. 


 

The Regulation will govern the process of deciding which member 
state is responsible for deciding an asylum claim and streamline the 
transfer process. The UK supports those aims, but the proposed 
Dublin IV regulation binds member states to participate in a quota-
based distribution scheme. The proposal also permits the 
Commission to impose considerable financial burdens on member 
states, of €250,000 per applicant not transferred under this 
mechanism.

country they enter and not be moved around the EU using 
allocation quotas. 


 

By not opting in to Dublin IV regulation, the UK remains bound by 
the Dublin III regulation, which will allow the Government to return 
applicants where another member state is responsible for 
determining their asylum claim and discourage secondary

19/08/2016 The Government decided to opt in to the EU proposal for the 
EURODAC III regulation. 


 

The Regulation will govern the operation of the EURODAC 
fingerprint database, which holds the fingerprints of asylum seekers 
and certain illegal entrants to the EU, in order to help member 
states determine who is responsible under the Dublin regulation for 
dealing with an asylum claim and to tackle illegal migration. 


 

The EURODAC database will be expanded to increase the 
categories of fingerprints recorded, to record facial images and 
biographical data, to increase the length of time data can be stored 
to five years and to provide better data-sharing procedures between 
member states. These changes will strengthen the UK’s ability to 
control illegal migration, prevent multiple asylum applications across 
member states and protect the UK’s security through data sharing 
with law enforcement agencies.

reasons for action at EU-level, such as alleviating pressures on 
countries hosting a disproportionate number of displaced 
individuals, gaining influence in policy dialogues with third countries, 
and improving the resettlement process, can equally be achieved 
through close cooperation between international partners operating 
national resettlement schemes. National schemes also allow 
resettlement efforts to be aligned with the domestic and 
international priorities of individual Member States, including 
maintaining full control over the numbers to be resettled. The 
Government therefore decided not to opt in to this proposal.

Proposal for a Regulation 
amending Regulation (EU)

The proposal builds on a previous Commission proposal to 
extend the system for exchanging criminal records between 
Member States (European Criminal Records Information System 
– ECRIS) to cover criminal records on third country nationals. 
This Regulation provides the technical specifications for a 
centralised database to hold criminal record information on third 
country nationals.  


       

The ETIAS system aims to enhance the security of the 
Schengen external border by requiring non-EU nationals, who 
do not require a visa to travel to the Schengen area, to seek 
authorisation to travel. As a Schengen measure, the UK does 
not participate in the ETIAS proposal. The ETIAS proposal 
seeks to require Europol to set up a watchlist for use by the 
ETIAS system. As the Europol Regulation is not a Schengen 
measure, this aspect of the proposal has been split into a 
separate JHA measure to which the JHA opt-in applies.

the Commission believes that a formal mandate is necessary.
