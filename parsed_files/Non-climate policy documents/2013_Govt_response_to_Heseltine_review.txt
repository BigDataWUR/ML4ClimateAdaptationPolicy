Foreword 


 

As the UK continues to recover from the worst economic crisis in generations, this Government 
remains committed to take the bold action necessary to support growth and ensure Britain can 
compete in the global race. 

Lord Heseltine’s compelling report, No Stone Unturned, reviews all parts of government policy 
affecting economic growth, with 89 recommendations challenging all of us – politicians, civil 
servants, business leaders and individuals – to step up and play our part in wealth creation. His report 
is full of important ideas.  

At its heart is a powerful case for decentralising economic powers from central government to local 
areas and leaders, as those best placed to understand and to address the opportunities and obstacles 
to growth in their own communities. The Government agrees with this. Just as strong local 
leadership is what made the UK successful in the past it also has the potential to transform our 
competitiveness in the present.  

The process is already underway. The creation of business-led Local Enterprise Partnerships, greater 
powers and flexibilities for local authorities, the introduction of the Regional Growth Fund, City Deals 
and Enterprise Zones are but some of the measures this Government has taken to empower local 
communities.  

We now need to take the next bold step that will turn the tide on the excessive centralisation that 
shackles local ambition and creativity. This document sets out our ambitious blueprint for unlocking 
the economic potential this country has to offer. 

But Lord Heseltine’s report does not stop there. He presents a comprehensive package of measures 
that, taken together, will transform the environment for business in the UK. And so we are acting 
across the board on his recommendations.  

We are making the changes needed so that right across Whitehall there is a genuine focus on 
growth in policy development and delivery. 

We will step up our engagement with business, working in partnership to develop joint policies for 
growth and develop a long-term vision for the economy. And we are very clear that Britain remains 
open for business, attracting foreign companies that bring in new ideas, technologies and skills, 
stimulate productivity and open new markets for trade. 

We will build on the supply-side reforms that are essential to the UK’s success in the global race, 
cutting the burden of regulation, reforming the planning system and addressing the significant 
under-investment in the UK’s infrastructure. 

And to ensure that future generations leave school and college with the knowledge, skills and 
attitudes that make them ready to succeed in the work place, we heed Lord Heseltine’s calls to 
continue to reform England’s education and skills system to increase employer engagement, 
challenge underperformance and emphasise learning outcomes, to match the world’s best.  

Lord Heseltine has laid down the challenge. This Government is ready to rise to it.

Executive summary 


 

Following a commission from the Prime Minister, Lord Heseltine presented his report No Stone 
Unturned to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and 
Skills on 31 October 2012. Lord Heseltine makes a series of recommendations in all aspects of 
government policy that affect economic growth. The Government welcomes this report. 

This document sets out the Government’s response. The Government confirms that it is 
accepting in full or in part 81of Lord Heseltine’s 89 recommendations to dramatically advance 
the process of decentralisation, unleash the potential of local economies, strengthen 
partnerships with industry and foster economic growth. In five cases the Government has taken 
a different view: this document explains why. Three recommendations on the content of the 
Single Local Growth Fund will be addressed at the Spending Round in June 2013. 

This response builds on the significant action the Government has already taken to reduce the 
deficit, restore economic stability and create the conditions for long-term growth. It 
complements the Government’s ambitious supply side growth agenda set out in the Plan for 
Growth; the Government’s industrial strategy to strengthen partnerships with business; and the 
series of reforms that the Government has pursued in recent Budgets and Autumn Statements. 
Together with the measures set out in this response, the Government has a comprehensive 
economic plan to create a stronger, more balanced economy. 

The core proposition of Lord Heseltine’s report is a decentralised approach that breaks 
Whitehall’s monopoly on resources and decision making, and empowers Local Enterprise 
Partnerships (LEPs) to drive forward growth in their local areas. Alongside this, Lord Heseltine 
makes a number of recommendations that strengthen the underpinnings of long-term growth, 
from changes to the way in which Whitehall supports growth, to strengthening partnerships 
between government and business, and business and education. 

Unleashing local growth – summary of key actions 

The Government is undertaking a radical approach to decentralisation that will give business-led 
LEPs the power to make the choices that are right for their local economies. The Government is: 

• creating a Single Local Growth Fund, allocated through a process of negotiation 
and using competitive tension to strengthen incentives on LEPs and their partners 
to generate growth; 

• asking LEPs to develop new strategic multi-year plans for local growth, which will 
be the basis on which the Government negotiates deals with each LEP for levers, 
resources and the flexibility over them; and 

• streamlining the management of the EU Structural and Investment Funds in 
England and aligning priorities on the basis of the plans led by LEPs. 

Appropriate accountability structures at local and national levels must first be in place to deliver 
this step change and it will be up to local areas to determine which governance structure is right 
for them. The Government is: 

• supporting local authorities that wish to create a combined authority or implement 
other forms of collaboration including conurbation mayors; 


    6  

• assigning a senior Whitehall sponsor to each LEP to carry out high level 
engagement, offer strategic challenge to LEPs, and act as champion for the LEP 
across Whitehall; and 

• as part of this, enhancing the arrangements in place for cross-departmental working 
through the creation of Local Growth Teams, so that senior Whitehall sponsors can 
deploy these resources more effectively in co-ordinated support of LEPs. 

Transforming Whitehall in support of growth – summary of key actions 

All government departments will be departments for growth. The Government is transforming 
Whitehall and its public bodies so that growth is at the forefront of policy development and 
delivery. The Government is:  

• ensuring that all departments have transparent and ambitious growth 
commitments and that the expertise of Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) is harnessed; 

• streamlining public bodies by transferring functions to the local level and the 
private sector where appropriate; 

• forging closer ties between the civil service, businesses and representative bodies to 
obtain the necessary commercial skills to deliver pro-growth policies; and 

• simplifying and standardising the central government procurement framework to 
speed up procurements and drive value for money for the taxpayer. 

Boosting engagement with business – summary of key actions 

Lord Heseltine’s report emphasises the importance of government boosting its engagement with 
business and major sectors of the economy. This is a priority for the Government’s industrial 
strategy, which seeks to strengthen partnerships with business to develop joint policies for 
growth. The Government is: 

• driving forward its industrial strategy by creating industrial strategy partnership 
councils and co-creating strategies in 11 key sectors; 

• forging stronger links with researchers, universities and business to develop, 
support and maintain the UK’s world class knowledge base; and 

• increasing engagement with foreign and domestic investors including through the 
expansion of the Strategic Relationship Management (SRM) programme. 

Creating the conditions for long-term growth – summary of key actions 

The Government’s supply-side reform agenda is essential to the UK’s success in the global race. 
While these reforms are already having an impact, there is room for further ambition in some 
key areas identified by Lord Heseltine. The Government is: 

• implementing a new approach to regulators to improve regulatory enforcement 
and thereby removing unnecessary burdens on business, and lobbying the EU 
Commission to reduce burdensome EU regulation; 

• reforming the planning system to reduce costs and bring speed and certainty to 
business; and 


     7 

• addressing under-investment in the UK’s infrastructure while providing investment 
opportunities to the private sector. 

Fostering private sector growth – summary of key actions 

Lord Heseltine’s report sets out a number of recommendations primarily aimed at encouraging 
businesses to develop and share their capacity for growth. The Government fully endorses this 
and is supporting the private sector to achieve this. The Government is: 

• creating a Business Bank to help address structural gaps in the supply of long-term 
patient capital to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs); 

• recognising the role of trade associations in improving business performance and 
encouraging them to undertake reforms to improve their effectiveness;  

• enhancing the global competitiveness of UK supply chains, encouraging 
departments to learn from best practice in the manufacturing sector; and 

• encouraging business schools to play a greater part in improving the leadership and 
management capability of local businesses. 

Improving employment outcomes from the education and skills system – summary of key actions 

The Government shares Lord Heseltine’s goal of reforming England’s education and skills system 
to match the world’s best, ensuring that young people leave school and college with the 
knowledge, skills and attitudes that make them ready to succeed in work. The Government is: 

• reforming post-16 vocational provision to ensure that students acquire rigorous 
qualifications with a clear progression route to employment or higher education;  

• forging closer links between employers and education providers to ensure students 
develop essential skills for the work-place; 

• challenging underperformance in schools including providing a new role for the 
regional director of Ofsted in monitoring underperforming schools; 

• placing a greater emphasis on longer-term outcomes of education – progression to 
higher education and employment – by publishing destination measures;  

• publishing data to hold local authorities to account on reducing the numbers of 
young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs); and 

• ensuring businesses can recruit the skills they need from abroad including by 
streamlining UK immigration rules and reducing backlogs of migration cases. 

Implementation – summary of key actions 

It is important to make sure these commitments are fully implemented. This will require the right 
cross-Whitehall machinery to be in place to ensure effective working between all relevant 
departments. The Government will also use regular ministerial implementation meetings to 
monitor and provide effective challenge and leadership.

1 Response to the Heseltine review 


 

A comprehensive plan for growth 
The Government’s economic strategy  

1.1 The UK economy is recovering from the most damaging financial crisis in generations 
following a decade of growth built on unsustainable levels of private and public sector debt. The 
Government inherited the largest deficit since the Second World War as a result of the financial 
crisis of 2008 and 2009 and unsustainable pre-crisis increases in public spending. This created 
the exceptional economic and fiscal challenges that the Government is now addressing. In many 
countries, recovery over the past four years has been slower than forecast. 

1.2 The Government’s immediate priority is to reduce the deficit and restore economic stability 
as essential pre-conditions for growth. The Government is taking decisive action through:  

• monetary activism and credit easing, to stimulate demand, maintain price stability 
and support the flow of credit in the economy; 

• deficit reduction, returning the public finances to a sustainable position and 
ensuring that fiscal credibility underpins low long-term interest rates; 

• reform of the financial system, improving the regulatory framework to reduce risks 
to the taxpayer and build the resilience of the system;  

• a comprehensive package of structural reforms, to rebalance and strengthen the 
economy for the future, including an ambitious programme of infrastructure 
investment; and  

• an ambitious industrial strategy, a long-term whole of government approach to 
supporting investment and growth, working in partnership with business. 

1.3 As a result, the public finances have been restored to a sustainable path and the UK is seen 
as a relative safe haven. Market interest rates have fallen to near record lows helping to keep 
interest payments lower for families, businesses and the taxpayer. The labour market has also 
performed stronger than forecast, with over one million jobs created in the private sector since 
the first quarter of 2010.1

The Plan for Growth 


 

1.4 Economic stability that comes from a credible deficit reduction plan is the essential starting 
point, but in itself is insufficient to put the UK on track to deliver long-term growth. Following 
extensive stakeholder engagement, the Government set out its comprehensive economic plan to 
create a stronger, more balanced economy of the future in the Plan for Growth.2

private sector

1.5 The Plan for Growth sets out an ambitious supply-side growth agenda spanning a range of 
policies including: cutting red-tape, reforming the planning system, boosting trade and inward 
investment and reforms to the UK’s world class higher education system. The Government has 
since set out further reforms at progressive Budgets and Autumn Statements and last year 
announced additional support through UK Guarantees and further improvements to housing 
and planning. The Government has already delivered: 

• a cut in the main rate of corporation tax from 28 per cent in 2010 to 24 per cent today 
– the lowest of any major western economy. This will fall to 21 per cent by 2014; 

• key reforms to schools to raise standards and improve choice for parents, with 
2,543 academies now open and 192 free schools either open or approved; 

• a programme of infrastructure investment and reform that has helped to increase 
total public and private UK infrastructure investment from £29 billion a year 
between 2005 and 2010 to £33 billion between 2010 and 2012; 

• over 450,000 new apprenticeships in 2010-11, and a further 500,000 in 2011-12; 

• a new emphasis on sustainable growth and cutting over 1,000 pages of planning 
policy to just 50; and 

• support to a further 32,000 UK firms to export through UK Trade and Investment 
(UKTI), increasing to 50,000 by 2014-15. 

1.6 Building on the Plan for Growth, in September 2012 the Government set out how it would 
develop an industrial strategy focusing on business and government working in partnership to 
establish an approach to support investment and growth. The Government has already taken 
action on a number of areas of its industrial strategy including: developing a spectrum of 
support for sectors and strategic partnerships for eleven sectors, supporting business access to 
finance and emerging technologies, leveraging business support for skills and giving business 
greater clarity over future public sector contracts. Further details are set out in this chapter. 

Going further – response to Lord Heseltine’s report 

1.7 To compete effectively in the global race the Government needs to build on and extend 
these reforms. Lord Heseltine’s report No Stone Unturned3

1.8 This chapter sets out a full and ambitious response to Lord Heseltine’s 89 recommendations. 
It sets out the necessary next steps the Government will be taking as part of its growth strategy 
to empower every part of the UK economy to raise its game. This response, together with 
reforms already taken by the Government to reduce the deficit, restore economic stability and 
create the conditions for long-term growth, represents a comprehensive economic plan to lay 
the foundations for a stronger, more balanced economy. 

 set out a comprehensive review of all 
aspects of government policy affecting economic growth. The Government welcomes this report 
and confirms that it is accepting in full or in part 81of Lord Heseltine’s 89 recommendations 
(Annex A). In five cases the Government has taken a different view: this document explains why. 
Three recommendations regarding the content of the Single Local Growth Fund will be taken at 
the Spending Round later this year. 

1.9 In responding to Lord Heseltine’s report, the Government acknowledges the important role 
of the devolved administrations to foster and promote growth across the whole of the UK. The 
recommendations in this report largely relate to policy areas that are devolved to Scotland,

Wales and Northern Ireland such as skills, planning and local growth. Where this is the case, the 
recommendations and the Government’s response apply to England only. However, the issues 
raised clearly have resonance across the UK and the Government remains committed to working 
with and supporting the devolved administrations to address similar issues in Scotland, Wales 
and Northern Ireland. Funding to enable each administration to fulfil their responsibilities is 
allocated through the block grant in line with the Statement of Funding Policy. 

Unleashing local growth 
1.10 Over recent decades, London and the south-east have been relied on as the primary source 
of economic growth in the UK. Despite significant investment in the regions, London, with 
around 13 per cent of the population, produces around 21.5 per cent of UK Gross Value Added 
(GVA), and has the highest GVA per head of all regions.4 But countries can be more successful 
when they are driven not just by their capitals, but by multiple thriving centres each with their 
own strengths. In a study of 124 second-tier cities and 31 capitals in Europe, Professor Michael 
Parkinson found that countries that spread responsibilities and powers more evenly across all 
cities are more successful than those with a dominant city.5

1.11 In his review of UK growth, Lord Heseltine makes a powerful case for increasing the 
decentralisation of economic powers in England from central government to local leaders who 
are best placed to understand the opportunities and obstacles to growth in their own 
communities. The Government shares Lord Heseltine’s vision. Every locality must be able to fulfil 
its full potential by taking responsibility for decisions and resources that affect their local 
economies. That is why the Government has taken steps towards a rebalanced economy, where 
every part of the UK – not just London and the south-east – drives strong and lasting growth. 
For example, the Government has already removed unnecessary ring-fences in local funding and 
has allowed local retention of business rates to provide local areas with greater flexibility. 
Furthermore, the success of the first round of City Deals demonstrates this Government’s 
commitment to decentralisation, empowering Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) and local 
authorities to reinvigorate local economies. 

1.12 The Government is now embarking on the next step, which will dramatically advance the 
process of decentralisation to unleash the potential of local economies and leaders, strengthen 
partnerships with industry at both the national and local level, foster economic growth and 
reverse a century of centralisation. This document sets out how. Autumn Statement 2012 set 
out an initial direction; the Government now confirms its ambition.  

Empowering Local Enterprise Partnerships 

1.13 The Government is undertaking a radical approach to decentralisation that will give 
business-led LEPs the power to make the choices that are right for their local economies. The 
Government is:  

• creating a Single Local Growth Fund, allocated through a process of negotiation and 
using competitive tension to strengthen incentives on LEPs and their partners to 
generate growth. The Government will review all funding streams identified by Lord 
Heseltine but sees three areas in particular as critical to the success of the Fund: 
transport, housing and skills. The Fund will be operational by April 2015 and further 
details will be set out at the Spending Round in June 2013, where due consideration 
of the implications for the devolved administrations will also be outlined; 

• asking LEPs to develop new strategic multi-year plans for local growth, which will 
be the basis for Government to negotiate deals with each LEP for levers, resources 
and the flexibility over them. Funding for local areas from the Single Local Growth 
Fund will reflect the quality of strategic proposals put forward by LEPs;  

• providing an additional £10 million per year as announced at Autumn Statement 
2012, to boost capacity within LEPs to support the development and delivery of 
their multi-year plans. While the Government will provide support, it firmly believes 
that LEPs should remain small, responsive, business-led organisations and avoid 
becoming local bureaucracies; 

• making available a new concessionary Public Works Loan Board Rate (PWLB) to an 
infrastructure project nominated by each LEP (excluding London), with the total 
borrowing capped at £1.5 billion. The PWLB project rate will be introduced from 1 
November 2013 and further details on allocation and access are being published 
alongside this response. This will support the strategic development of LEPs in 
working with their local authorities to identify and deliver a local priority 
infrastructure project; and  


     13 


• streamlining the management of the EU Structural and Investment Funds6

1.14 In implementing Lord Heseltine’s proposals the Government will apply lessons learned from the 
existing City Deals process, which has already seen the decentralisation of significant responsibilities. 



 in 

England, aligning priorities on the basis of the plans led by LEPs. This will include 
the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and part of 
the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  

Box 1.A: City Deals 

Cities and their wider economic areas account for 74 per cent of the UK’s population and 78 
per cent of UK jobs.7

The Government has already concluded deals with Greater Birmingham and Solihull, Bristol 
and the West of England, Greater Manchester, Leeds City Region, Liverpool City Region, 
Nottingham, Newcastle and Sheffield City Region. In Leeds for example, the Apprenticeship 
Training Agency (ATA) – a joint venture company between the city council and Leeds City 
College – has recently been established and is expected to become operational shortly. This 
will contribute to the creation of 2,500 new apprenticeships for young people across Leeds 
City Region. In total the cities have estimated that this first wave of deals will create 175,000 
jobs over the next 20 years and 37,000 new apprenticeships. 

 The Government has taken decisive action to give cities, as engines of 
economic growth, the powers and tools they need to drive growth through City Deals.  

The second wave of City Deals has invited 20 cities and their wider areas to compete for 
deals that will see the Government devolve powers in exchange for responsibility for 
delivering growth locally. As with the Single Local Growth Fund decisions, the Government 
will prioritise proposals that put forward robust and ambitious means of delivering economic 
growth plans, including through the use of Local Development Orders and other means of 
simplifying the planning decision process for local businesses. 

1.15 Chapter 2 sets out further detail on the Single Local Growth Fund. 

Reforming local and central government in support of localism 

1.16 The bold actions set out here will require local authorities to re-engineer how they promote 
growth and deliver services, and come together across the functional economic area represented 
by the LEP. Central government will also support this agenda and the capacity of LEPs. The 
Government will: 

• support local authorities that wish to create a combined authority or implement 
other forms of collaboration (for example, shared management), including through 
a £9.2 million Transformation Challenge Award; 

• not stand in the way of areas that would like to voluntarily pursue unitary status 
but believes it would be preferable for local authorities to focus on coming together 
to share their operations;  

• seek legislation for directly-elected mayors on combined authority boundaries, 
where local areas want this; 


 

6 These funds have been previously referred to as the Common Strategic Framework Funds. 
7 Unlocking growth in cities, HM Government, December 2011 


    14  


• assign every LEP a senior Whitehall sponsor who will work with them to understand 
their priorities and ensure that Whitehall policies take into account their impact on 
a particular place; and 

• enhance the arrangements in place for cross-departmental working through the 
development of Local Growth Teams, so that senior Whitehall sponsors can deploy 
these resources more effectively in co-ordinated support of LEPs. 

1.17 Further details are set out in Chapter 2. 

Transforming Whitehall processes in support of growth 
1.18 Lord Heseltine states that a key role for government is to set a clear growth strategy and to 
provide leadership for the overall direction of the UK economy, and he is right. That is why the 
Government has set out its comprehensive Plan for Growth to put the economy on a more 
stable footing. Implementation is an essential part of this. The Government ensures that 
progress towards its growth strategy is made fully transparent and has published updates 
alongside each Budget and Autumn Statement. The latest report will be published alongside 
Budget 2013. Regular discussions and challenge on growth implementation takes place in 
Cabinet discussion led by the Prime Minister as well as in supporting Committees such as the 
Growth Implementation Committee, chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Prime 
Minister has also mandated that all departments are departments for growth, which is reflected 
in the personal objectives of all Permanent Secretaries. But more can be done. 

1.19 The Government believes that cultural change is needed across all Whitehall departments 
and their public bodies, ensuring that growth is at the forefront of policy development and 
delivery. In line with Lord Heseltine’s recommendations, the government will:   

• ensure that growth is core to all departmental business plans, including harnessing 
the private-sector expertise of Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) and their experience 
of using effective management information to deliver these plans;  

• streamline the functions of public bodies by transferring the functions of 
government to the local level and private sector where appropriate, and where they 
are better placed to deliver services; 

• ensure that civil servants forge closer ties and interactions with businesses and 
representative bodies and obtain the necessary commercial skills to deliver pro-
growth policies; and 

• simplify and standardise the central government procurement framework to speed 
up procurements and drive value for money for the taxpayer. 

Putting growth at the centre of business planning 

1.20 In line with Lord Heseltine’s recommendation, the Government will continue to undertake 
significant actions to ensure that growth is a focus of the business plans of all departments. 
Annually published departmental business plans, which articulate policy and implementation 
priorities, will set out publicly how each department contributes to the Government’s growth 
agenda. Departments will set out significant, time-bound growth actions, progress against 
which will be tracked on the Government’s business plans website8


 

8 Business plans are published on the Number 10 website http://transparency.number10.gov.uk/ 

 with explanations published 
for any slippage, in line with other key policy and implementation actions. 


     15 


1.21 The Government recognises the private-sector expertise and experience that NEDs can bring 
to departments. The Government continues to seek NED expertise on areas such as performance 
indicators, operational implications of policy proposals and effective management of departments 
in business planning, as well as in supporting the delivery of departmental growth commitments. 
To increase the ability of NEDs to challenge departments and hold them to account on their 
growth commitments, the Government accepts Lord Heseltine’s recommendation and 
departmental NEDs will have access to officials supporting growth implementation. Underpinning 
departmental planning and under the guidance of NEDs, the Government is simplifying and 
improving the quality of operational management information to enable departments and the 
public sector to have a tighter grip on how they spend their budgets and their costs, outputs and 
impacts in line with the principles recommended by Lord Heseltine. 

1.22 Alongside this, all departments should work with their Chief Scientific Advisers on 
developing their growth commitments. The collective Chief Scientific Advisers Committee meets 
regularly with the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) and the heads of the Research Councils. This 
forum will be used to discuss departmental growth commitments.  

Streamlining the functions of government 

1.23 The renewed focus on departmental business planning will enable the Government to 
focus on another key aim in the reform of Whitehall: streamlining central government. The 
Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that it should devolve where possible the functions of 
public bodies to the private sector and the local level to enable greater efficiency in the delivery 
of services. Since 2010, the Government has taken significant steps to streamline the number of 
public bodies. This has already resulted in a 25 per cent reduction and will ultimately reduce the 
number by a third. Following the Public Bodies Review 2010,9

1.24 Building on this, the Government is currently testing the viability of a joint venture for 
Remploy Employment Services, bringing in expertise and investment from a private and/or third 
sector partner. Further details will be set out shortly. In addition, the Government will be rolling 
out new ‘Rights to Provide’, enabling employees to request or bid to take over the services they 
deliver, and will continue to look at opportunities for transferring more functions to the local 
level, private sector and new alternative models for delivery. This includes the creation of public 
service mutuals, which offer significant potential to drive growth through expansion and 
diversification of services. The Government’s £10 million Mutual Support Fund offers potential 
mutuals the support they need to spin out of the public sector. The number of mutuals has 
increased from just nine in 2010 to at least 66 today, delivering around £1 billion worth of 
public services. 

 all remaining non-departmental 
public bodies (NDPBs) will undergo a Triennial Review – a fundamental review of their purpose 
and functions during which greater devolution of their functions will be considered. Recent 
examples of action the Government has taken include: the transfer of British Waterways to the 
care of Canal and River Trust, the new waterways charity; and outsourcing the work of the Audit 
Commission’s in-house audit practice to private sector audit firms.  

1.25 The Government also agrees with Lord Heseltine that public bodies need to take greater 
responsibility for economic growth and wealth creation. A new Peer Network Group will enable 
departments to explore how best to work with public bodies in considering their potential for 
supporting wealth creation when developing business plans, so that these opportunities are 
translated into tangible actions. In addition, the Government will review its guidance on Triennial 
Reviews of public bodies to consider how to give greater significance to the wealth creation

    16  


potential of these bodies, strengthening the requirement already in place to consider and 
determine whether alternative commercial models could be better used to deliver these functions. 

Introducing private sector skills into the civil service 

1.26 As identified by Lord Heseltine, the civil service must embody a wider set of skills, including 
engaging with the private sector to enable creative solutions, transform public services and drive 
growth. The Government is therefore producing a five year capabilities plan for the civil service 
to identify which skills and capabilities are in deficit and to determine how gaps will be filled. 

1.27 As a first step towards addressing an identified skills gap, the Government will focus on 
strengthening commercial, procurement, digital, and change management skills within the civil 
service in line with the findings of the Civil Service Reform Plan.10

1.28 The Government agrees with Lord Heseltine on the importance of allowing departments 
the flexibility to recruit professionals with the required skills where there is a business need and 
the skills do not exist in the civil service. There is already scope to agree to higher salaries where 
they are needed, subject to Ministerial approval. As set out in the Corporate Governance Code,

 On commercial skills, 
Infrastructure UK (IUK) and the Major Projects Authority (MPA) are currently undertaking a 
review of Whitehall’s ability to deliver infrastructure projects, with further details set out at 
Budget 2013. In line with Lord Heseltine’s recommendations on government procurement, the 
Government has established a Procurement Reform Programme which, alongside other 
objectives, seeks to develop the commercial skills of all civil servants and enable a greater focus 
on delivering the most important projects.  


11

1.29 Improving interchange and learning between the private and public sector is essential in 
ensuring that the civil service obtain valuable insights into how business operates and how 
government policy impacts on them. The Government will therefore encourage greater 
interaction with private sector professionals through secondments and training opportunities. 
From April 2013, subject to their individual development need, all new entrants to the Graduate 
Fast Stream will have the opportunity to undertake a secondment either in the private sector 
(including small and medium sized enterprises), in local government, or third sector 
organisations. In 2014 between 200 and 300 secondments are expected to take place. Similar 
arrangements will be developed for talented individuals at more senior levels as part of the High 
Potential Stream.  


 

all departments are expected to include NEDs in their Governance and Nominations Committees, 
which focus on remuneration and other related issues. 

1.30 The Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that Civil Service Learning should have a 
greater private sector ethos. Civil Service Learning is now delivered through Capita – and its 
private sector supply chain – and is a commissioner of training, not a direct provider. Given this, 
Civil Service Learning cannot be privatised or its services sold overseas. However, in line with Lord 
Heseltine’s recommendation and the renewed focus on fostering links between the public and 
private sectors, the civil service can now train alongside private sector professionals including in 
joint sector master classes, leadership programmes and mentoring. 

1.31 In accordance with Lord Heseltine’s recommendation, a new central role for NEDs has  
been established in both the selection and appointment of Permanent Secretaries. NEDs must 
now be consulted on the person specification and the most suitable mode of recruitment to

fill a Permanent Secretary post. They will also participate in the panel sifting and interviewing  
of applicants. 

Simplifying and standardising government procurement 

1.32 In addition to boosting commercial and procurement expertise at the centre, the 
Government has also introduced a radical programme of procurement reform to simplify, 
standardise and speed up central government procurement, drive value for money for the 
taxpayer, and provide greater certainty for business. All but the most complex procurements 
should be completed within 120 working days. The Government has also eliminated 
burdensome Pre-Qualification Questionnaires for procurements below European Union (EU) 
thresholds in most Whitehall departments and advertises all central government opportunities 
over £10,000 on Contracts Finder, a government procurement portal, to promote greater 
transparency. This has resulted in an increased proportion of central government spend with 
small businesses from 6.5 per cent in 2009-10 to 10 per cent in 2011-12, an increase of around 
£1.3 billion.  

1.33 The Government is driving greater value from central government procurement through 
the aggregation of spend on common goods and services, which has saved over £700 million 
between 2010 and 2012. The Government is also publishing pipelines of upcoming future 
procurement opportunities, which provides industry with greater certainty as to the 
Government’s future needs and introduces greater pre-market engagement.  

1.34 The Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that, where appropriate, departments and 
significant agencies should recruit Chief Procurement Officers to lead on procurement. Furthermore, 
as part of the Government’s Procurement Reform Programme, from April 2013 there will be 
reporting lines from the Government’s Chief Procurement Officer to commercial directors that will 
strengthen the focus on pan-government objectives and improve performance assessment. 

1.35 Lord Heseltine advocates that a general duty should be placed on all pubic bodies, to 
ensure they adhere to procurement standards. The Prime Minister’s advisor on enterprise, Lord 
Young, is also considering the role of public procurement standards in supporting SMEs and 
micro-businesses and is due to publish his second report later this year. Following this work, the 
Government will consult on high level standards, which all public bodies should be looking to 
achieve. In addition, the Government will continue to ensure that tools such as Contracts Finder 
are available to the wider public sector and encourage local government and public bodies to 
make use of them. The Government will also continue to actively investigate cases of complaints 
of poor procurement practice in local government and the wider public sector. 

Boosting engagement with business 
1.36 Lord Heseltine’s report emphasises the importance of government increasing its 
engagement with business and major sectors of the economy that are crucial to economic 
growth. This is a key priority of the Government’s work on industrial strategy. Building on Lord 
Heseltine’s recommendations, the Government will therefore: 

• continue to drive forward its industrial strategy and strengthen partnerships with 
business to provide confidence and spur business investment;  

• continue to forge stronger links with researchers, universities and business to 
develop, support and maintain the UK’s world class knowledge base; and 

• increase engagement with foreign and domestic investors including the expansion 
of the Strategic Relationship Management (SRM) programme. 


    18  


Building stronger partnerships with industry  

1.37 In September 2012, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills set out the 
Government’s approach to industrial strategy.12

1.38 The Government is working closely with business to develop a spectrum of support for 
sectors (Chart 1.B), which allows all sectors of the economy to form a relationship with 
government at the most appropriate level. The Government is developing strategic partnerships 
strategies in 11 sectors. The strategy for UK life sciences one year on

 As part of this, the Government committed to 
establishing or developing existing sector council arrangements in the sectors where the 
Government is developing and implementing strategies with business. This will improve 
interaction with industry and show leadership in sectors that have the greatest growth potential 
and where government action can have the greatest impact. Progress has already been made in 
establishing these. In line with Lord Heseltine’s recommendation, the Government has created 
industrial strategy partnership councils in sectors including automotive, aerospace, nuclear, 
construction, offshore wind, and oil and gas.  


13

Chart 1.B: Spectrum of support for different sectors of the economy 

 was published in 
December 2012, and the Government and industry will co-create individual strategies in the 
automotive, aerospace, life sciences, agri-tech, professional business services, information 
economy, construction, education, nuclear, oil and gas, and offshore wind sectors by the 
summer. These sector strategies will set out actions for industry and government.

     19 


1.39 As part of the industrial strategy, the Government is also: 

• supporting emerging technologies – £600 million of capital investment announced 
at Autumn Statement 2012 is being used to support the development and 
commercialisation of eight great technologies (further details in Box 1.B); 

• supporting small businesses to access finance – the Government is establishing a 
Business Bank to address structural gaps in the supply of finance to small 
businesses. An advisory group chaired by Sir Peter Burt has been established to 
advise on the direction and priorities of the Bank (further details on page 29); 

• leveraging business support for skills – the Government has launched the second 
round of the Employer Ownership Pilot, which brings in private sector investment 
and gives business greater control over how funding is spent; and  

• providing greater certainty over public sector procurement – publishing a pipeline 
to give business greater clarity over future public sector contracts. This now stands 
at £84 billion of potential opportunities.  

1.40 While the Government recognises the value that effective trade associations can provide in 
the development of industrial policy, it is not for government to nominate the trade associations 
it will choose to interact with. The Government is aware that in some sectors there is a need for 
representation by more than one body and it is for sectors to identify how they might best be 
represented and develop proposals for rationalising the number of bodies representing them.   

Supporting a world-class knowledge base  

1.41 The UK’s knowledge base is world class and a source of international comparative advantage: 

• with four of the top six universities in the world, the UK’s research base is second in 
the world only to the USA, and is the most productive country for research in the 
G8, in terms of citations and publications per pound spent;14

• researchers in the UK have won 77 Nobel Prizes for science and technology, more 
than anywhere else in Europe;


 15

• the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report now ranks the UK 
2nd in the world, ahead of the USA, for university-industry collaboration in research 
and development.

 and 


16

1.42 To make sure that the UK stays ahead in the global race, the Government is creating an 
environment in which research and innovative businesses can thrive and take advantage of the 
technologies of tomorrow. Despite enormous pressure on public spending, £4.6 billion per year 
was allocated for science and research programmes over the four years of the Spending Review 
period. In addition to the £1.9 billion capital funding for science and research originally 
allocated for 2011-15, the Government has also invested an additional £1.5 billion in science, 
research and innovation, and including most recently £600 million at Autumn Statement 2012 
for supporting the eight great technologies. This will ensure that the UK continues to reap the 
benefits of science, research and innovation.

Box 1.B: The eight great technologies 

In January 2013, the Government set out how it would use the £600 million announced for 
science at Autumn Statement 2012 to support the eight great technologies which will 
propel the UK to future growth and help it stay ahead in the global race:  

• £189 million for big data and energy efficient computing to build on the research 
base’s capacity for analysing big data sets, in areas like earth observation and 
medical science; 

• £25 million of additional funding for the National Space Technology Programme 
for the development of commercial products and services using space technology 
and data from space-based systems; 

• £35 million for centres of excellence in robotics and autonomous systems to be 
created in and around universities, innovation centres, science parks and 
enterprise sites to bring together the research base and industry; 

• £45 million for new facilities and equipment for advanced materials research in 
areas of UK strength such as advanced composites, high-performance alloys, low-
energy electronics and telecommunications; 

• £30 million to create dedicated research and development facilities to develop 
and test new grid-scale storage technologies, helping the UK capitalise on its 
considerable excess energy production, saving money and reducing the national 
carbon footprint; 

• £50 million for vital upgrades to research equipment and laboratories;  

• £25 million to develop the Advanced Metrology Laboratory at the National 
Physical Laboratory in Teddington, allowing scientists there to undertake cutting 
edge research in measurement science; and 

• £65 million for world-leading research institutes, focussed around the 
development of Rothamsted Research Campus, Aberystwyth, Harwell Oxford and 
SciTech Daresbury. 

1.43 In 2011, the Government set out its Innovation and Research Strategy for Growth.17 A key 
principle of this strategy, also identified by Lord Heseltine, is the importance of inward 
investment and the role of government in leveraging the UK’s world class research base and hi-
tech sectors when marketing the UK overseas. UKTI and the TSB, in conjunction with Research 
Councils and other innovation stakeholders are committed to working closer together on 
marketing. UKTI and the TSB routinely undertake a range of joint activities including missions 
and events with a focus on marketing the UK’s strengths overseas. The Government commits to 
fully exploiting these partnerships and working with stakeholders to find more effective ways to 
market the UK’s research and innovation excellence, including through the GREAT branding that 
has proved effective across a range of sectors.18

1.44 Lord Heseltine advocates the need for the Government’s support for innovation to be 
better connected to localities. As part of its’ commitment to empowering local areas, the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the TSB will build on existing work to 
develop a more strategic approach in engaging devolved administrations, local partners and

working within new sub-national arrangements including LEPs. This will include: raising 
awareness of TSB programmes with local partners and encouraging them to inform local 
businesses of innovation programmes and funding opportunities; drawing on national and local 
intelligence to help shape future TSB programmes; and offering guidance to partners to align 
activities with the national framework.  

1.45 The Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that timely, consensus-based use of standards 
play a vital role in ensuring that the knowledge created in the UK’s research base is 
commercialised and brought to market. The British Standards Institution and the TSB have 
agreed to explore four pilot technology areas – synthetic biology, assisted living, cell therapy and 
offshore renewable energy – where they will work together to consider how and when 
standards can support the development of emerging technology areas and whether more 
detailed projects should be taken forward. This work will consider the international context and 
whether the UK will gain a significant first mover advantage from early standards development. 

1.46 Lord Heseltine underlined the importance of public procurement as a means of fostering 
and supporting innovation and identified that the Government needs to build its capability as an 
intelligent lead customer for innovation by developing a single source of expertise. The 
Government agrees with this analysis and the TSB as the UK’s innovation agency, operates in the 
space between government and business in providing the knowledge and expertise, such as in 
connection with the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) programme (Box 1.C), to help 
government work with business to develop innovative solutions to challenges faced by the 
public sector. The Government will build on this existing work and see the TSB as the central 
source of expertise, working collaboratively with government departments and partners in the 
innovation system. 

Box 1.C:  The Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) 

SBRI is a competition-based procurement programme managed and delivered for the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills by the TSB. SBRI provides a mechanism to 
enable public sector organisations to find innovative solutions for specific public sector 
challenges and allows them to access a wide range of technologies, industries, and 
innovative companies. SBRI has 120 full competitions, which have so far awarded over 1,200 
contracts with a value of over £100 million. This has stimulated the development of a wide 
range of innovative solutions from small companies, many of whom have subsequently 
secured additional private sector investment and formed wider commercial partnerships to 
take their products to market. 

A strategic approach to inward investment 

1.47 The Government’s position on inward investment is clear: the UK is open for business. The 
Government believes that direct investment by foreign companies can bring in new ideas, 
technologies and skills, stimulating productivity and growth in UK firms and opening up new 
markets for trade. Inward investors account for around half of UK manufacturing output and 
around 40 per cent of services output;19

investment by 1,400 companies safeguarded or created more than 112,000 jobs.21

1.48 Lord Heseltine’s review notes that inward investment has on balance been a force for good 
for the UK but remarks on the lack of engagement by successive UK governments in takeovers 
by foreign investors. The Government is committed to open markets and is equally committed to 
engaging with companies and investors to promote investment which benefits the UK economy.  

1.49 UKTI’s SRM programme is an important example of how the Government is establishing 
better relationships with key exporters and both foreign and domestic investors. At Autumn 
Statement 2012, the Government accepted Lord Heseltine’s recommendation to double the 
number of companies enrolled in the SRM initiative by April 2013 and this will be achieved by 
Budget 2013. The Government will seek to double the number of companies managed again by 
2015 and will ensure that every department has the dedicated staff to support this 
commitment. 

Creating the conditions for long-term growth 
1.50 The Government has a key role to play in creating the conditions for long-term sustainable 
growth in the UK. Supply-side reforms are essential to the UK’s success in the global race and to 
ensure that UK businesses are competitive both here and in important export markets, and that 
the UK is attractive to inward investors. While the Government has already taken substantial 
action to support structural reform in the UK, further reform is needed in key areas. The 
Government is therefore building on a number of recommendations specified by Lord Heseltine: 

• implementing a new approach to regulators to improve regulatory enforcement 
and thereby removing unnecessary burdens on business, and lobbying the EU 
Commission to reduce burdensome EU regulation;  


 

20 fDi Intelligence, Financial Times Ltd, 2013 
21 Plan for Growth Implementation Update, HM Treasury and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, December 2012 


     23 


• reforming the planning system to reduce costs and bring speed and certainty to 
business; and 

• addressing under-investment in the UK’s infrastructure and providing investment 
opportunities for the private sector. 

A new approach to regulation and regulators 

1.51 The cumulative additional cost to business of new regulations introduced between 1998 
and 2010 is estimated at nearly £90 billion a year.22

1.52 The Government has also committed to abolishing or substantially reducing at least 3,000 
regulations through the Red Tape Challenge. For example, the Government is implementing 
employment tribunal reforms to save business in total over £40 million per year and significantly 
rationalising the complexity of building rules and regulations for house builders. The 
Government is now going further: it has increased its ambition to One-in, Two-out, launched in 
January 2013, and will shortly launch a second phase of its ongoing drive to tackle red tape.  

 Lord Heseltine identifies the importance of 
regulatory reform in boosting long-term economic growth. The Government shares this view 
and reducing the burden of regulation on business continues to play a central part in the 
Government’s growth strategy. By December 2012, the Government had already reduced the 
net burden of regulation on business by almost £840 million by operating a One-in, One-out 
rule for new regulation. This rule, combined with independent scrutiny of analysis, commitment 
to exempt or mitigate the impacts on the smallest businesses and a commitment to review and 
sunset new regulations where appropriate is changing how Whitehall approaches regulation.

1.53 Through the Focus on Enforcement initiative, which was announced at Budget 2012, the 
Government has been working with industry to examine the way regulation is enforced by 
national and local regulators in a wide variety of sectors. These reviews are ongoing and are 
looking, amongst other things, to simplify procedures and remove unnecessary duplication 
between agencies. Focus on Enforcement reviews have shown that the way regulation is 
enforced can be just as problematic to industry as the regulation itself and that improving 


 

22 The Burdens Barometer 2010, British Chambers of Commerce, May 2010 
23 The numbers presented here cover regulations that are only in the scope of One-in, One-out and do not cover EU regulations, financial services and 
fees. The ‘Ins’ figure only includes those regulations that have a net cost to business. 


    24  


enforcement can also significantly reduce burdens and remove barriers. Lord Heseltine’s report 
identified similar issues. The Government has already acted to address his recommendations 
through a package of reforms announced at Autumn Statement 2012 and is making good 
progress. The Government has: 

• recently consulted on placing a legislative duty on non-economic regulators to have 
regard for growth and take account the economic impacts of their actions; and on 
a shorter and more accessible version of the Regulators Compliance Code, which 
will ensure that regulators are properly applying the principles of better regulation 
and provide those they regulate with minimum standards; 

• initiated work to require regulators to quantify and publish, in advance of 
implementation, their assessment of the costs and benefits of all changes to their 
policy and practices that have a financial impact on business. The new regime is 
already being developed and applied with pioneer regulators with the final system 
to apply to other regulators from July 2013;  

• placed regulators under a duty to bear down on their costs and explain 
transparently how their costs and fees have been calculated. Any necessary 
amendments to memorandums of understanding and framework documents 
between departments and regulators will be made by 1 April 2013; 

• launched a Focus on Enforcement Review of non-economic regulator appeals 
processes, including looking at how customers can ask for an independent second 
opinion to address concerns raised about weaknesses in current arrangements; and 

• begun a review of the appeals framework for decisions made by economic 
regulators, with the aim of making appeals against economic regulators’ decisions 
quicker and more efficient. The Government will consult on the new framework by 
summer 2013. 

1.54 In addition to these measures, the Government agrees that all departments should 
consider the effect of regulations on the sectors they most impact. Each department should 
welcome and invite views of industry on the drafting of new regulation and take into account 
those views during consultations.  

Promoting the better regulation agenda in Brussels 

1.55 Up to half of all regulations that impact on UK businesses originate from the EU. That is 
why the Government is actively pursuing its better regulation agenda in Brussels. The 
Government is making significant progress: an exemption for micro-enterprises from new EU 
proposals where appropriate; persuading the Commission to publish in March 2013 an SME 
scoreboard, which details progress to date against its existing commitments to reduce burdens 
on SMEs; and influencing the Commission to launch a new REFIT programme to eliminate 
unnecessary costs arising from EU regulation and to ensure the body of EU legislation remains fit 
for purpose. A key part of this success has been engaging and influencing early in the process of 
EU policy-making. The Government will continue to actively promote and pursue its better 
regulation goals in Brussels, including stepping up senior ministerial engagement with this 
agenda. 

Reforming the planning system 

1.56 As rightly identified by Lord Heseltine, planning decisions in England can be lengthy and 
bureaucratic, raising costs for business and adversely impacting on growth. While the 
Government has taken radical steps to overhaul the planning system and tackle delays, more 


     25 


needs to be done. In 2011-12 only 58 per cent of major planning applications were determined 
within the required 13-week timetable.24 Furthermore there are very significant variations in the 
performance of different local councils and the proportion of major decisions made on time in 
the very poorest performing authorities can be as low as 17 per cent.25

1.57 The Government therefore believes that local authorities must be at the centre of 
improvements to planning. In support of this, the Government is promoting more transparent 
reporting of local authority performance on planning and is working with the Local Government 
Association to increase the use of planning performance agreements for major schemes. These 
commit both applicants and planning authorities to a clear timetable for determining proposals. 
The Government is also legislating to allow planning applications for major developments to be 
submitted directly to the Planning Inspectorate, if the local planning authority has a track record 
of consistently poor performance in the speed or quality of its decisions.  


  

1.58 In line with Lord Heseltine’s recommendation, the Government has powers to intervene, 
where appropriate, in planning applications at any stage before determination. The Planning 
Inspectorate can act on behalf of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, 
to consider all planning issues involved before making a recommendation. Applicants may also 
appeal to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government if no decision has been 
reached within the statutory period of 13 weeks for major applications and eight weeks for 
others. Going further, the Government has recently asked the Planning Inspectorate to divert 
resources towards prioritising all major economic and housing related appeals, to ensure 
applicants receive a response in the quickest possible time. The Government has also recently 
consulted on options to speed up planning appeals and for a new fast-track procedure for some 
small commercial appeals.  

1.59 The Government also agrees with Lord Heseltine that Local Development Orders (LDOs) can 
bring speed, certainty and reduced costs to the planning process. 40 LDOs have been put in 
place within Enterprise Zones and elsewhere with many more in the pipeline. The Government is 
also in discussion with the Local Government Association to streamline the process for using 
LDOs through the Growth and Infrastructure Bill. The Government will continue to encourage 
local authorities across the country to make better use of LDOs and other planning simplification 
measures, including those that can help to support investment in Enterprise Zones. Together 
with the use of Special Development Orders (SDOs) for larger developments where appropriate, 
the Government will continue to make use of existing tools to speed up decisions in the 
planning system.  

1.60 Lord Heseltine recommended that the Government Property Unit (GPU) should work with 
local authorities to identify and publish details of surplus and derelict public land in the 
Electronic Property Information Mapping Service (e-PIMS) database so the land can be brought 
back into use. The Government has made good progress on this, and a new public funding 
portal was launched in January 2013 to improve the awareness of e-PIMS information and the 
availability of surplus assets initially for the public, voluntary and commercial sectors. In addition, 
the GPU and the Local Government Association have identified 12 local authority pilot areas to 
work with for 2013-14: Bristol, Chester and Cheshire West, Essex, Hampshire, Hull, Leeds, 
Nottingham, Portsmouth, Sheffield, Surrey, Warrington, Worcestershire, where the assets of 
central government and the wider public sector can be brought together into a programme 
which achieves best value. These pilots will work closely with Community Budgets and City Deals 
already in place.

Developing the UK’s Infrastructure 

1.61 Infrastructure forms the backbone of a modern economy and is vital to long-term 
economic growth. However, years of under-investment have left the UK’s infrastructure bursting 
at the seams and struggling to keep pace with the demands of a growing population. To 
address this, the Government has made infrastructure a central part of its growth agenda, for 
instance committing £5.5 billion in additional infrastructure investment at Autumn Statement 
2012, including up to £1.5 billion for the road network. This builds on the £6.3 billion of 
additional infrastructure spending announced at Autumn Statement 2011, as well as the £9.4 
billion supported investment in the High Level Output Specification programme, the biggest 
investment in the railways since Victorian times.  

1.62 Furthermore, the Government is taking a more strategic approach to infrastructure 
investment and set out for the first time a long-term plan for the UK’s infrastructure in the 
National Infrastructure Plan.26

Chart 1.E: Average annual infrastructure investment in the UK, public and private 

 It prioritises the top 40 projects that are critical for the UK’s 
economic future and includes a forward looking investment pipeline, consisting of £310 billion 
of projects, which gives greater clarity and certainty to investors.

1.63 Lord Heseltine highlights the importance of encouraging private and pension fund 
investment in the UK’s infrastructure. The Government is actively supporting and encouraging 
private investment, including providing up to £40 billion of guarantees to support major 
infrastructure projects, including up to £1 billion for the Northern Line extension to Battersea. 
The National Association of Pension Funds and the Pension Protection Fund have also now 
secured £1 billion of investment capital and ten pension funds as founding investors in the 
Pensions Infrastructure Platform. This is a welcome development which will bring more 
investment to UK infrastructure assets.  

1.64 The Thames Gateway project is highlighted by Lord Heseltine as crucial to future UK 
competitiveness. The Government agrees. Through the 2011 Localism Act the Government has 


 

26 National Infrastructure Plan; update 2012, HM Treasury and Infrastructure UK, December 2012 
27 Infrastructure investment estimates are indicative and reflect the information held within government on infrastructure investment and other public 
sources of information. Data about purely private investment is subject to greater uncertainty than that for public sector or regulated investment. To 
enable analysis some observations have been estimated to provide annual breakdowns of totals and to fill gaps in the information available. 


     27 


provided the tools to enable the Mayor of London to designate any area of land in Greater 
London as a Mayoral Development Area and to set up Mayoral Development Corporations to 
manage the regeneration process provided he has the support of the London Assembly in doing 
so. For example, to support the delivery of a sustainable Olympic legacy, the Mayor has already 
taken advantage of this new power and set up the London Legacy Development Corporation. 
Following localisation of the Thames Gateway Development Corporation, local authority leaders 
in London, Kent and Essex have developed a streamlined governance model – the Thames 
Gateway Strategic Group (TGSG) - to focus on strategic priorities and targeted solutions to 
realise the areas potential. It includes private-sector representation including the chairs of the 
south-east and London LEPs. 

1.65 The Government recognises that maintaining the UK’s international connectivity is critical 
to long term economic growth, but without an agreed evidence base or political consensus, it 
will not be possible to deliver a lasting solution that is right for the UK. A long-term approach is 
required to secure the UK’s competitiveness and London’s status as a centre of global trade. The 
Government has therefore asked the Airports Commission to present an interim report by the 
end of this year, which will set out its assessment of the nature, scale and timing of steps 
needed to maintain the UK’s global hub status. It will set out recommendations for immediate 
actions to improve the use of existing runway capacity in the next five years, consistent with 
credible long-term options. In the short-term, the Government continues to undertake a 
package of measures to make the best use of existing airports, encourage investment and 
improve surface access provision to the benefit of air passengers and the wider economy. 

1.66 A secure and affordable supply of energy is crucial to economic growth. Lord Heseltine 
advocates a definitive UK energy policy that will give certainty to the sector to invest. The 
Electricity Market Reform will bring about the biggest transformation of the UK’s electricity 
sector since privatisation. Measures have been included in the November 2012 Energy Bill to 
give the certainty that investors need to build new nuclear, carbon capture and storage and 
renewables in the UK, for example: 

• Contracts for Difference (CfDs) – long term contracts that provide stable revenues 
for investors in low carbon energy projects at a fixed level known as a strike price. 
CfDs will provide long-term certainty for investors in low carbon generation. This 
will lower the cost of capital and help developers secure the large upfront amounts 
of capital investment required; 

• the creation of a government-owned company to act as a single counterparty to 
the CfDs to give investors confidence to enter into new long term CfDs for low 
carbon electricity projects; and  

• powers to introduce a Capacity Market – allowing for capacity auctions from 2014 
for delivery of capacity in the winter of 2018-19, to help ensure the lights stay on 
even at times of peak demand. 

1.67 The Government also provided certainty to gas investors through the Gas Generation 
Strategy28


 

28 Gas Generation Strategy, Department of Energy and Climate Change, December 2012 

 which was published alongside Autumn Statement 2012. This set out the 
Government’s view of the future role of gas and the measures being taken to ensure sufficient 
investment. It made clear that by setting a sustainable and affordable cap on the Levy Control 
Framework out to 2020 (£7.6 billion per year), the Government is seeking to provide certainty 
for investors in both low-carbon energy sources and gas. In addition, the Government 


    28  


announced in October 2012 that it would engage with industry to develop a targeted tax 
regime for shale gas. 

Fostering private-sector led growth 
1.68 The UK is one of the best places in the world to do business. The UK now ranks 8th in the 
WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report 2012-13, up two places from 2011-12;29 and ranks 7th in 
the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business report (Chart 1.F).30

1.69 Despite this, further reform is required, in particular for small businesses that still have 
problems accessing finance and support. While the Government has a key role in creating the 
conditions for growth, the private sector also has an important role in developing and sharing 
their capacity for growth. Lord Heseltine sets out a number of recommendations aimed at 
encouraging this. The Government endorses this, and is supporting the private sector by: 

• creating a Business Bank to help address structural gaps in the supply of long-term 
patient capital to SMEs; 

• considering how best to improve co-ordination of business support, to help small 
businesses navigate the diverse market; 

• recognising the role of trade associations in improving business performance and 
encouraging them to undertake reforms to improve their effectiveness;  

• enhancing the global competitiveness of UK supply chains, learning from best 
practice in the manufacturing sector; and 

• encouraging business schools to play a greater part in improving the leadership and 
management capability of local businesses.

Ensuring small businesses can access finance and support 

1.70 The UK’s SMEs are responsible for almost half of the £900 billion private sector output and 
60 per cent, or almost 14 million, of private sector jobs. However, the financial crisis has 
impacted on SMEs’ ability to access credit. The Government has already taken action to ease the 
flow of credit to SMEs, through, for example, the Enterprise Finance Guarantee and the Bank of 
England Funding for Lending Scheme, both of which encourage the banks to increase lending.  

1.71 As announced at Autumn Statement 2012, the Government is also creating a Business 
Bank that will deploy £1 billion to address structural gaps in the supply of finance to SMEs, in 
particular the supply of long-term patient capital, as advocated by Lord Heseltine; and to bring 
together the range of existing government access to finance interventions for SMEs. The 
Government is keen to explore joint investment opportunities with the private sector as a way of 
maximising the reach and impact of the Business Bank. This could include partnership with 
private finance providers or the design and financing of wholesale finance products delivered by 
lenders to businesses. Details on progress towards establishing the Business Bank will be set out 
in March 2013.  

Improving the business support landscape 

1.72 The Government agrees with Lord Heseltine’s analysis that SMEs require further support to 
fulfil their full potential. There is a wide range of advice and support available to small 
businesses but they often struggle to find what they need. There is therefore a clear need to 
improve co-ordination in the market for business advice. The Government recognises the 
important part local chambers of commerce play, both in representing the interests of 
businesses and in the provision of business advice at a local level. However, at the local level, the 
Government believes LEPs are best placed to aid the creation of strong and stable locally based 
private sector support networks for business, working with chambers, other bodies, private 
sector providers and other local partners. The Government encourages these organisations to 
work closely together to provide more engagement and support at the local level, and to agree 
the best way of providing a single, efficient, local signpost service for SMEs to find the help 
available in their area. 

1.73 The Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that businesses should be made better aware 
of the advantages of membership of local chambers and other relevant business support bodies 
and the services they provide. The Government will therefore draw local authorities’ attention to 
Lord Heseltine’s report and encourage them to make available information on local businesses 
paying business rates, taking account of data protection legislation.  

1.74 For its own part, the Government has already undertaken a major reform of the business 
support landscape. This includes providing support services online and via a helpline, fostering 
the development of a network of 27,000 business mentors available through mentorsme.co.uk, 
and supporting the growth of 4,000 high-growth potential firms through Growth Accelerator 
since its launch in May 2012. The development of the Business Bank to bring support for SMEs 
together will complement this. It is important to assess how the market is responding to these 
changes. The Government will engage with stakeholders on how best to improve co-ordination 
and help small businesses navigate the diverse market for business support. The Government 
will publish a statement of government policy in the summer. 

Encouraging trade associations to improve their standards 

1.75 Trade associations can have an important role in providing support to their members in 
activities such as training, skills development, mentoring and supply chain development. The 
Government endorses Lord Heseltine’s recommendations for the Trade Association Forum (TAF) 


    30  


to share best practice and set out minimum requirements for the standard of trade associations, 
create a competency framework to promote increased professionalism, and develop an 
enhanced directory of associations:  

• TAF is currently revising its Code of Practice on minimum requirements for the 
standard of trade associations with plans to consult its members and produce a 
revised version by autumn 2013; 

• TAF is working with MemberWise and the Professionalism Group on the 
development of a competency framework. The framework is being piloted with four 
member organisations with a view to releasing a web-based toolkit in 2014; and 

• TAF has a directory of trade associations on its website and plans to explore options 
for using this platform to create a much-improved, comprehensive and user-friendly 
product that captures several layers of information, depending on user need. 

Sharing best practice on supply-chain programmes 

1.76 As identified by Lord Heseltine, large companies that head-up supply chains can have a 
huge influence on the quality, performance and prospects of their suppliers and the companies 
beneath them. Enhancing the global competitiveness of UK supply chains can significantly 
further growth in a particular sector. For example, through the Advanced Manufacturing Supply 
Chain Initiative (AMSCI), the Government has provided £245 million to help improve the global 
competitiveness of UK manufacturing supply chains, which includes £120 million that was 
announced at Autumn Statement 2012. The Government will analyse and share the cross-
government experience of AMSCI to assist departments if they wish to utilise the programme. 

Box 1.D: AMSCI - supply chain collaboration to build a new proving factory of low carbon 
technologies in the automotive sector 

£12.8 million of AMSCI funding has been awarded to a collaboration of 11 partners from all 
levels of the supply chain to design and build a proving factory to enable mass production of 
new low carbon technologies in the automotive sector. The lead partners are Productiv and 
Tata Steel, with nine supporting partners. The project was established to address a persistent 
market failure in the UK automotive sector where small technology developers lack the ability 
to meet the commercial and process demands of vehicle manufacturers. 

The proving factory will include two facilities: manufacturing and assembly. The facilities will 
be staffed by local workers, trained in the local area. The project is estimated to contribute 
£1 billion to UK growth by successfully industrialising UK developed green technologies and 
manufacturing them cost effectively in the UK, and will create over 1,200 new jobs. 

Improving the leadership and management capabilities of local businesses 

1.77 The Government also recognises the importance of improving the leadership and 
management capability of local businesses and believes that business schools have an important 
role to play. Growth Accelerator is already working closely with business schools to provide 
tailored support to strengthen leadership and management skills in high-growth potential 
businesses. Lord Young also encourages this and has asked the Association of Business Schools 
to lead a national programme, which recognises and encourages innovation and good practice 
in the relationship between business schools, their faculty and students, and local small 
businesses. The Government welcomes this initiative. 


     31 


Improving employment outcomes from the education and skills system 
1.78 Lord Heseltine’s review highlights the vital importance of the education system to the 
economy. The Government shares the goal of reforming England’s education and skills system 
to match the world’s best. By creating an autonomous education system, driven by high quality 
teaching and stretching qualifications, the Government will ensure that young people leave 
school and college with the knowledge and skills that make them ready to succeed in work and 
contribute to growth. In line with Lord Heseltine’s recommendations, the Government is: 

• challenging underperformance in schools, including providing a new role for the 
regional director of Ofsted in monitoring underperforming schools; 

• radically reforming post-16 vocational provision to ensure that students acquire 
rigorous qualifications with a clear progression route to employment or higher 
education;  

• placing a greater emphasis on longer-term outcomes of education – progression to 
higher education and employment – by publishing destination measures;  

• forging closer links between employers and education providers to open up 
students’ awareness of opportunities in local, national and international labour 
markets and develop essential skills for the work place;  

• publishing data to hold local authorities to account on reducing the numbers of 
young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs); and 

• ensuring businesses can recruit the skills they need from abroad including by 
streamlining UK immigration rules and reducing backlogs of migration cases. 

Challenging underperformance in schools 

1.79 The performance of many of the UK’s schools is world class. However, the Government 
strongly agrees that underperformance cannot go unchallenged. In England, Ofsted Inspectors 
focus sharply on those aspects of schools’ work that have the greatest impact on raising 
achievement, in particular, the achievement of pupils; the quality of teaching; the behaviour and 
safety of pupils and the quality of leadership in, and management of, the school. All schools 
that have either achieved poor examination results over a number of years; been judged by 
Ofsted to have serious weaknesses; or are judged as requiring special measures, are in scope to 
become sponsored academies. Quick progress will be made at these schools with heads, 
governors, sponsors, local authorities and central government all playing their part. The 
Secretary of State for Education can and does intervene where rapid progress is not being made. 
By the end of 2012, 200 of the worst performing primary schools were converted to sponsored 
Academies. 184 underperforming secondary schools are currently in the pipeline for becoming 
sponsored Academies. 

1.80 Lord Heseltine’s report concludes that Ofsted should have additional powers to intervene 
swiftly where there is underperformance. The Government has agreed that Ofsted should use its 
powers to increase monitoring of schools that are underperforming. This work is being led by 
regional directors in Ofsted, who will oversee teams of HM Inspectors. Ofsted is also currently 
consulting on a new framework to inspect local authorities on their school improvement 
functions. Furthermore, HM Chief Inspector at Ofsted has announced a programme of work 
between January and April 2013 in which Ofsted will undertake simultaneous inspections of 
weak schools in up to six local authority areas. This started with inspections in Derby and 
Portsmouth.  


    32  


Reforming vocational education 

1.81 High quality vocational education can play a vital role in developing young people’s 
leadership and management skills and preparing them for success in the workplace, as Lord 
Heseltine recognises in his report. The Government is radically reforming post-16 vocational 
provision through the introduction of 16-19 Study Programmes in response to Professor Alison 
Wolf’s Review of Vocational Education.31

1.82 From September 2013, funding for 16-19 education will shift from a per qualification to a 
per student basis allowing schools and colleges to offer their students personalised and 
stretching education programmes that have clear progression routes to employment or higher 
education. Work experience and work-related learning will be a core element of Vocational 
Study Programmes, and will include English and maths for those who have not yet achieved an 
A-C grade at GCSE. This directly responds to employers’ concerns that young people lack the 
employability skills, including literacy and numeracy, which are essential for the workplace. 


  

1.83 Further to this, the Government is proactively working with employer representatives to 
remove the barriers that deter some employers from offering work experience places. For 
example, the Government has successfully removed regulations requiring employers to carry out 
Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks on employees who supervise or work with students on 
work experience. The Government will continue to cut red tape and reduce the legislative 
burden on business to help increase the supply of work experience places.  

Improving progression from education into work 

1.84 The Government believes that young people’s progression into education or employment is 
a powerful measure of the success of educational institutions. In his report, Lord Heseltine 
recognised that the Department for Education has led the way in the creation of destination 
measures, which were published for the first time in July 2012. These are new pieces of 
information that parents and students can use in choosing between places to study, and provide 
an incentive to institutions to ensure that young people are able to progress. From 2013, the 
Government plans to include employment destinations in the data, giving a measure of how 
well institutions develop their students’ employability. In addition, for the first time, later this 
year, destination measures for 16 year olds will be incorporated in school performance tables. 
This is a significant development in England’s accountability regime, putting the onus on schools 
and colleges to consider the effectiveness of their provision in helping young people to develop 
and progress. 

1.85 It is also essential that young people are able to make informed choices about their options 
after leaving school or college. To help facilitate this, the Government is extending the 
requirement for schools to secure independent and impartial careers guidance for their pupils to 
cover ages 12-18 and applying a similar requirement to colleges through their funding 
agreements. 

Forging links between employers and the education system 

1.86 Employers can play a vital role in the preparation of students for the world of work, helping 
to raise their aspirations, increase their understanding and develop essential skills. The 
Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that schools, colleges and training providers should 
work more closely with the private sector and ensure that young people have the skills they need 
to thrive in employment or as entrepreneurs.  


 

31 Wolf Review of Vocational Education, Government Response, Department for Education, 2011 


     33 


1.87 The Government encourages direct employer links with schools, as a way of inspiring and 
informing young people. Lord Heseltine noted the benefits of new University Technical Colleges 
and Studio Schools in involving employers directly with the education system. Alongside these 
programmes, all schools can join successful free initiatives such as Inspiring the Future and 
Business Class, as well as local initiatives that aim to connect schools with the business world 
and capitalise on the expertise that employers can offer. LEPs and other local networks can 
facilitate this engagement. 

Box 1.E: Case study: Inspiring the Future initiative 

The Government is working with the Education and Employers Taskforce on ‘Inspiring the 
Future’. This scheme was launched in July 2012 and aims to recruit professionals to 
volunteer from a variety of sectors to give inspirational and informative talks about their 
careers to students in state schools. This gives young people the chance to gain valuable 
insights into different jobs and careers. The Government is leading by example in supporting 
the initiative by encouraging civil servants to take part in the scheme. 

1.88 As Lord Heseltine highlights, local employers also have an important role to play in school 
governance. It is essential that governing bodies are made up of people with the necessary skills 
and experience to enable them to carry out their demanding functions, including successful 
business people. The Government does not believe in dictating who sits on governing bodies but 
it agrees that business leaders should seek opportunities to get involved with school and college 
governance, and will continue to encourage business leaders to take advantage of the 
government-funded Governors’ One-Stop Shop, a free service which helps schools and colleges 
to recruit skilled governors from the business world. 

1.89 A skills system that is responsive to local needs can help drive economic growth. To ensure 
that local businesses can shape the pipeline of talent emerging from local further education (FE) 
institutions, at Autumn Statement 2012, the Government agreed that LEPs would have a new 
strategic influence over skills policy in accordance with Lord Heseltine’s analysis. LEPs will be 
responsible for setting local skills strategies and chartered status for FE colleges is now 
dependent upon having taken into account the skills priorities of local LEPs. The Government is 
reforming the delivery landscape so that employers have direct influence over qualifications and 
learning programmes and by ensuring that LEPs are represented strongly on college governing 
bodies. The Government will also encourage LEPs to have a seat on FE colleges’ governing 
bodies, with colleges also represented on LEP boards.  

1.90 The Government also fully agrees with Lord Heseltine that business and universities should 
have closer engagement to ensure courses are relevant and build employability skills. It is 
important for businesses and higher education institutions (HEIs) to take ownership and to 
develop collaboration in ways that best suit local skills priorities and characteristics. In line with 
Lord Heseltine’s recommendations, the Government is reforming the skills and higher education 
system to give businesses the power and responsibility to define the skills needs of their sectors 
and to work with HEIs to develop new ways to meet them: 

• the Government is rewarding universities that are most effective in business 
engagement through Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF) for English HEIs, 
which is being maintained at £150 million per-annum for 2011-15; 

• the Employer Ownership Pilot provides an opportunity for employers to work with 
partners to develop innovative approaches to meeting their skills needs. £340 


    34  


million has been provided up to 2015-16, with £90 million allocated in round one, 
attracting £115 million contribution from employers;  

• the Government is supporting the establishment of a National Centre for 
Universities and Business (NCUB), to gather evidence, bring together university and 
business leaders, support engagement between stakeholders and share best 
practice with graduate employability a key focus; and 

• sector councils that are being created by business in response to the Government’s 
industrial strategy will also focus on skills issues. 

Box 1.F: Case study: Hewlett Packard tailored degree courses 

Hewlett Packard (HP) works with a number of universities to provide HP-tailored degree 
courses. Staffordshire University recently announced an academic partnership with HP to 
help develop new IT degree courses and provide internships and mentoring for students. The 
partnership will help equip students with the attitudes, skills and essential attributes of 
employability, enterprise and entrepreneurship to secure a rewarding career in an 
increasingly global market. 

With operations in over 170 countries HP will not only provide Staffordshire University with 
IT technology and solutions, but will help facilitate global opportunities for students through 
its international network and partners. Staffordshire University and HP will also work to 
collaborate on research into areas such as networking, sustainability, information security 
and ‘cloud 7’.  

1.91 The Government also agrees with Lord Heseltine that the higher education system should 
equip graduates with skills that industries need and that there is a role for business to invest in 
those skills. Businesses, alongside HEIs, are already driving change. For example, KPMG has 
developed an innovative new programme to broaden access into the accountancy profession. 
The scheme enables young school leavers to gain work experience, an accounting degree from 
leading universities, such as Durham, Exeter and Birmingham, and a professional accountancy 
qualification, with all tuition fees paid by KPMG and a starting salary in the region of £20,000. 
Furthermore, the National Centre for Universities and Business has been formed as a single focus 
for information on business–university collaboration. 

Supporting young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs) 

1.92 The Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that youth unemployment should be a priority 
for every area and that action to support young people NEET is best taken at a local level. Local 
authorities are already under duties to ensure that all NEET young people are supported into 
education or training. The Government will be publishing more data more often to hold local 
authorities to account for the delivery of these duties. Local authorities are able to access funding 
to meet these duties through central government grants. These grants are not ring-fenced in 
order to allow maximum flexibility for local authorities. In the future, the Government will 
consider the role of LEPs in supporting this work as part of decisions taken on the Single Local 
Growth Fund in the Spending Round later this year. 

Ensuring businesses can recruit the skills they need from abroad 

1.93 The UK welcomes the best and brightest from abroad with skills that are crucial to UK 
growth. But the Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that more can be done to step up 
engagement with business to ensure they understand the Government’s rules on skilled worker 


     35 


immigration. The Government is working in consultation with business users to develop an easy-
to-use pre-application guide to the sponsorship process and a programme of outreach events to 
inform and reassure businesses about compliance issues. The UK Border Agency (UKBA) holds 
regular focus groups with business and has established a business user forum chaired by the 
Confederation of British Industry. 

1.94 The Government currently reviews its immigration rules at least every five years to assess 
their effectiveness and whether their objectives could be achieved with less regulation. But, the 
Government is putting in train a programme of work to identify opportunities for improvement. 
As a first step, UKBA will be carrying out a review of how the application and enforcement of 
immigration rules in relation to skilled and highly skilled migrants can be improved. This review 
will include involvement by UKBA’s Business User Forum and will report internally to Lord Taylor. 
Following on from this, other areas, such as the visit visa arrangements, will be identified for 
review. As an additional step towards ensuring immigration law is fit for purpose the Home 
Office will be working with business and stakeholders, including the Immigration Law 
Practitioners Association, to review the structure and format of the immigration rules under the 
Open Policy Making initiative.  

1.95 The Government shares Lord Heseltine’s ambition to clear historic backlogs of cases while 
dealing with new cases efficiently and effectively. The UKBA is using temporary staff to speed up 
processing and tackle delays. In addition, UKBA recently deployed 1,000 existing employees to 
the frontline to ensure it can continue to target backlogs and is making progress in this area: in 
November 2012, UKBA closed the controlled archive of old asylum cases and is now working 
through the Migration Refusals Pool. Alongside this, UKBA is working to ensure those that have 
no right to be in the UK either leave or do not enter the UK in the first place. Overseas, UKBA 
has ambitious plans to increase the number of interviews in the coming year and, in-country, it 
is improving enforcement performance through closer working with other agencies. It is 
continuing to make best use of the detention estate by working with other partners in the 
justice system. It is bringing together all existing removals resource nationally into a centralised 
National Removals Command. 

Implementation 
1.96 It is important to make sure these commitments are fully implemented. This will require the 
right cross-Whitehall machinery to be in place to ensure effective working between all relevant 
departments. The Government will also use regular ministerial implementation meetings to 
monitor and provide effective challenge and leadership.

2 Unleashing potential: Local Growth Deals 


 

A vision for local growth 
2.1 The Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that there is a powerful case for increased 
devolution of economic powers away from central government. Just as strong local leadership is 
what made the UK successful in the past it also has the potential to transform our 
competitiveness in the present. This response is about enabling that: giving places the autonomy 
and encouragement they need to build growth.  

2.2 The Government has already taken action to help bring this ambition to life, including:  

• promoting the establishment of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) – 39 strategic 
partnerships between local business leaders, local authority leaders and other partners; 

• allowing the local retention of business rates – incentivising local areas to prioritise 
growth and keep 50 per cent of the proceeds; 

• creating the Growing Places Fund and the Regional Growth Fund – providing 
support to LEPs and local authorities for local projects and programmes; 

• introducing City Deals – negotiating bespoke deals with cities and their LEPs to give 
them the powers and tools they need to drive local economic growth; 

• establishing Enterprise Zones – areas around the country that support both new and 
expanding businesses by offering incentives, creating local jobs and growth; and 

• removing £7 billion of ring-fences from local government at Spending Review 2010. 

2.3 Now is the time for a step change to further erode the excessive centralisation that shackles 
local ambition and creativity. This response implements Lord Heseltine’s key recommendation 
and commits to creating a Single Local Growth Fund in England from April 2015, and devolving 
responsibilities, influence and growth-related spending on the basis of strategic plans developed 
by LEPs. 

2.4 The Government wants every place to be able to fulfil its potential for growth, unleashing 
enterprise and bringing jobs and prosperity to communities. The first wave of City Deals has 
shown what places can do if Whitehall gives them control. Local areas will get new levers to 
help them do this, but they must also take responsibility for decisions, and look beyond narrow 
local authority boundaries to plan strategically over true functional economic geographies. They 
must innovate and take calculated risks based on their knowledge of how their local economy 
functions and where the opportunities for future growth lie. 

2.5 The Government therefore proposes to devolve resource and responsibility to those places 
which can demonstrate credible and compelling economic leadership. Local areas will receive 
powers and budgets previously held nationally in order to pursue local priorities, and local leaders 
will take on accountability for economic outcomes. Funding and flexibility will reflect the quality of 
the strategic proposals put forward by LEPs, the commitment of local authorities to work more 
efficiently and effectively across the LEP area, as well as local need.  


    38  


2.6 The Government will support areas in building their strategic economic planning capacity so 
they are able to take advantage of these new levers, whilst ensuring that LEPs remain small, 
strategic, business-led organisations.  

2.7 The Single Local Growth Fund applies to England only, reflecting the fact that economic 
development is devolved to the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern 
Ireland Executive. The funding that will form the Single Local Growth Fund would have been 
allocated in England only.  

Principles for effective partnership 
2.8 The Government believes that every part of the system has a role to play in unlocking 
growth, and the best outcomes will be achieved by central government, LEPs and local 
authorities working together. 

Central government 

2.9 To this end, the Government will: 

• devolve increasing resources and responsibilities to areas to empower them to 
deliver growth; 

• support all areas to increase their capacity to take on this new challenge; 

• remove central ring-fences to allow greater local pooling of resources and 
collaboration across an economic area; 

• work with local areas to establish reasonable transparency and evaluation processes 
that are proportional to the size and scale of the funding that is devolved and the 
capacity of an area; and 

• ensure coherence between the Single Local Growth Fund and existing initiatives. 

2.10 The Government will not: 

• burden LEPs with competing priorities from the centre or introduce new local 
growth initiatives that need to be implemented in a different way. 

Local Enterprise Partnerships 

2.11 In 2010, the Government invited local areas to come forward with proposals for LEPs. 39 
were approved on the basis of support from the business community and local authorities, and 
that their coverage represented a significant functional economic geography. The Government 
agrees with Lord Heseltine that local businesses and council leaders are best placed to set the 
strategic direction for an area, which is why LEPs (who bring these key actors together) will be 
asked by the Government to lead the development of strategic plans for local growth, consistent 
with national priorities. 

2.12 LEPs will: 

• remain high level, business-led, strategic bodies, bringing together local leaders  
and businesses; 


     39 


• shape priorities within an area by leading the development of a strategic plan, 
including as part of this an investment strategy for EU Structural and Investment 
Funds (the EU SI Funds);1

• consult with all relevant local actors in compiling their strategic plan – including 
local businesses, local business groups, universities, further education colleges and 
local community groups;  


  

• retain the right to review their boundaries in light of experience and the increased 
responsibilities that will be placed on them; and 

• strengthen links with their constituent local authorities, and look to their local 
authority members to deliver the LEP strategy and EU SI Funds investment strategy. 

2.13 LEPs will not: 

• become unwieldy bureaucracies. 

Local authorities 

2.14 Local authorities will: 

• use these new levers to enable them to prioritise growth alongside service delivery; 

• support the LEP(s) they are part of, and demonstrate their commitment to making 
collective strategic decisions, including delivering the agreed investment plans and 
delivering efficiencies;  

• pool strategic economic development spend and functions, and support LEPs in 
securing match funding for EU SI Funds; 

• co-ordinate land use planning functions and align adopted local plans, including 
the use of Local Development Orders, across local authorities in a LEP area;  

• manage and account for the localised funds through binding and long lived 
decision making structures such as a joint leaders committee as a minimum, or 
combined authority (preferable), or other similar arrangement; and 

• collect and report publicly on key economic development metrics and conduct 
evaluations. 


 

1 These are the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development 
(EAFRD), and the European Maritime and Fisheries Funds (EMFF). They have been previously referred to as the Common Strategic Framework Funds.

Box 2.B: Examples of effective joint working 

LEPs have been in existence for a relatively short time, but there are already powerful 
examples of what local business leadership and strong partnerships across local authorities 
can deliver. For example: 

• Sheffield City Region LEP is establishing a combined authority. This will create a 
strong, stable and effective governance structure across the area. It will support 
strategic decision-making and resource pooling across the authorities in the LEP.   

• The Black Country LEP has worked with all local authorities in its area to develop a 
single, consistent approach to dealing with planning applications. All local 
authorities will now unify the supporting documents needed. 

• Leeds City Region LEP has agreed on a joint procurement framework for major 
construction projects designed to cut red tape reducing costs and processing 
time. 

• Cornwall and Isles of Scilly LEP has led public and private sector partners in 
identifying key transport priorities. The top priority has been to seek a solution to 
dualling the 2.8 mile Temple to Higher Carblake section of the A30, removing a 
bottleneck. The Department for Transport provided £30 million at Autumn 
Statement 2012, with Cornwall Council expecting wider economic benefits in 
excess of £117 million. 

A blueprint for the future 
2.15 The UK economy needs all places to fulfil their potential in order to be competitive in the 
global race. The aim at the heart of these proposals is to devolve meaningful power and funding 
through a negotiation, using competitive tension to ensure there are real incentives for growth. 
However, the Government recognises the differences between places, including in the form and 
capacity of LEPs as they currently exist. To that end, the Government wants to introduce a new 
framework for local economic development that can respond flexibly to current circumstances 
and to changes in capacity and ambition over time.  

2.16 The proposed design outlined below represents the Government’s vision for giving local 
areas the power they need to effect change, including the creation of a Single Local Growth 
Fund and influence over other important funding streams. Paragraph 2.46 onwards will outline 
the process to April 2015 in more detail. 

Creating a Single Local Growth Fund 

2.17 Lord Heseltine set out a compelling vision of a decentralised approach to local economic 
growth, breaking Whitehall’s monopoly on power forever. As part of this, he proposed the 
pooling of funding for economic growth from central government departments, without ring-
fences, which could be used flexibly to meet local priorities. The entire fund would be flexible 
across geographies and policy areas. 

2.18 The Government shares Lord Heseltine’s view of the need to pursue a radical approach to 
decentralisation, and believes in giving business-led LEPs the power to make the choices that are 
right for their local economies. The Single Local Growth Fund is a significant prize for local 
areas, both in terms of funding and flexibilities on offer. The Government believes that LEPs and 
local leaders are best placed to understand the opportunities and barriers to growth in their 
areas, and to overcome the functional silos of Whitehall.  


    42  


2.19 At Autumn Statement 2012, the Government set out its commitment to a Single Local 
Growth Fund, and Lord Heseltine identified a number of funding streams that could be included 
in it. All of these will be considered carefully with the following criteria in mind:  

• whether national or local decision-making best achieves the desired outcomes;  

• whether there are significant national level economies of scale or scope, that clearly 
outweigh any potential efficiency gains from devolution;  

• whether there is clear evidence that spillovers and allocative efficiency gains operate 
predominantly at national not local level;  

• whether there is clear evidence that there are no efficiency gains to be realised from 
enabling greater local tailoring and coordination of service provision; and 

• whether there is a significant risk of moral hazard from sub-national decision making. 

2.20 Full details of the size and content of the Single Local Growth Fund will be announced 
alongside the Spending Round later this year. There are three areas which the Government sees 
as critical to the success of the Single Local Growth Fund: transport, housing and skills. The 
Single Local Growth Fund must include elements of all three budgets if it is to give local areas 
influence over the levers that matter for growth. As part of the Spending Round, the 
Government will also review all the other funding streams that Lord Heseltine identified and will 
seek further alignment between skills and employment programmes. The Government will also 
ensure that the EU SI Funds are aligned with the Single Local Growth Fund. 

2.21 The Government believes that there is a very strong case for elements of the transport 
budget, such as the funding for major local transport schemes, to be included as such spending 
is integral to economic development. The Government has already begun to devolve this 
funding in a way that aligns with LEPs. The Government will build on the work which has been 
done so far, and ensure a smooth transition between the ongoing devolution process and the 
Heseltine reforms, so that the Government can move seamlessly towards integrating transport 
funding into the Single Local Growth Fund. The Government therefore expects all Local 
Transport Bodies (LTBs) to maintain momentum and continue to develop their assurance 
frameworks and provisional programmes of schemes. 

2.22 Likewise, housing plays a key role in the local economy and the Government expects that 
some housing funding will be included in the Single Local Growth Fund to enable integrated 
decisions on housing, planning and transport solutions that maximise local growth. 

2.23 The Government is reforming the skills system, looking at ways to put more control in the 
hands of employers and trainees rather than providers, such as through the Employer Ownership 
Pilot, Advanced Learning Loans and the response to the Richard Review. LEPs can play a crucial 
part in this, ensuring that local provision meets the needs of local employers and trainees and 
building much stronger links with the business community. It is important to continue the focus 
on transferring control to employers and maintain a nationally funded apprenticeship system. 
However, the Government believes that including an element of skills funding within the Single 
Local Growth Fund is important in order to give LEPs the ability to influence provision, 
particularly for local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). 

2.24 As there are very close links between employment and skills programmes, the Government 
will examine closely the options for aligning employment support programmes with LEPs and 
the Single Local Growth Fund. For those employment support programmes which are currently 
UK-wide, we will work with the devolved administrations to consider the best approach for 
managing the funding streams in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  


     43 


2.25 Work will continue ahead of the Spending Round to determine what within these funding 
streams should be included in the Single Local Growth Fund, and to assess the case for the 
other funding streams Lord Heseltine highlighted. This is in the context of the Government’s 
priority to reduce the deficit and ensure the public finances remain stable. This will inevitably 
require tough choices, including across those areas where funding will be transferred to the 
Single Local Growth Fund. 

2.26 There are some funding streams where the principles set out above point strongly to the 
majority of spend continuing at a national level. This is certainly the case for innovation funding, 
where specialisation not duplication is essential. For example, concentrating resources on 
creating national centres of excellence that are globally competitive, such as the National 
Composites Centre in Bristol. But where local areas can make a case that they could deliver 
better results if the funding was devolved, the Government will listen. 

Box 2.C: Local Authority Transport Majors  

In September 2012, following a period of consultation, the Department for Transport set out 
its proposals for the devolution of funding for local major transport schemes from 2015. 

In January 2013, the Department for Transport provided each LTB with an indicative 
population-based funding level but was clear that these figures were purely assumptions to 
be used for planning purposes. They are based on the total amount of funding for local 
major schemes in the Spending Review 2010, distributed between LTBs on the basis of 
population (2017 forecast). The actual allocations will be determined in future Spending 
Rounds. 

The Department for Transport was clear in the guidance issued that there was a need to be 
responsive to evolving agendas, particularly in relation to the Government’s response to the 
Heseltine Review. However, the planning for new schemes and programmes cannot be 
delayed if the Government is to maintain the momentum of new infrastructure that is to vital 
to the economy. The Government therefore expect all LTBs to continue developing their 
assurance frameworks and provisional programmes of schemes. 

2.27 The new Single Local Growth Fund represents only part of the picture: LEPs will have 
strategic influence over a much broader set of resources. For example, some of the significant 
amount of spending by local authorities on economic development could be pooled or spent 
alongside LEP budgets.2

2.28 The Government is also taking this opportunity to streamline its management of the EU SI 
Funds. The final budget for these funds has yet to be agreed by the European Parliament. The 
Government will work with the devolved administrations to make allocations to areas across the UK. 

 To support this, Government has also announced it is allowing local 
authorities access to cheaper borrowing, through the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB), for a local 
priority infrastructure project nominated by each LEP to a total of £1.5 billion of borrowing 
(excluding London). The PWLB project rate will be introduced from 1 November 2013 and the 
Government is publishing details of what LEPs need to do to access this new rate alongside this 
response.  

2.29 A significant proportion of England’s share of the EU SI Funds will be notionally allocated 
to LEPs. While these funds cannot be included in the Single Local Growth Fund due to European 


 

2 The Government does not hold a detailed breakdown of the amount of local authority expenditure which supports strategic economic development.  
It will however include some proportion of capital expenditure by local government on services such as transport and housing, which in 2011-12 
totalled just over £20 billion. 


    44  


funding rules, they will sit alongside the Single Local Growth Fund, and LEP investment 
strategies for EU SI Funds should be aligned with the LEP strategic plans. EU SI Funds require 
match funding, and, while some of this will come from government (and the Single Local 
Growth Fund) it will be important to ensure as far as possible that there is match funding from 
the private sector. LEPs, with a business leadership, will be well placed to deliver this. 

Box 2.D: The Greater Birmingham Project 

Following the publication of No Stone Unturned, the Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP 
approached Lord Heseltine and asked him if he would work with them to explore the 
opportunities that could arise in the Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP area if the 
economic recommendations in No Stone Unturned were implemented. 

The resulting Greater Birmingham Project, published on 17 March, shows the potential for 
substantial benefits that could be achieved if the recommendations are accepted. The report 
cites 10 ‘Big Ideas’ that would only be possible with enhanced local control and flexibilities 
over the resources for economic growth, including delivery of the M42 Economic Gateway, 
sector growth acceleration, driving up skills by improving links between businesses and 
schools and an integrated approach to unlocking growth in priority communities.  

The report makes a strong case for changes to the present system, both locally and 
nationally. It also recognises that changes to local governance are needed, and sets out the 
LEP’s intention to establish a Supervisory Board of local authority leaders to provide over-
sight and democratic accountability. The Greater Birmingham Project will provide the 
framework for the Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP’s strategic plan.  

Growth Deals 

2.30 The allocation of the Single Local Growth Fund and any flexibilities will be through a 
process of negotiation, where areas can make their case and central government can 
understand the capacity and governance that underpin local plans. There must also be 
competitive tension, to strengthen incentives on LEPs and their partners to unleash local areas to 
generate growth, and drive collaboration, creativity, commitment and ambition. Allocations to 
LEPs from an un-ring-fenced single Fund will drive efficiencies and ensure funding delivers the 
greatest benefits across the country. The Government expects that every LEP would receive 
something from this process, but the exact offer will depend on the quality of individual LEP 
plans. 

2.31 At Autumn Statement 2012, the Government announced that LEPs will be expected to 
develop a strategic growth plan consistent with national priorities. In developing the plans, LEPs 
and local authority members will be expected to work with all relevant local partners, including 
the local chambers of commerce, other business bodies and the wider business community. 
These multi-year plans will provide investment confidence for businesses and local authorities 
and build on any existing plans the local area has. They will also link up with ongoing public 
programmes, for example existing City Deals or Enterprise Zones. It is expected that local 
authorities or other bodies, and not LEPs themselves, will deliver programmes and projects, 
ensuring that there are proper democratic and financial accountability structures in place. 

2.32 This plan will be the basis on which the Government negotiates deals with each LEP for 
new levers, resources and flexibility over them. It needs to set out the LEP’s vision, rationale, 
priorities, capacity and governance (including governance arrangements across its constituent 
local authority members). It will also include a high-level investment plan setting out anticipated 
activities and associated investment, as well as resources available from both local authorities 


     45 


and the private sector. LEPs will be asked to work with local authorities to put in place bespoke 
approaches to land use planning, including the use of Local Development Orders or other means 
to simplify the planning process for economically important projects. 

2.33 All plans should include milestones and anticipated outcomes. These plans will take on 
different forms and emphases to reflect local priorities. Any plan will need a strong analytical 
base, driven by evidence of what works, and should exploit the potential for economic growth 
across the whole area served. This will not become a process of micro-management, so the 
emphasis will be on governance, capability, strategy and growth. 

2.34 Following submission of a plan, there will be a period of negotiation and discussion 
between each individual LEP and central government (see Box 2.E for assessment criteria). An 
iterative approach will allow central government to support both tried and tested proposals, and 
more innovative ideas where they have genuine potential. Those areas with the best plans will 
receive more from the Single Local Growth Fund. The iterative process will help to mitigate the 
risk of local areas missing out on greater benefits due to a lack of understanding of the 
assessment process or criteria. 

2.35 The LEP plan (including governance arrangements) will be assessed with the unique 
characteristics of the local area in mind and will inform decisions on the final level of the 
resources, levers and flexibilities allocated to a place. Looking at plans in this way will help to 
reflect the variability between areas. Given the defined nature of the Single Local Growth Fund, 
these discussions will happen over a set timeframe with final decisions taken at a single point. 
The timing of these discussions will be specified at the Spending Round later this year. There 
could also be discussions on further powers, freedoms and influence over government activity 
and spending outside the Single Local Growth Fund.  

2.36 Over time, an incentive element could be introduced to reward those that deliver on their 
plans and achieve real economic benefits, and past performance will be taken into account 
when the Government considers future allocations. 


    46  


Box 2.E: Negotiations would consider a number of criteria including, for example: 

• strength of plans for effective pooling of economic development spend and 
functions across the LEP area, including the degree to which these funds will be 
revolving, what private sector leverage has also been secured and whether there is 
a co-ordinated approach to strategic spatial planning;  

• clarity of prioritisation of key strategic projects and vision for the area, based on 
the LEP’s and local leaders’ understanding of the area’s competitive advantage, 
and unique combination of strengths and challenges, including how this fits with 
national growth priorities; 

• level of ambition demonstrated by bottom-up plans and targets for leveraging 
investment and for additional outputs and outcomes;  

• strength of evidence of deliverability, including skills and resources of the LEP, and 
the level of support and commitment of wider partners;  

• the strength of governance arrangements in place, including the decision making 
structures for local authorities, such as a combined authority, and for joint LEP 
and local authority decision-making on spend; and 

• plans for transparent publication of data on key quantitative metrics such as 
increase in job numbers, Gross Value Added and commercial floorspace, and for 
formal evaluation. 

Accountability  

2.37 Devolution of economic leadership and growth funding to local leaders offers an important 
opportunity to strengthen local democratic and financial accountability.  

2.38  Councils, working closely with the LEPs they are part of, will take on increasing levels of 
accountability to voters on determining economic development priorities, designing 
interventions, managing additional public money and delivering growth. Decisions on strategic 
issues and major investment projects will be made by LEPs and their local authority members 
and delivered or commissioned by local authorities. Funds will be paid to either a lead local 
authority or to a combined authority. Accountability to the wider business community is also 
provided through the LEP. The involvement of senior local politicians provides a strong and 
direct link back to local people. 

2.39 Governance must be robust, proportionate and transparent, and should draw on the 
recommendations in the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) report 
Accountability: Adapting to decentralisation.3 Departmental accounting officers are responsible 
for assuring Parliament that local spending financed by government grants meets high 
standards, including delivering value for money. To do this there must be a robust local 
accountability system in place, with local Section 151 officers4

2.40 The Government will need assurance that taxpayers’ money is being spent well. This is why 
negotiation on the strategic plan will be iterative, and the decision on both amount and 

 and democratically elected 
councillors responsible for ensuring that public money is managed with propriety and regularity, 
and value for money.  


 

3 Accountability: Adapting to decentralisation, Department for Communities and Local Government, September 2011 
4 Under Section 151 of the 1972 Local Government Act, ‘every local authority shall make arrangements for the proper administration of their financial 
affairs, and shall secure that one of their officers (known as the section 151 officer or chief finance officer) has responsibility for the administration of 
those affairs.’ 


     47 


flexibilities that each area will receive will be bespoke. Specifically, where places have not yet 
made the transition to effective governance and joint working across the LEP area, there will be 
central controls on how the Single Local Growth Fund can be spent, based on the strategic plan 
and discussion process described above, and a greater emphasis on central monitoring and 
evaluation. 

Reforming local and central government in support of localism 

2.41 Lord Heseltine recommended that the new requirements for LEPs to produce a strategic 
plan, as well as the decentralisation of funding through the Single Local Growth Fund, should 
require local authorities to radically re-engineer how they promote growth and deliver services. 
To prioritise growth effectively authorities will need to come together across the functional 
economic area represented by the LEP, pooling resources and functions. In parallel, local 
authorities will also need to maximise the efficiency of their service delivery.  

2.42 The Government shares Lord Heseltine’s view of a future where local authorities put 
economic development at the heart of all they do:  

• collaborating, including with private sector partners across a functional  
economic area;  

• combining their operations for service delivery, including with other public and 
private sector service providers; and 

• building strong and accountable leadership, including, where they want this, a 
leader elected by the people of that economic area.  

2.43 The Government will legislate as necessary to make this all possible, but does not intend to 
impose additional duties on local authorities. 

2.44 The Government has therefore committed to support local authorities that wish to create a 
combined authority or implement other forms of collaboration (for example, shared 
management), including ensuring that the existing legislation is fit for purpose. The Government 
also accepts Lord Heseltine’s recommendation for conurbation mayors and intends, at the next 
available opportunity, to seek legislation for such mayors where the authorities want this, as well 
as for any other provision necessary to make the existing legislation fit for purpose. Lord 
Heseltine also recommended that all local authorities should hold whole council elections every 
four years. The Government has already made it easier for local authorities to do this through 
the Localism Act 2011, and, whilst leaving this for local choice, the Government welcomes the 
adoption anywhere of four-yearly whole council elections. 

2.45 Lord Heseltine saw the pursuit of unitary status as being a significant step towards the 
future he wanted. While the Government will not stand in the way of areas that would like to 
voluntarily adopt this approach where this would unambiguously result in greater efficiencies, 
the Government believes it would be preferable for authorities not to be distracted by structural 
change but to focus on coming together to share their operations both across frontline service 
delivery and back office. To incentivise and facilitate the development of such combined 
arrangements the Government announced in February 2013, a £9.2 million Transformation 
Challenge Award to support those local authorities which are at the cutting edge of innovation 
in developing such arrangements.

Box 2.F: An example of LEP areas improving governance 

In the North East LEP area, the seven local authorities have already formed a Leadership 
Board to further deepen collaboration on economic and transport policy. The Leadership 
Board has now resolved to create a statutory body within the legislative framework for 
combined authorities by 2014. Working with the business, further education and higher 
education members of the North East LEP Board, this body will lead a shared vision for 
economic growth in the area, with transport and skills as areas of immediate priority. The 
Government welcomes this development and looks forward to working with the new 
statutory body to devolve resources over time. 

Next steps 
2.46 The world outlined in this chapter is a very different place from the world today, and local 
authorities, LEPs and central government will all need to make significant changes to the way 
they operate to realise this vision together. We envisage a progressive process in which freedoms 
and flexibilities on economic development are gradually devolved to areas as local leaders take 
on and grow into their new responsibilities. What this document announces is the start of a 
journey. The Government expects to build on it as the capacity, ambition and experience of local 
areas grows. 

Capacity building  

2.47 The period between now and April 2015 will be a critical time for local areas to get 
themselves ready to take on their new roles. The Government is supporting LEPs to boost capacity 
and enable them to carry out their new responsibilities, while ensuring that they remain small, 
strategic, business-led organisations with strong support from their partner local authorities. 

2.48 The Government has already offered £10 million core funding to all LEPs (£250,000 per LEP 
per year), to be matched locally by partners. This will provide important core support for the LEP 
board to drive forward their partnership priorities. Autumn Statement 2012 announced a further 
£250,000 per LEP per year for LEPs to develop their strategic plans. This additional funding will 
also be used by LEPs to develop their EU SI Funds investment strategies from April 2013. 

2.49 In recognition of the key role envisaged for LEPs in transport, the Department for Transport 
provided an additional £5 million to LEPs in 2012-13. Although LEPs will have discretion on the 
use of this funding, it is hoped that it will improve their capacity to play a leading role in 
transport, including participation in LTBs (see Box 2.C).  

Box 2.G: Supporting LEP development 

BIS Local has worked with the Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire (D2N2) LEP, 
Nottingham City Council, the Homes and Communities Agency and Boots Healthcare to 
negotiate the financial and legal arrangements to secure a £25 million investment to unlock 
the infrastructure requirements on the Nottingham Enterprise Zone. 

2.50 As centres of innovation and knowledge in a local area universities can play an important 
part in driving growth and 35 of the 39 LEPs have a university on their Board. Building on the 
Wilson Review of Business-University Collaboration published in February 2012, the Government 
has asked Sir Andrew Witty, CEO of Glaxo Smith Kline and Chancellor of Nottingham University, to 
lead a review to explore how universities can support LEPs and other local actors to drive growth 


     49 


in their area and to disseminate best practice. This will report to the Secretary of State for Business, 
Innovation and Skills and the Economic Affairs Committee of Cabinet in the summer. 

2.51 Local relationship management and support is provided for LEPs and local authorities from 
BIS Local and the Department for Communities and Local Government. The Government has 
now also put in place senior Whitehall sponsors for each LEP (drawn from across economic 
departments) to carry out high level engagement, to offer a strategic challenge to LEP areas and 
act as champion for the LEP area across Whitehall. The Government recognises that it needs to 
do more to mobilise its own resources at a local level behind LEPs’ growth priorities, offering 
coherent support across the range of departmental interests and activities that affect LEPs’ 
ability to deliver their vision for growth. To this end, we will be enhancing the arrangements in 
place for cross-departmental working through the development of Local Growth Teams, so that 
senior Whitehall sponsors can deploy these resources more effectively in co-ordinated support of 
LEPs. 

2.52 In looking forward to their enhanced role LEPs and local authorities will wish to take stock 
of their capability and consider where their partnership needs to build capacity. 

Box 2.H: What Works Centre 

The What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth will analyse, synthesise and disseminate the 
evidence relating to interventions that promote local economic growth. The primary customers 
for the outputs of the centre will be decision makers and practitioners working in, and with, LEPs 
and local authorities, who are responsible for the generation and use of evidence.  

The tendering process opened on 4 March 2013 and the deadline for applications closes on 25 
April 2013, with a decision expected to be announced in July. The Centre will have core 
funding of £1 million per annum over an initial three year term, jointly funded by the 
Economic and Social Research Council (50 per cent), the Department for Business, Innovation 
and Skills and the Department for Communities and Local Government (both 25 per cent). 

Progressive transition to 2015 

2.53 In this context, the Government envisages a progressive transition towards substantial 
devolution of economic development funding by 2015-16. 

2.54 Some cities, notably London, already benefit from additional flexibilities in relation to 
economic development. These additional flexibilities will not be affected whilst the Government 
seeks to implement the Single Local Growth Fund. 

2.55 The Government also views the City Deals process as the start of the dialogue on the move to 
a Single Local Growth Fund. We will draw on the process that has encouraged collaboration for 
wider economic benefit in exchange for greater freedoms – both within and without the 28 areas 
that already have a deal or been invited to negotiate one. This means that every LEP will have a 
similar discussion by the end of this parliament and will ensure that no place gets left behind. 

2.56 In addition to growth, the health of local economies also requires reforms to local public 
services to deliver better outcomes at lower costs, and the Government is committed to 
spreading innovation from the Whole Place Community Budget pilots to support other places. 

2.57 From April 2013, the Government will begin implementation of its delivery model for the 
EU SI Funds for the 2014-2020 period in England, with strategic decision-making devolved to 
LEP areas (see below). Spending of EU SI Funds will likely begin in mid-2014, and the funds will 
therefore provide a useful ‘head-start’ for the Single Local Growth Fund ahead of April 2015. 


    50  


2.58 The Spending Round scheduled for 26 June 2013 will set departmental budgets for 2015-
16 and will determine the size of funding streams transferred to the first Single Local Growth 
Fund. This is an important milestone in realising the Government’s ambitions, although beyond 
2015-16 the Government agrees with Lord Heseltine that areas need certainty over funding 
amounts over a longer time horizon in order to plan strategically for growth. 

EU Structural and Investment Funds (the EU SI Funds) 

2.59 The Government agrees with Lord Heseltine’s recommendation to streamline its 
management of EU SI Funds in England, reduce the number of programmes and associated 
bureaucracy, and align local allocations from the funds with the Single Local Growth Fund.  

2.60 The ERDF, the ESF and part of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development 
(EAFRD), which is specifically directed at rural areas, will be brought together into an ‘EU SI 
Funds Growth Programme’ with a streamlined governance structure. The Growth Programme’s 
top priorities are innovation, research and development, support for SMEs, low carbon, skills, 
employment and social inclusion. The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be aligned with 
the Growth Programme, and available to LEPs on a competitive basis. 

2.61 The large majority of the funds in the EU SI Funds Growth Programme will be notionally 
allocated to LEP areas. The allocations will be confirmed after the EU Budget for 2014-2020 has 
been agreed between the European Parliament and Member States. 

2.62 Each LEP will lead the development of an EU SI Funds investment strategy, which will form 
part of, and align with, the LEP’s strategic plan. The LEP’s EU SI Funds investment strategy will 
need to cover the whole LEP area. In developing its investment strategy, the LEP will work with 
and reflect the interests of a broad range of economic, social and environmental partners, 
including businesses, civil society, rural partners and further and higher education institutes. LEPs 
will also be encouraged to collaborate with other LEPs which have similar thematic priorities in 
order to maximise impact. 

2.63 LEP EU SI Funds investment strategies will identify local sources of public and private sector 
match funding investment, including the Single Local Growth Fund, where this is needed. They 
will also set out where LEPs wish to take advantage of sources of national match funding. 

2.64 In order to assist LEPs in the development of their EU SI Funds investment strategies, the 
Government will issue initial guidance at the end of March 2013.This initial guidance will be 
developed further, in collaboration with LEPs and their partners, with a view to issuing detailed 
guidance in the summer of 2013. 

2.65 LEPs will be supported by local teams from the Department for Communities and Local 
Government, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs (the Managing Authority departments for ERDF, ESF and EAFRD respectively) 
and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in the development of their EU SI Funds 
investment strategies throughout 2013. LEPs will be asked to submit the first drafts of their 
strategies to the Government in the autumn of 2013 with the final versions being submitted in 
January 2014. 

2.66 After EU SI Funds investment strategies have been agreed with Government in early 2014, 
LEPs and their partners will implement them. Managing Authority departments and key delivery 
partners will continue to undertake the day-to-day administration of the funds in a simplified 
and streamlined way. 

2.67 The UK will be obliged by EU regulation to meet spending and performance targets 
throughout the 2014-2020 programme period. The Government plans to review the 


     51 


implementation of each LEP’s EU SI Funds investment strategy in 2017 and 2019. If any LEPs are 
not able to deliver their agreed targets then funding may be redistributed to make best use of it. 

2.68 LEPs will draw on the additional £250,000 given to them by the Government from April 
2013 to build the capacity and capability they will need to develop their EU SI Funds investment 
strategies in 2013. This recognises the significant overlap and alignment between development 
of EU SI Funds strategies and Single Local Growth Fund strategic plans. To support LEPs in the 
implementation of their EU SI Funds investment strategies in 2014-2020, the Managing 
Authority departments will look at how Technical Assistance from the SIF Growth Programme 
can be used to assist LEPs and local partners. 

LEP geography  

2.69 The Government upholds the principle that the determination of LEP boundaries rests with 
local partnerships. Business and civic leaders are best placed to understand how their local 
labour markets and their economies work in practice and where there are important linkages 
that cross shared local authority and other LEP boundaries. This approach to LEP boundaries has 
resulted in a number of overlaps and varying scales of LEP areas; this reflects economic reality. 
37 local authorities are in more than one LEP.  

2.70 LEPs have developed significant flexibility and innovation in partnership and collaborative 
working. Where there are overlaps in geography or where an economic opportunity spans more 
than one LEP area, pragmatic solutions have been agreed which work on the ground. For 
example there is joint work between Leeds City Region LEP and York, North Yorkshire and East 
Riding LEP to capture the economic benefits from the 2015 Tour de France which will start in 
Yorkshire. Solent and Enterprise M3 have drawn a notional boundary across the overlapping 
districts reflecting the distinctive economic geographies; this means that any overlap is an 
administrative one only. Further, LEPs or districts with a shared focus, even if they represent 
opposite corners of the country, are invited to work together where it makes sense to do so. 

2.71 In a small number of cases since their inception, LEPs have amended their original 
boundaries. The Government will not stand in their way if, in the light of experience and their 
enhanced role, LEPs want to make further changes, subject to support from business, from civic 
leaders and an assessment that this represents a significant functional economic area.  

Conclusion 
2.72 The Government recognises that the plan set out above is the first step towards a new model 
of local economic growth. The Government will be setting out further details at the Spending 
Round, and would welcome views from any interested parties.

Structural and Investment Funds (previously EU Common 
Strategic Framework Funds) in England, strip out the 
bureaucracy of multiple programmes and align local allocations 
from the four funds with the single funding pot. 

Accept 2.28 

4 Taking full account of the Government’s national growth 
strategy, all LEPs, in collaboration with local stakeholders, 
should lead the development of a long term strategy and 
business plan for their area that will be used to bid for 
economic growth funds from central government. 

Accept 2.32 

5 The Government should allocate LEPS up to £250,000 of new 
public funding, resourced through departmental efficiency 
savings and underspends, in each of years 2013/14 and 
2014/15 specifically to devise their local economic strategies, 
and create the foundations for their implementation.

Regulation and the Compliance Code for non-economic 
regulators, the Government should impose an obligation on 
regulators to take proper account of the economic 
consequences of their actions. 

Accept 1.53 

48 In preparing for any review process, regulators should invite 
the lead sectoral trade association (or a national body in the 
case of horizontal regulators) to analyse and publish evidence 
on the impact of the regulator’s activities – both what it does 
and how it does it – on the businesses affected. This published 
evidence would then be available for analysis and comment by

process. All departmental ministers with EU business should 
consider every proactive step possible to put Britain on the 
front foot at the negotiating table.

58 The Government Property Unit should work with local 
authorities to identify and publish details of all surplus and 
derelict public land on the ePIMS database so that LEPs and 
local authorities can collaborate to bring this land back into 
reuse in support of the local economic strategy. 

Accept 1.60 


    58  


59 The Government should set up a new Development 
Corporation under an independent chairman from the private 
sector, comprised of representatives of central government, the 
Mayor of London, London boroughs, Kent and Essex councils 
and with a majority of members from the private sector and 
related disciplines. It should not exceed 20 members. Once 
created the Corporation should be given the powers it needs to 
drive its vision for future growth. It should be able to bid for its 
funds from the single pot. 

Reject 1.64 

60 The Government should accept the need to clarify urgently  
its preferred solution to the problem of airport capacity in the 
South East and indicate that preference whilst making its 
implementation conditional on the outcome of the  
next election. 

Reject 1.65 

61 The Government needs to set out a definitive and 
unambiguous energy policy, including the supporting financial 
regime, to give the sector the certainty to invest. 

Accept 1.66 

62 The Government should initiate discussions through the Bank 
of England and, in cooperation with the appropriate 
regulators, seek one or more solutions to enable UK pension 
funds to invest in UK infrastructure assets. The Government 
should ensure that best practice applies to both public and 
private sector pension fund investments. 

Accept 1.63 

63 The chambers of commerce could benefit from an enhanced 
legal status to support their role as coordinating hubs for 
business support and engagement at local level. The 
Government should consider legislating to give chambers basic 
statutory functions, whilst guaranteeing their continuing 
independence from government. It should provide for 
compensation if government opts out of these arrangements. 

Reject 1.72 

64 Government and the private sector should collaborate to create 
a strong and stable, locally-based, private sector business 
support infrastructure. This should be centred on an enhanced 
role for chambers of commerce. At the minimum, government 
should pursue option 2 and take all appropriate steps to secure 
its implementation. 

Accept in part 1.72 

65 Local authorities should publish the list of all businesses paying 
non-domestic rates so that chambers and other business 
representative bodies can identify businesses in their area more 
reliably, and seek to draw them into the local businesses 
support initiatives. There should be exceptions for businesses 
where the identification of business premises could give rise to 
security concerns. 

Accept 1.73 

66 An updated Code of Practice for Trade Associations should  
be developed. It should be given teeth by making compliance 
with the Code a condition for membership of the Trade 
Association Forum. 

Accept 1.75 

67 The Trade Association Forum should press ahead with the 
development of a competency framework for individuals to 
drive up professionalism within trade associations. 

Accept 1.75 

68 The Trade Association Forum should develop an enhanced 
directory of associations which is easily navigated through 
keyword searches. 

Accept 1.75 


     59 


69 In developing their economic plans, LEPs and chambers should 
consider ways in which leadership and management 
capabilities in local businesses can be raised making full use of 
local networks, local training providers and businesses 
themselves. Plans could, for example, incorporate 
commitments from large corporates and leading mid-size 
businesses to help raise leadership and management capacities 
in their supply chains. 

Accept 1.77 

70 The development of leadership and management skills should 
be integrated, where appropriate, into the education and skills 
system at every level, from schools through to higher education 
and vocational skills training. We need to see individuals having 
opportunities to develop their leadership and management 
capabilities earlier on in their working lives, alongside the 
development of technical or academic competencies. 

Accept 1.81 – 1.82 

71 As part of their growth commitments, departments should set 
out plans for sector-based supply chain programmes, learning 
from the experiences of the Advanced Manufacturing Supply 
Chain Initiative. 

Accept in part 1.76 

72 Government should ensure the availability of long term patient 
loan capital to growing businesses which do not want to dilute 
their equity. It should give serious consideration to tasking the 
new Business Bank to provide this either by itself or in 
partnership with the Business Growth Fund. 

Accept 1.71 

73 The Government should take a greater interest in foreign 
acquisitions from the perspective of the UK’s industrial strategy 
priorities, using an enhanced sector knowledge and expertise. 
Government should do far more to engage with potential 
foreign investors in our core sectors to secure commitments to 
developing the UK research, skills and supply base, and in 
exceptional cases to discourage unwanted investments. W e 
should underpin this by signalling a greater readiness to use 
existing powers in the Enterprise Act 2002 to allow ministers to 
consider takeovers and mergers to ensure our long term 
industrial capabilities are given proper consideration. 

Reject 1.48 

74 All failing schools should be subject to the intervention process 
forthwith. There should be a clear timetable within which an 
improvement strategy for each school is agreed, with the 
education authorities using their powers to intervene if the 
head teacher and governors fail to act. If local authorities 
delay, central government should intervene. 

Accept 1.79 

75 The regional directors being appointed to lead Ofsted’s new 
regional structure should be given formal powers to act swiftly 
where they identify problems in local schools. 

Accept in part 1.80 

76 Business engagement should be incorporated far deeper into 
the school curriculum in order to develop young people’s 
understanding of business, increase their employability, and 
further their understanding of career and future training 
options and where they might lead. LEPs should consider how 
they engage with local schools and work with chambers to 
facilitate this. 

Accept 1.87 


    60  


77 The bureaucracy and paper work around work experience and 
work placements must be streamlined. DfE must be clear about 
what is absolutely necessary. Government must then ensure 
the removal of all regulations and requirements that place 
unnecessary burdens on employers, schools and colleges. 

Accept 1.83 

78 All boards of governors in secondary schools should include 
two influential local employers, at least one of whom should 
have good connections with the wider business community. 
This could be coordinated by the local chambers of commerce. 

Accept in part 1.88 

79 Local authorities should publish the Destination Measures for 
all secondary schools in their areas alongside academic 
attainment so that parents can make better informed choices, 
and to incentivise schools to give a higher priority to 
developing the employability of their leavers. 

Accept 1.84 – 1.85 

80 The existing budget lines for adult careers advice should be 
included in the single funding pot. Each LEP, as part of its local 
economic plan, should consider how careers advice is best 
provided in its area to meet the needs of both the adult 
population and the requirement under the Education Act 2011 
for careers advice in schools. 

To be decided as 
part of the 

Spending Round 


- 

81 The budget for vocational training for learners aged 19 and 
over, and all funding currently set aside for apprenticeships for 
those aged 16 and over, should be devolved to local areas 
through the single funding pot described in Chapter 2. This 
therefore calls into question the continuation of the Skills 
Funding Agency. Each LEP should incorporate skills needs 
within their local economic plans driven by the needs of local 
employers and the practical experience of FE colleges. 

To be decided as 
part of the 

Spending Round 


- 

82 All FE learning providers must consult and agree their provision 
with LEPs to ensure that the courses they offer to 16-18 year 
olds reflect local labour requirements. In addition, any 
vocational courses delivered by FE providers to learners of any 
age must conform to the defined national standards set by 
employers and industry. 

Accept 1.89 

83 Action to address NEETs is best taken at the local level. 
Resources to tackle the problem should therefore be available 
from the single pot. Youth unemployment will not be a 
problem or priority for action in every area, but where it is, 
LEPs working with local authorities, employers and other local 
partners should develop proposals for reducing NEET numbers 
as part of their local economic plans. 

To be decided as 
part of the 

Spending Round 

1.92 

84 Industry Councils should work with the higher education sector 
to ensure that courses are relevant, incorporate placements in 
industry, and match the skills for which there is demand. 
Government needs to consider incentives to encourage and 
develop this further. 

Accept 1.90 

85 Higher Education courses should, where appropriate, be a 
collaboration between employers and universities. For shortage 
subjects for which there is strong employer demand, 
universities and employers should develop models where a 
commitment from firms of between a third and a half of a 
student’s course fees will commit the student to working for 
that employer for a fixed number of years after graduation. 
This should be taken forward by the relevant Industry Councils. 

Accept 1.91 


     61 


86 The Home Office should undertake a targeted communication 
programme to improve business understanding of the skilled 
worker immigration rules to align perception and reality. 

Accept 1,93 

87 Government should review the regulations relating to 
immigration policy as part of the Red Tape Challenge process. 

Accept in part 1.94 

88 Government should accelerate the pace at which it is tackling 
illegal immigration, overstayers and the backlog of residency 
applications. It should do this through a significant but 
temporary redeployment of public sector people and resource. 
The backlog should be tackled on a task and finish basis, with 
clear targets and milestones, so that the redeployment does 
not become permanent. 

Accept 1.95 

89 An experienced implementation team should be set up in the 
centre of government, including secondees from the private 
sector, LEPs and local authorities.
