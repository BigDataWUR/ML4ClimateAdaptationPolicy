Introduction

The Making a Difference in Dementia: Nursing 
Vision and Strategy, published in March 2013, 
set out our vision of how nurses could 
maximise their unique contribution to high-
quality, compassionate care and support for 
people with dementia and their carers/
families. In the past three years a great deal 
has been achieved, including the following: 

• There has been a continued increase in 
dementia awareness, with more than 
515,967 NHS staff at the end of March 
2015 completing Tier 1 training to better 
support people with dementia. Tier 1 
training continues to be rolled out, with a 
view to reaching all NHS staff by the end 
of 2018. The publication of the Dementia 
Core Skills Education and Training 
Framework in October 2015 will help us to 
achieve this goal, by assuring the quality 
and consistency of dementia training for 
all health and care staff.

• More than one million people have 
become Dementia Friends across 
England. The Alzheimer’s Society’s 
Dementia Friends programme is the 
biggest ever initiative aimed at changing 
people’s perceptions of  dementia, 
transforming the way we all think, act and 
talk about dementia, to help improve 
awareness and understanding. Dementia 
Friends are helping to create communities 
in which people living with dementia feel 
more understood and included. 

• The 2020 Dementia Challenge, published 
in February 2015, builds on the 
achievements of the previous 2012–15 
Challenge. It identifies what needs to be 
done by the NHS, social care, voluntary, 
community sectors and society at large, to 
make sure that dementia care, support, 
awareness and research are transformed 
by 2020. The 2020 challenge focuses on 
risk reduction, health and care, continuing 
investment in research and expansion of 
dementia-friendly communities.

• The Implementation Plan published in 
March 2016, sets out priority actions to 
ensure that the commitments set out in 
the 2020 Dementia Challenge are 
delivered.

The spirit and values set out in Making a 
Difference in Dementia: Nursing Vision and 
Strategy remain as relevant today as three 
years ago. We want to build on these, while 
appreciating that emerging challenges require 
a fresh approach. This refreshed edition of 
Making a Difference in Dementia: Nursing 
Vision and Strategy reinforces the 
fundamental role nurses play in providing 
health promotion, care and support to people 
so they can live well with dementia. It aims to 
support all nurses, irrelevant of registration or 
specialty, to be responsive to the needs of 
people with dementia, continue to develop 
their skills and expertise, and improve the 
contribution they make in achieving best 
outcomes for people with dementia, their 
carers and families, and communities.




6 Making a Difference in Dementia: Nursing Vision and Strategy Refreshed

Part one: Refreshing our vision

Dementia facts 
Dementia is not an inevitable part of ageing. 
However, as our population ages, the number 
of people living with dementia is set to 
increase. There are around 676,000 people 
with dementia in England, and this number is 
expected to double in the next 30 years. 

Dementia mainly affects older people, though 
it can start before the age of 65.

People with a learning disability are at a much 
higher risk than the general population. For 
example, people with Down’s syndrome aged 
50-59 have a one in three chance of having 
dementia.

Dementia is progressive. Initial symptoms 
include memory loss and difficulties with 
thinking, problem-solving or language. The 
most common types are Alzheimer’s disease, 
vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia 
and dementia with Lewy bodies. 

Timely diagnosis along with support and 
treatment are helping more people with 
dementia stay active and independent; and 
younger people to stay in work for longer.

Dementia affects people differently and the 
level of support required will vary. It is important 
to recognise that no two people with dementia 
or their carers are the same, and individuals 
will have unique and differing needs.

There are around 540,000 carers of people 
with dementia in England. Half of them are 
employed and it is estimated that 66,000 

people have already cut their working hours 
to make time for caring, while 50,000 people 
have left work all together.

The 2020 Dementia Challenge
The 2020 Dementia Challenge aims to 
transform dementia care, support and 
research. 

By 2020 England should be: 

• the best country in the world for dementia 
care and support and for people with 
dementia, their carers and families to 
live; and 

• the best place in the world to undertake 
research into dementia and other 
neurodegenerative diseases. 

The Government’s key aspirations include:

• improved public awareness and 
understanding of the factors which 
increase the risk of developing dementia 
and how people can reduce their risk by 
living more healthily

• in every part of the country, people with 
dementia having equal access to 
diagnosis as for other conditions

• every person diagnosed with dementia 
having meaningful care following their 
diagnosis, which supports them and those 
around them, with meaningful care being 
in accordance with published National

(NICE) quality standards. This care may 
include, for example:

– receiving information on what post-
diagnosis services are available locally 
and how these can be accessed

– access to relevant advice and support 
to help and advise on what happens 
after a diagnosis and the support 
available through the journey

– carers of people with dementia being 
made aware of and offered the 
opportunity for respite, education, 
training, emotional and psychological 
support so that they feel able to cope 
with their caring responsibilities and to 
have a life alongside caring

• all NHS staff having received training on 
dementia appropriate to their role

• all hospitals and care homes meeting 
agreed criteria to become a dementia-
friendly health and care setting

• an increase in the numbers of people of 
Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic origin 
and other seldom heard groups who 
receive a diagnosis of dementia, enabled 

through greater use by health professionals 
of diagnostic tools that are linguistically or 
culturally appropriate

• dementia research as a career opportunity 
of choice, with the UK being the best 
place for dementia research through a 
partnership between patients, 
researchers, funders and society. 

The contribution of all registered nurses to 
achieving this vision is crucial given that they 
have regular contact with patients. Nurses are 
in a unique position to provide every person 
with dementia – and their carers and families 
– with high-quality, compassionate care from 
diagnosis through to end-of-life care.

Compassionate practice 
Looking at the person with dementia, and 
dementia itself, with a fresh vision shapes the 
nurse’s role and characterises it as person-
centred, compassionate and proactive.

If dementia is seen as a long-term condition, 
it can be divided into phases, which helps 
articulate where the person might be in the 
process and how nurses can provide excellent 
nursing care and support. These phases 
overlap and are not necessarily distinct or 
always sequential, but they provide a framework 
for understanding and timely action.

Part two: The role of the nurse in dementia

The nurse’s role
Our refreshed vision defines the nurse’s 
role as: 

• interpersonal

• varied in action and intensity

• taking place in a variety of settings

• welcoming individuals, family, significant 
others and carers and respecting their 
diversity and culture

to ensure that all registered nurses are able 
to deliver safe, high-quality, compassionate 
care within all care settings, including a 
person’s own home.

The vision for the nurse’s role in dementia is 
primarily an interpersonal and social model of 
care. This is not new, but applying it in practice 
along with the medical aspects of care 
requires a person-centred approach and 
commitment. Regardless of the setting or the 
nurse’s registration or speciality, the 
interpersonal and  psycho-social model of 
care in dementia includes:

• understanding the unique experiences of 
a person living with dementia 

• building and maintaining a relationship 
with the person and their family

• respecting the person and their family and 
treating them with dignity and 
compassion, taking account of their 
culture – this is especially important when 
supporting people from ethnic minority 
communties 

• recognising the person for who they are 
and taking the time to understand their life 
story, interests, preferences, wishes, social 
networks, and strengths and abilities

• developing person-centred outcomes with 
the person and their family that recognise 
and anticipate the phases of the condition

• promoting and providing a dementia-
friendly environment

• seeking alternative sources of support, 
including signposting to non-medical 
services, if unable to provide direct 
assistance

• identifying and reporting any potential 
form of abuse that the person with 
dementia may be going through.




10 Making a Difference in Dementia: Nursing Vision and Strategy Refreshed

Nurses have an important role, regardless of 
area of registration.

For example:

• Nurses have a critical, leadership role in 
supporting and promoting dementia- 
friendly communities.

• Most people with dementia will have 
multiple long-term conditions, particularly 
older people. Nurses in primary and 
community care have a role in identifying 
health and wellbeing issues, such as 

eyesight and hearing problems, non-
attendance at critical appointments and 
ensuring adherence to medication.

• Most people with dementia will have 
another long-term condition so may be in 
contact with nurses working in other 
specialist fields such as diabetes.

• Often people with dementia are admitted 
to hospital. Nurses in hospitals have a 
responsibility to recognise, understand, 

Nurses work within an interpersonal and psycho-social model, 
understanding the effects of dementia and having the skills to 
communicate with individuals and their family/carers

Nurses have a key role in providing health education to promote 
healthy lifestyles that reduce the risks of developing dementia and 
support people to remain active and live well

All nurses undertake dementia education or training to support 
development of their knowledge, skills and expertise

Nurses on all parts of the nursing register should be aware of 
relevant safeguarding protocols and how to refer vulnerable adults, 
in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act. This will ensure that 
people with dementia have safe, effective, compassionate care

The nurse’s role includes welcoming and working in partnership 
with individuals, family and carers, respecting diversity and culture  

The nurse’s role varies in intensity and action depending on the 
phase of dementia and the person’s specific needs

Nurses have a leadership role in developing dementia-friendly 
communities and reducing stigma

respond to and support the needs of 
people with dementia and their family/ 
carers, promoting person-centred care.

• Nurses are able to offer practical advice 
and support to help people live as well as 
possible with dementia, taking account of 
their medical and non-medical needs. This 
may include liaising with different parts of 
the social care system and the voluntary 
sector, to carry out housing improvements 
and adaptations, or to help individuals to 
stay at home for longer. 

• Nurses working with people with a 
learning disability are able to support 
carers to be aware of symptoms of 
dementia, such as changes in behaviour 
and personality (e.g. becoming more 
inflexible, frustrated or withdrawn) or loss 
of daily living abilities. People with a 
learning disability who develop dementia 
generally do so at a younger age, and this 
is particularly the case for people with 
Down’s syndrome, who tend to develop 
epilepsy as a symptom.

Dementia Core Skills Education 
and Training Framework 
The Dementia Core Skills Education and 
Training Framework, published in October 
2015, was commissioned and funded by the 
Department of Health and developed by Skills 
for Health and Health Education England 
(HEE) in partnership with Skills for Care. 

The framework sets out the core skills and 
knowledge that would be transferable and 
applicable across different types of service 
provision. It includes expected learning 
outcomes for training delivery, key policy and 
legal references and is aligned to related 
national occupational standards. The aim is to 
help ensure the quality and consistency of 
dementia training, and to help prevent 
unnecessary duplication of training.

The framework is structured in three tiers and 
is applicable to the entire health and care 
workforce, including registered nurses:

• Tier 1: dementia awareness raising, in 
terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes 
for all those working in health and care 
settings

• Tier 2: knowledge, skills and attitudes for 
roles that have regular contact with people 
living with dementia

• Tier 3: enhancing the knowledge, skills 
and attitudes for key staff (experts) 
working with people living with dementia 
designed to support them to play 
leadership roles.

This will ensure that all health and care staff, 
including nurses, can gain core skills and 
knowledge that can be used across different 
clinical areas and care settings, resulting in 
increased quality of care for people living with 
dementia and their families.

Research
All registered nurses need to be aware of the 
relevant and most recent research and be 
committed to delivering evidence-based care.

Nurses who lead and deliver care can be 
trained to become researchers, able to lead 
research on issues that matter most to 
patients and carers, and to deliver results into 
clinical practice.

Nurses should consider opportunities to be 
part of the expanding dementia research 
workforce through: 

• the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Collaborations for Leadership in 
Applied Health Research and Care 
(CLAHRCs), which train nurses, social 
care and allied health professionals to 
become dementia researchers

• the Health Education England (HEE) and 
NIHR Integrated Clinical Academic (ICA) 
Programme, which provides personal 
research training awards for healthcare 
professionals, including nurses, who wish 
to develop careers that combine clinical 

research and research leadership with 
continued clinical practice and clinical 
development

• the Alzheimer’s Research UK 
PhD Scholarship

• the Alzheimer’s Society’s networks of 
Doctoral Training Centres across the UK. 

Nurses should also encourage patients and 
their families and carers to ask about 
research opportunities that could be available 
to them – reassuring them that it is “OK to 
Ask” about dementia research opportunities.

The NIHR-funded ‘Join dementia research’ 
project aims to get 25% of those diagnosed 
with dementia signed up to its database to 
make themselves potentially available for 
research into dementia.

Nurse’s role within all phases of 
dementia
The nurse’s role varies in intensity and action 
depending on the phase of dementia and the 
area of nursing practice.




Part two: The role of the nurse in dementia 13

Critical aspects of the nurse’s role at different phases within the 
dementia phase 1: When memory or other problems prompt concerns
All nurses:

• are aware and alert to the signs, symptoms and progress of dementia

• understand and take account of other conditions a person may be living with and  
where they can access appropriate support

• signpost individuals to GP for assessment, to exclude all treatable causes of 
observed symptoms

• provide leadership and support to the development of dementia-friendly environments 
and communities, including in health and social care settings

• know about local memory assessment services and how to refer individuals – and be 
able to explain to the person and their family/carers how the service can help 
individuals to live with memory changes 

• show compassion and understanding to those expressing concerns about memory, 
communication problems or other possible signs of dementia, including carers 
and family

• be aware and follow the Mental Capacity Act 2005 Code of Practice when acting 
or making decisions on behalf of someone who lacks capacity to make a decision 
for themselves.

Critical aspects of the nurse’s role at different phases within 
the dementia phase 2: Learning that the condition is dementia
All nurses:

• provide compassionate support to people who have been given a diagnosis 
of dementia

• are prepared to advocate on behalf of the person with dementia and/or their family 
and carers

• know how dementia might affect the person, their family and carers, and their health 
and care needs

• recognise the person as a unique individual and citizen with strengths as well as needs

• know how the condition might affect any co-existing condition (e.g. diabetes) and take 
this into account in their practice to manage the person’s care safely, compassionately 
and effectively.

Dementia or memory service nurses:

• work in partnership with colleagues in primary care and memory services to ensure 
that the person has a timely diagnosis delivered compassionately and taking into 
account their personal needs and circumstances.




14 Making a Difference in Dementia: Nursing Vision and Strategy Refreshed

Critical aspects of the nurse’s role at different phases within the 
dementia phase 4: Getting the right help at the right time, 
preventing crises and managing together
Nurses working in dementia services:

• work in partnership with the person, their family, carers and colleagues, to plan care, 
identify possible crisis situations and establish strategies to pre-empt or manage  
those crises

• work in partnership with colleagues and voluntary sector organisations, to identify a 
care coordinator to help the person and their family and carers navigate services

• work with the person and their family and carers to identify and articulate future 
needs, and, if wanted, support the family with lasting power of attorney and advance 
care planning

• support the person to access psychological and other relevant therapies, including 
exercise, creative therapies and meaningful activities relevant to the person’s interests

• liaise with other relevant services to ensure that they know about dementia, the 
person, plans, possible crisis points and anything else that might affect their care

• understand carer needs and concerns, welcome and support the carer as a partner 
in the care of the person with dementia

• ensure that physical health and care needs are identified and met.

Critical aspects of the nurse’s role at different phases within 
the dementia phase 3: Learning more about dementia, self-
management, options for treatment, care and support
Nurses working in dementia or memory service:

• provide information and advice about living well with a diagnosis of dementia at a time 
and in a way that the person wants

• engage with people from ethnic minority communities to ensure that people can 
access  services and support that meet their needs

• work in partnership with the person to identify needs, preferences and outcomes

• know about local services, community resources and opportunities to enable people 
to get the support they need to live well with dementia

• support the person to overcome barriers and stigma

• seek out and know about imaginative and creative treatment and care options

• ensure that the person and their family and carers know who to contact in a crisis.




Part two: The role of the nurse in dementia 15

Critical aspects of the nurse’s role at different phases within the 
dementia phase 6: Receiving care, compassion and support at the 
end of life
All nurses working with the person:

• work to understand and record a person’s wishes and preferences for end of life, 
including where they would like to die, and provide support to help achieve these 
preferences

• understand potential difficulties in communicating pain and distress, and work with 
medical colleagues and others to ensure effective pain relief

• ensure good communication between palliative care, primary care and other relevant 
colleagues and family and carers

• support the family and carers through the last days of the person’s life and signpost 
them to relevant services and bereavement support.

Critical aspects of the nurse’s role at different phases within the 
dementia phase 5: Getting help to stay at home or, if needed, 
move to alternative care accommodation
All nurses working with the person:

• work with other relevant health, social care and voluntary sector services to enable the 
person to remain at home and maintain their independence for as long as possible 

• where possible work to prevent admission to an acute hospital

• work to enable safe, timely discharge from hospital, if admitted, making sure there is 
appropriate community support 

• support the person and/or their family and carers in decision-making regarding 
alternatives to living at home

• work with care home colleagues, including providing training and supervision, to 
ensure that the person receives compassionate and safe care, participates in 
stimulating activities, and continues to live as well as possible.

Acute hospital nurses:

• support the person with dementia on the ward or A&E with knowledge, understanding 
and compassion, ensuring that their particular needs are taken into account during 
their treatment and care.
