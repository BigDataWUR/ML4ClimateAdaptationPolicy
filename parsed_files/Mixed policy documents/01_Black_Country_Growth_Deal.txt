BLACK COUNTRY GROWTH DEAL  
The Black Country Growth Deal ‘Made in the Black Country Sold Around the World’ will drive business growth, give 
people new skills, test new innovations, invest in transport infrastructure and the regeneration of key sites for housing 
and employment in the Black Country. The focus is on maximising the economic impact of growth opportunities from 
the automotive, aerospace and construction sectors, capitalising on the Black Country’s key strengths in advanced 
manufacturing. 
The Growth Deal, subject to a satisfactory conclusion of the funding agreement, will bring together local, national and 
private funding as well as new freedoms and flexibilities to focus on four key priority areas as identified in the LEP’s 
Strategic Economic Plan:  
 Raising Employability, Education and Skills 
 Improving Black Country Business Competitiveness 
 Transforming the Black Country Infrastructure and Environment 
 Improving Transport Infrastructure 

 
The Black Country LEP has secured £
7m from the Government’s Local Growth Fund to support economic 
growth in the area – with £
8m of new funding confirmed for 2015/16 and £
6m for 2016/17 to 
 This 
includes: 
 as part of the Government’s ongoing commitment to the Black Country LEP a provisional award of a further 
£
7m of funding for projects starting in 2016 and beyond; and 
 £
6m of funding which the Government has previously committed as part of Local Growth Deal funding to 
the area.   
This substantial investment from Government will bring forward at least £220m of additional investment from local 
partners and the private sector. Combined together this will create a total new investment package of £
7m 
for the Black Country LEP. 
By 2021, this Deal will create at least 4,000 jobs and allow at least 1,000 homes to be built. 

 
The Black Country LEP brings together Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council, Wolverhampton City Council, Dudley 
Metropolitan Borough Council and Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council with Higher and Further Education 
Institutions and businesses in the area. 

  
Summary of Black Country LEP Growth Deal projects and funding 
This Growth Deal brings together different funding streams designed to support local growth, and with a share of the

 The development of an Elite Centre for Manufacturing Skills  

 3  
 Improvements to access at Woods Lane, Sandwell, enabling increased housing delivery 

 
Local flexibility over Growth Deal programme: Black Country LEP has demonstrated strong partnership 
arrangements which deliver collective decisions, has articulated a clear and deliverable vision for growth in the area, 
and has established strong financial monitoring procedures and cross local authority collaboration. Government will 
disburse funds to the LEP annually in advance. The Black Country LEP will be expected to deliver the projects 
highlighted in the Deal, but will have flexibility over the management of these projects in order to deliver the greatest 
economic benefits to the area. Any significant changes to the projects will need to be discussed with the Government 
in advance. 
The Growth Deal does not amount to an endorsement of everything in the submitted SEP. All development decisions 
for specific proposals must go through the normal planning process and be guided by local plans taking into account 
all material considerations.

The Black Country Growth Deal 
The investment secured by the Deal will be focused on four key areas to deliver transformative growth: 
Raising Employability, Education and Skills 

 
The Black Country Growth Deal will agree a suite of capital investments in the skills infrastructure of the Black 
Country, providing new training opportunities for local people that align to expanding economic opportunities, 
particularly in advanced manufacturing. Projects will include a new state of the art Centre for Advanced Building 
Technologies and Construction Skills comprising 4,427m

2
 of new teaching and workshop facilities to complete a 
£48m investment in ‘Dudley Advance’. The centre will provide a lead in Building Information Modelling and up-skill 
over 3,250 people in the first five years, ensuring the local workforce is ready for the opportunities across the West 
Midlands that will result from HS
  

 
The LEP will deliver this package of investments alongside their ongoing work to encourage employers to invest in the 
skills of their workforce, increase educational attainment and the links between schools and businesses and to 
increase the skills and employability of those local people who are furthest from the labour market.  

 
Signalling the Government’s support for the Black Country’s ambition to become an employer-led centre of expertise 
in training for supply chain manufacturers is a key part of the Black Country’s Growth Deal. The Black Country 
welcomes local business interest in the proposal for the Elite Centre for Manufacturing Skills and sees this as an 
important development, with the potential to position the Black Country at the heart of national industrial development. 
Government is signalling its support for this proposal with an intention to fund £
6m in 2016/17, subject to business-
led development of the proposal.  

 
Black Country LEP commitments  Central Government commitments  
 Secure investment of £

influencing the shape of provision so that it meets the 
needs of the local economy. Moreover, they have the

 Government commits to working with the Black

Careers Service providers in the Black Country 
 Government, through the Skills Funding Agency, will 
support the process to ensure that provision meets 
local priorities and that increasing responsiveness is 
delivered through a three-pronged approach: 
o Procurement of new provision: LEPs will be 
involved throughout the process and providers’ 
track records against LEP requirements will be 
considered as part of this assessment 
o Accountability: Providers will be required through 
their funding agreements with the Agency to 
explain to LEPs details of their provision and 
planning and we are testing ways in which they 
can be most effectively held to account for being 
responsive to local economic priorities. The Skills 
Funding Agency is trialling Skills Incentives Pilots

the ability to coordinate local services towards a 
shared goal. To achieve this, Black Country LEP will 
facilitate stronger linkage between education 
providers and local businesses. We will also work 
with relevant local stakeholders to communicate our 
priorities and align our offer to the National Careers 
Service (NCS) providers ahead of the new service’s 
roll-out in October 2014 in order to augment the 
service  
 The LEP will consider skills implications as part of 
decision taking on growth strategies 
 The LEP will clearly articulate and evidence their 
skills priorities in the light of strategic national and 
local growth opportunities and communicate them to 
the Further Education and skills sector 
 The LEP will positively engage the Further Education 
and skills sector in key strategic partnerships e.g. 
Skills and Employment Boards 
 The LEP will recognise where the private sector has 
a responsibility to invest in skills provision and work 
with business and the skills system to realise that 
investment. 
from 2014/15 in Stoke and Staffordshire, the 
North East and West of England, designed to 
explore the mechanisms through which providers 
will account to LEPs for delivery 
o Allocations and Intervention: In future years 
providers’ records in delivering to LEP 
requirements will be taken into account when 
setting allocations and triggering interventions. 
From 2015/16 the Skills Funding Agency will take 
into account the outcomes of the Skills Incentive 
Pilots in Stoke and Staffordshire, the North East 
and West of England, in making allocations to 
those providers in scope; subject to evaluation of 
the pilots, these mechanisms will be rolled out to 
other LEPs in future years 
 Government will set out revised information for LEPs 
on how they can take advantage of this approach 
and options for seeking advice if provision is not 
responsive to their needs. The Skills Funding Agency 
will publish information during summer 2014 on how 
LEPs can influence the use of all skills budgets in 
their localities, and the steps they can take if they are 
dissatisfied with the pattern of delivery 
 Government will seek to improve the provision of 
skills data for LEPs and will develop and publish new 
reports that will quantify and assess responsiveness 
to local skills needs. In the summer of 2014 the Skills 
Funding Agency will provide all LEPs with a data set 
that updates them on the provision delivered in their 
areas. 

  
Improving Black Country Business Competitiveness 

 
The Black Country LEP has a very good track record of supporting business growth, which was a key project within 
the Black Country City Deal. This Growth Deal confirms additional funding to continue the delivery of the Black 
Country Growth Factory business support programme and commits Government and local partners to creating a new 
Science, Technology and Prototype Centre expanding the Wolverhampton Science Park facilities and extending 
the work of the Black Country Growth Factory and Caparo Innovation Centre. The £10m centre will provide 2,839m

 Provide public and private funding in 2015/16 to 
support the delivery of the local growth hub, at a level 
to be agreed. 
 Provide a clear model for coordinating and 
simplifying business support so that it joins up 
national, local, public and private support and creates 
a seamless customer experience for businesses, 
which makes it easy for them to get the right support 
at the right time. Black Country LEP should work 
closely with Greater Birmingham & Solihull and 
Coventry& Warwickshire LEPs on aligning 
appropriate Growth Hub activity. 
 To support extension of superfast broadband 
coverage to 90% of UK premises by 2016, via 
existing broadband projects, Black Country LEP will 
commit to work with local partners and BT to support 
delivery. To support extension of superfast 
broadband coverage to 95% of UK premises by 
2017, Black Country LEP will also work with local 
partners to help ensure match funding is in place for 
the next round of projects. 
 Provide £400k funding to the LEP for growth hub 
business support coordination, subject to the growth 
hub meeting minimum conditions that reflect the 
position agreed by the Government review on 
business support and services. 
 UKTI will commit to effectively communicating its 
strategic priorities to LEPs and where possible help 
them access relevant opportunities. UK Trade and 
Investment has doubled the number of Partnership 
Managers to sixteen. This will ensure that UK Trade 
and Investment can work more closely with LEPs and 
help build their capability to secure more inward 
investment. 
 The Technology Strategy Board recognises the 
important and valuable role that LEPs are playing in 
promoting and supporting innovation, and is 
committed to developing strong and effective 
relationships with LEPs both individually and 
collectively to build on this. The Technology Strategy 
Board is committed to supporting LEPs in developing 
the emerging Growth Hubs and in exploring how 
LEPs can help drive up local business awareness 
and engagement in Technology Strategy Board 
programmes and initiatives. 

  
Transforming the Black Country Infrastructure and Environment 

 
The Black Country LEP has identified the availability of, and access to, high quality commercial and housing sites as a 
key obstacle to local growth. The Growth Deal contains a range of projects which will bring forward large scale 
development sites for both accelerated housing development and business growth. A key commitment within the 
Growth Deal is for Government to continue to work with the Black Country LEP and local partners to secure the 
development of the Phoenix 10 site within the Black Country Enterprise Zone. This site has the potential to deliver 
substantial economic benefits for the Black Country and UK economy and is an example of the challenges facing 
development in the Black Country created by a long and varied industrial history.  

 
The Growth Deal also includes the provision of up to £15m of loan finance from the Public Works Loan Board to 
enable accelerated development of housing sites across the Black Country.

 Government will give full consideration 
to the LEP’s ambition for an economically significant 
outcome for the site, in alignment with the Strategic 
Economic Plan  
 The Government confirms that a total of up to £15m 
will be made available to the Black Country in 
2014/15 and 2015/16 at the Public Works Loan 
Board (PWLB) project rate discount of 40 basis 
points below the standard PWLB rate. This will 
support strategic infrastructure investment to enable 
increased housing development in projects such as 
the development of 600 homes in Bescot, 
Wednesbury or 200 homes at Cakemore Road, 
Blackheath which form part of the overall Growth 
Deal package  
 The Environment Agency, Natural England and 
Forestry Commission will work collaboratively with 
the Black Country LEP in accordance with the Defra 
Network offer and, if requested, will negotiate with 
the LEP to provide appropriate support, advice and 
data in bringing sites and programmes forward  
 Government will engage with the LEP to examine the 
potential to release Government land and property to 
promote local economic growth and / or housing 
development. 

  
Improving Transport Infrastructure 

 
The Black Country benefits from excellent regional and national transport links but in key areas this infrastructure has 
not kept up with the pace of growth. The Growth Deal confirms investment in a package of projects which will address 
these challenges and improve transport connections within the Black Country, enabling better access to employment 
opportunities, new homes and revitalised town centres for local people. Projects such as the Wolverhampton 
Interchange will also prepare the Black Country for the arrival of HS2 and the opportunities for national and 
international growth it will create.

Partnership Network, in the same way as with local 
and combined authorities and the Local Government 
Association. Through its Route Strategies, the 
Highways Agency will engage the LEP in better 
understanding the challenges and opportunities 
associated with the network and to develop evidence 
based long-term plans to bring about much needed 
local economic growth and development, and 
commits to providing each LEP with a named

Agency company includes a requirement to co-
operate, which will underpin the arrangements 
described above 
 The Department for Transport and Network Rail 
commit to more proactive engagement of the LEP in 
the long-term rail planning process (e.g. Route 
Studies) and in rail franchise specification through 
targeted local engagement of the LEP as part of an 
enhanced consultation process. The Department for 
Transport also commits to encourage bidders for 
franchises to identify and take into account the 
priorities of LEPs and other key local stakeholders as 
part of the franchising process, and will also 
encourage Train Operating Companies to continue 
with, and enhance where possible, their engagement 
with LEPs as key local stakeholders. 

  
As part of the deal, the LEP will: 
 Strengthen governance: The Black Country has established a Joint Committee as the latest step in their 
long track record of successful partnership working. Government would welcome further progress in 
implementing the planned sharing of resources and intelligence at an operational level through ‘Team Black 
Country’.  
 Ensure implementation and demonstrate success by tracking progress against milestones and agreed 
core metrics and outcomes in line with a monitoring and evaluation framework. This will include agreeing 

9  
monitoring metrics and reporting arrangements with the Government by September 
 The LEP will also 
produce an evaluation plan for the projects contained in the Deal before April 
 
 Ensure value for money by developing robust processes that will guide local decision-making. This will 
include agreeing an assurance framework with the Government by September 2014, building on existing local 
and national frameworks. 
 Communicate the ongoing outputs and outcomes of the Deal to the local community and stakeholders 
by publishing the Growth Deal and reporting regularly, and publically, on their progress to implement the 
strategy, ensuring that local people understand how Government money is being spent via the Growth Deal, 
and what the benefits are for them and the area.  The Cities and Local Growth Unit will continue to work with 
the LEPs on communications activities, and help make the links with other Government communications 
teams. 
Funding for projects starting in 2016/17 will be subject to conditions that Government will discuss with the LEP over 
the next few weeks and months, along with establishing the best timetable for the project, taking into account 
practicalities and affordability. 
The Government commits to opening discussions with the LEP right away on its priorities for the next round of Growth 
Deals.
