EXPLANATORY NOTE - AMENDMENTS 

CLAUSE 213, SCHEDULE 42: TRUSTS WITH VULNERABLE 
BENEFICIARY 

SUMMARY 

1. The amendments make detailed changes to ensure that: 

• the definition of ‘disabled person’ for the purposes of a trust with a 
vulnerable beneficiary includes all those who claim constant 
attendance allowance, including by way of an increase in disablement 
pension; 

• a person remains a ‘disabled person’ if he or she would be entitled to 
receive a qualifying welfare benefit were it not for them being in a 
publicly funded institution (such as a hospital) or abroad; 

• harmonisation of how the trust income and capital can be used is 
complete by applying also to ‘interest in possession’ trusts in the 
Inheritance Tax code; and 

• ‘grand-fathered’ rights under the commencement rules are preserved 
where a codicil to a will, or a new will, continues provision that a 
qualifying vulnerable beneficiary trust be established. 

DETAILS OF THE AMENDMENTS 

2. Amendments 110 to 114 amend paragraph 7(4) of Schedule 42 to the 
Finance Bill so as to include within section 89A of the Inheritance 
Tax Act (IHTA) 1984


3. 


 the assumption that the beneficiary is entitled 
to receive constant attendance allowance or armed forces 
independence payment when resident outside the UK or in a care 
home, hospital or prison. 

Amendment 115 inserts paragraph 7(7) to Schedule 42 so as to amend 
the heading to section 89A of IHTA 1984


4. 


 in recognition that a person 
may be disabled at the time of self-settlement, but not a ‘disabled 
person’ as defined. 

Amendment 116 inserts paragraph 9A to Schedule 42


5. . 

Paragraph 9A(1) amends section 89B(1)(c) of IHTA 1984 to provide

property that is applied is to be applied for the benefit of the disabled 
person. 


 

FINANCE BILL 

CLAUSE 213 
SCHEDULE 42 


   

6. Paragraph 9A(2) adds new section 89C to IHTA 1984


7. 


, which 
provides that, for the purposes of section 89B(1)(c) or (d), any of the 
settled property that is applied is to be applied for the benefit of the 
disabled person; and that powers that enable trustees to apply in a tax 
year up to an ‘annual limit’ of the lower of £3,000 or 3% of the 
maximum value of the settled property in that period for the benefit of 
persons other than the disabled person do not disqualify a trust from 
being a qualifying trust for the benefit of a disabled person.  The 
amounts and circumstances may be amended by Treasury order. 

Paragraphs 9A(3) and (4)


8. 


 provide that new section 89C commences 
from Royal assent and for transition. 

Amendments 117 to 123 amend the consolidated meaning of 
‘disabled person’ at Schedule 1A to Finance Act 2005 (as inserted by 
paragraph 18 of Schedule 42 to the Bill


9. ). 


Amendment 117



10. 


 adds a person in receipt of an increased disablement 
pension to paragraph 1 of Schedule 1A. 

Amendments 118 to 120 simplify the structure of paragraphs 2 to 7 of 
Schedule 1A



11. 


 to ensure, for the purposes of attendance allowance, 
disability living allowance and personal independence payment, that a 
person is treated as a disabled person if he or she would be entitled to 
receive a relevant payment or allowance were it not for them being 
resident outside the UK or in a care home, hospital or prison. 

Amendment 121 inserts paragraphs 7A to 7C of Schedule 1A



12. 


 to treat, 
for the purposes of increased disablement pension, constant 
attendance allowance and armed forces independence payment, a 
person as a disabled person if he or she would be entitled to receive a 
relevant payment or allowance were it not for them being resident 
outside the UK or in a care home, hospital or prison. 

Amendment 122 extends the definition of “constant attendance 
allowance” at paragraph 8 of Schedule 1A



13. .  


Amendment 123 inserts at paragraph 8 of Schedule 1A



14. 


 a definition 
for “increased disablement pension”. 

Amendment 124 amends the meaning of “relevant settlement” at 
paragraph 19 of Schedule 42 so that the transitional provisions at 
paragraphs 9(2), 11(7) and 12(7) apply where the settlement arises 
under a codicil to a will, or a new will, made on or after 8 April that 
contains provisions in the same terms (in relation to the settlement) as 
a will or codicil made prior to that date by the testator.

CLAUSE 213 
SCHEDULE 42 


   

BACKGROUND 

15. Special tax rules exist for trusts with a vulnerable beneficiary.  The 
rules: 

• reduce, following an election and annual claim, the trustees’ tax 
liability on income and chargeable gains to an amount that, 
broadly, would be chargeable on the beneficiary if the gains had 
accrued and/or the income had arisen directly to that person; 

• extend the annual exempt amount of chargeable gains that 
applies to trusts to match that available to individuals; 

• ignore the normal charges to inheritance tax for trusts; instead, 
the property is treated as part of the beneficiary’s estate on their 
death. 

16. Clause 213 and Schedule 42 harmonise rules that limit how the 
income and capital of a trust with a vulnerable beneficiary may be 
applied and extend the meaning of a ‘disabled person’ to include 
those in receipt of the daily living component of personal 
independence payment, armed forces independence payment or 
constant attendance allowance. 

17. Trusts created by a will executed prior to the commencement date (8 
April 2013) may apply the pre-existing rules as to how the trust 
income and capital can be applied.  However concern was raised that 
these ‘grand-fathered’ rights would be lost where a will is amended 
to, for example, change an executor or add a new legacy.
