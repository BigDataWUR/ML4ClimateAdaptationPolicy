UK Renewable Energy Roadmap

Ministerial Foreword 
The nations of the United Kingdom are endowed with vast and varied renewable 
energy resources. We have the best wind, wave and tidal resources in Europe.  

The UK leads the world in offshore wind, with more than 700 turbines already 
installed, and is accelerating the deployment of onshore wind with the biggest 
projects in Europe already operating and under construction in Scotland and Wales. 
Taken together onshore and offshore wind provide enough power for more than two 
and a half million homes. But we could do so much more. Our challenge is to bring 
costs down and deployment up.  

This document – the UK’s first Renewable Energy Roadmap – sets out our shared 
approach to unlocking our renewable energy potential.   

This UK Roadmap builds on the actions already underway: financial support 
mechanisms for renewables, the Green Investment Bank to help companies secure 
investment in green infrastructure, and encouraging the development of new 
offshore wind manufacturing facilities at port sites.  

The Government’s Electricity Market Reform White Paper, published alongside this 
Roadmap, sets out our reforms to the separate Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
markets for all forms of electricity generation. Reform will ensure that low-carbon 
electricity from a diverse range of sources - not just renewables - becomes a more 
attractive choice for investors, delivering long-term change while minimising cost to 
the consumer.   

Renewable energy isn’t just about electricity. This year, we worked together to create 
the world’s first incentive to support the widespread deployment of renewable heat. 
This new financial mechanism will encourage installation of equipment like heat 
pumps and biomass boilers  – reducing emissions and supporting 150,000 jobs in 
the UK’s heating industry.  

Likewise, the Renewables Transport Fuels Obligation and support of over 
£400million to increase uptake of ultra-low carbon vehicles will help to reduce the 
carbon impact of transport. The UK Government will also be publishing a Bioenergy 
Strategy by the end of this year to give a clear signal on the most cost-effective and 
sustainable role for bioenergy in heat, transport and electricity, which between them 
could contribute around half of the overall 2020 target. 

We also recognise the need to reduce demand. Energy efficiency is the most cost 
effective way of closing the gap between supply and demand, which is why we have 
launched the Green Deal and the roll out of smart meters in Great Britain. Much is 
already being done across the UK yet there are other opportunities to tap into energy 
efficiency potential, which will be a key area of work for the new Office of National 
Energy Efficiency working alongside the Office for Renewable Energy Deployment in 
partnership with the Devolved Administrations.

Renewable energy already employs more than a quarter of a million people; by 
2020, it could be over half a million. The creation of jobs in the renewable energy 
sector, investment in new manufacturing capability, and the consequent direct and 
indirect benefits will support our transition to a green economy. 

Getting more renewable energy across the UK  can give us much more security and 
a greater degree of energy independence – helping to shield us from global fossil 
fuel price fluctuation.  

Timely investments will ensure renewable energy will have a long-term role to play 
as part of a mix of low carbon generation. Alongside energy efficiency, nuclear, and 
carbon capture and storage, renewable energy will help reduce UK emissions in line 
with our carbon budgets and help keep us on track to hit our 2050 target – an 80% 
cut in emissions.  

To consider how we might get there, the UK Committee on Climate Change have 
published renewable energy scenarios to 2030. The UK Government will respond to 
this advice by the end of the year; this response, alongside the Annual Energy 
Statement and policies to meet the 4th Carbon Budget, will place renewables firmly 
within the energy mix.  

The time for broad strategy statements has passed. The UK Renewable Energy 
Roadmap sets out a comprehensive suite of targeted, practical actions to accelerate 
renewable energy in the UK – driving innovation and the deployment of a wide range 
of renewables. It will help the UK Government meet our EU 2020 target, and should 
ensure that the cost of renewable energy falls over time.  It complements and 
strengthens parallel activity by the Devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and 
Northern Ireland, each of which has set its targets and ambitions, which taken 
together make a major contribution to renewable deployment. 

By working together we can build a cleaner, greener energy future. This UK 
Renewable Energy Roadmap helps to show us the way.

UK Renewable Energy Roadmap

Executive Summary 
The Coalition Government has made clear its commitment to increasing the 
deployment of renewable energy across the UK in the sectors of electricity, heat 
and transport. This will make the UK more energy secure, will help protect 
consumers from fossil fuel price fluctuations, is driving investment in new jobs 
and businesses in the renewable energy sector, as well as keep us on track to 
meet our carbon reduction objectives for the coming decades. Renewables will 
be a key part of the decarbonisation of the energy sector necessary by 2030, 
alongside nuclear, carbon capture and storage, and improvements in energy 
efficiency.   
Over the last year the Office for Renewable Energy Deployment in DECC, has 
been working with market participants and others from across the renewables 
sector to better understand how much renewable energy can be deployed 
through to 2020, and to identify the current constraints which must be 
addressed to allow this rapid transformation. 

The result, from multiple sources, forms the heart of this plan – a delivery 
Roadmap to set us on the path to achieve the UK’s renewable energy target 
over the next decade. 

Our evidence shows that: 

• Even though we are starting from a low level, the UK can meet the target to 
deliver 15% of the UK’s energy consumption from renewable sources by 
2020. Recent ‘bottom-up’ analysis, tested with industry, suggests that there 
is significant upside potential as well as downside risk to deployment; 

• Based on current information, and taking account of their long term potential 
as well as their cost effectiveness, 8 technologies are capable of delivering 
more than 90% of the renewable energy we need for 2020; 

• Renewable electricity has become well established. The existing pipeline1 of 
large-scale projects is strong, and allowing for historic dropout rates, has the 
potential to put us on track to deliver a total of 29 GW of operational capacity 
by 2020; 

• The pipeline for renewable heat projects is less well developed, but following 
the introduction of the world’s first incentive for renewable heat, could deliver 
as many as 124,000 renewable heat installations by 2020;  

• Road transport biofuels already make up over 3% by volume of all road 
transport fuels and are proposed to increase to 5% by 2014. Subject to the 
results of current consultations, Government will come forward with options

in Spring 2012 for the period after 2014; 

• The costs of renewable energy technologies are uncertain but are expected 
to fall over time as supply chains develop, technical challenges are 
overcome, and the cost of capital reduces with lower risk; 

• There are cross cutting barriers to deployment for all or many of the 
renewable energy technologies as well as barriers that apply to specific 
technologies, all of which need to be addressed to achieve our aims for 
deployment and cost reduction.  

This Roadmap shows where we are now; analysis of how deployment may 
evolve by 2020, together with separate estimates of the market’s view of the 
potential; and the actions required to set us on the path to achieve the 
deployment levels anticipated in our analysis. 

While renewable deployment across all technologies will be important, the 
Roadmap focuses in particular on the 8 technologies that have either the 
greatest potential to help the UK meet the 2020 target in a cost effective and 
sustainable way, or offer great potential for the decades that follow. The key 
actions in this Roadmap for each of the 8 technologies are: 

• Onshore wind: Provide long term certainty for investors through electricity 
market reform and a managed transition from the Renewables Obligation. 
Reform the planning system to ensure it supports economic growth and 
gives communities a greater stake in development. Co-fund the 
development of technical solutions to overcome windfarm interference with 
aviation radar and broker roll-out plans, including through a new 
Memorandum of Understanding with industry. Upgrade onshore 
transmission capacity and ensure that developers secure timely and cost-
effective access to the network and put in place a process to monitor 
delivery; 

• Offshore wind: Establish an industry Task Force to set out a path and 
action plan to reduce the costs of offshore wind to £100/MWh by 2020. 
Provide up to £30m of direct Government support for offshore wind cost 
reduction over the next 4 years. Work through the Offshore Wind 
Developers Forum to support the development of the supply chain alongside 
action to encourage new manufacturing facilities at port sites. Manage 
conflicts with oil and gas exploration, provide greater certainty over financial 
incentives, and ensure timely and coordinated development of the grid 
through the Offshore Transmission Coordination Project; 

• Marine energy: Provide up to £20m over the next 4 years to support 
innovation in wave and tidal devices and commission marine energy testing 
facilities at the National Renewable Energy Centre (NaREC) early in 2012. 
Work with The Crown Estate to introduce a knowledge sharing network to 
accelerate the level of marine energy deployment. Provide guidance to the 
sector by March 2012 to help develop Marine Energy Parks in order to 
stimulate the supply chain. Manage potential conflicts with other users of the

sea by working with marine regulators and publishing later this year the 
response to the wave and tidal elements of the Offshore Energy Strategic 
Environmental Assessment; 

• Biomass electricity: Publish a UK Bioenergy Strategy later this year 
articulating a clear vision for the growth of sustainable biomass energy in the 
UK. Apply the Strategy in deciding, a year ahead of the original timetable, 
new Renewables Obligation bands to come into force from April 2013, and 
link payments to sustainability standards from April 2013. Focus on 
measures to support long-term waste fuel supplies including through 
possible landfill restrictions on waste wood. Work with regulators to 
introduce cost effective fuel monitoring and sampling systems and ensure 
that environmental legislation does not have an unintended impact on 
renewable energy plant; 

• Biomass heat: Increase the attractiveness of biomass heat and biomethane 
injection into the grid through introduction of the Renewable Heat Incentive 
(RHI) and the Renewable Heat Premium Payment (RHPP) in Great Britain. 
Consult this summer on a new scheme to support renewable heat in 
Northern Ireland subject to agreement of the Northern Ireland Executive. 
Ensure sustainability of biomass heat through the introduction of reporting 
criteria for feedstock from 2011 and emission performance standards under 
phase 2 of the RHI. Work with regulators to enable Anaerobic Digestion 
plant to benefit from reduced regulatory burdens and faster permitting, 
including whether it is appropriate to amend regulations which apply to 
biogas injection to the grid;  

• Ground source and air source heat pumps: Introduce the RHI for non-
domestic installations and the RHPP for eligible domestic scale heat pumps. 
Streamline the planning and consenting processes through the provision of 
guidance for open-loop ground source heat pumps and permitted 
development rights for some air source heat pumps on domestic properties. 
Collect data on how best to improve heat pump performance and raise the 
technical abilities of installers by tightening standards of training under the 
Microgeneration Certification Scheme; 

• Renewable transport: Identify and agree a preferred approach to achieve 
the 2020 transport sub-target, and actions for implementation after 2014.  
Consider the European Commission’s proposals on Indirect Land-Use 
Change impacts of biofuels with a view to ensuring effective standards. 
Support the market for plug-in vehicles by making up to £30m available for 
investment in recharging infrastructure and providing a grant of up to 25% of 
the purchase price (capped at £5000) for eligible electric, plug-in hybrid or 
hydrogen fuel cell cars.  

Taking these actions will not only help drive deployment across the UK but will 
also be key to reducing the costs of renewables, enabling technologies to 
mature so that over the medium to long-term they no longer need additional 
support to compete on a level playing field against other low carbon

technologies.   

Of course, technology costs, innovation breakthroughs and barriers to 
deployment will change over time. Government will closely monitor deployment 
and the development of the market. We will update the Roadmap on an annual 
basis so that we know how we are doing and whether other technologies can 
make a bigger or cheaper contribution than is assumed here. 

We want the UK to be the location of choice for inward investment and a world 
class centre of energy expertise.  The actions set out in this Roadmap will 
enable us to successfully exploit our renewable resources, make a strong 
contribution to our energy needs, provide opportunities for jobs and wealth 
creation, and contribute to efforts to reduce emissions of harmful greenhouse 
gases. 


  

UK Renewable Energy Roadmap

Chapter 1 - Introduction 
Government commitment to renewables 

1.1 The Coalition has made clear its commitment to increase the amount of 
renewable energy deployed in the UK. This will make the UK more energy 
secure, will help protect consumers from fossil fuel price fluctuations, will help 
drive investment in new jobs and businesses in the renewable energy sector, 
as well as keep us on track to meet our carbon reduction objectives for the 
coming decades.  


 

1.2 Our goal is to ensure that 15% of our energy demand is met from renewable 

sources by 2020 in the most cost effective way. Ambition is equally strong 
across all areas of the UK, where the Devolved Administrations have set 
themselves challenging domestic targets for both the level of renewable 
electricity and heat consumption by 2020.  


  

1.3 Our ambition extends beyond 2020. Recent independent advice2 from the 

Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has made clear the long term role for 
renewable energy. The CCC concluded that there is scope for the  penetration 
of renewable energy to reach 30 - 45% of all energy consumed in the UK by 
2030. CCC also recognised that achieving this level of growth would require 
resolution of current uncertainties and cost reductions. This Roadmap sets out 
how we will tackle the non-financial barriers to renewables deployment, 
enabling the market to grow in line with our goals for 2020 and beyond.            

                                            
2 UK Government commissioned independent advice on the level of ambition for renewable energy to 2020 
and 2030 from the Committee of Climate Change (CCC). The UK Government will respond to the CCC 
recommendations alongside the 4th Carbon Budget later this year.    

Ambitions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland 

All across the UK, action is being taken to use our significant resources to deploy 
renewables still further and faster, ensuring security and sustainability of energy supply. 
In addition to the overarching UK renewables target, the Devolved Administrations have 
set ambitious but achievable targets at a domestic level: 


 

• The Scottish Government has introduced a target to deliver 100% renewable 

electricity by 2020;  

• The Northern Ireland Executive has a target to deliver 40% renewable electricity 
and 10% renewable heat by 2020; 

• The Welsh Government has indicated that it has the potential to produce twice the 
amount of electricity it currently uses from renewable sources by 2025, and deliver 
4 GW of this from marine energy.

Ensuring value for money  

1.4 Securing renewable sources of energy is a key pillar of the UK Government’s 
strategy for a diverse, low carbon energy system alongside nuclear, cleaner 
coal and gas, and energy efficiency. However, as a relatively new, emerging 
set of technologies, renewables tend to be more expensive than existing fossil 
fuel generation.  


 

1.5 Doing nothing is not necessarily the least cost option given the potential price 

rises of fossil fuels in the future and the potential impacts on security of supply. 
However, there is a clear need to deliver our goals in a way that is consistent 
with sustainable economic growth and minimising the impacts of energy and 
climate change policies on consumer bills. We are already taking steps to 
maximise cost effectiveness and value for money through: 


 

• Undertaking regular review of technology costs: Renewable technology 

costs are expected to fall with time. It is our responsibility to ensure that 
developers have an adequate incentive to drive early deployment but that 
they are not overcompensated at the expense of the consumer; 


 

• Tackling non-financial barriers and supporting the supply chain: Take 

action to help drive down technology costs, and support inward investment in 
the supply chain to increase competition and move manufacturing closer to 
the point of installation;  


 

• Working within public spending and affordability limits: Manage our 

policies to stay within cost limits and achieve our goals in a way that is 
consistent with sustainable economic growth and minimising the impact on 
consumer bills; 


 

• Reforming the electricity market: The package of Electricity Market 

Reform (EMR) measures has been designed to be the most cost effective 
means to meet our energy and climate change objectives. This means that, 
while electricity bills are expected to increase in the years ahead due in part 
to rising wholesale electricity and carbon prices, our reforms are likely to limit 
this increase for domestic, non-domestic and energy intensive consumers;   


 

• Promoting energy efficiency: Our target is a percentage of overall energy 

consumption, if we can reduce our consumption we reduce our need for 
deployment. Reduced energy consumption will also reduce bill impacts.  


 

1.6 Alongside these steps to reduce the costs of domestic action, we have the 

potential to work with our European partners on renewables deployment. This 
could provide an important mechanism to safeguard UK consumers in the 
event that the costs of domestic deployment do not come down sufficiently, and 
alternative, cheaper opportunities arise in other countries where the UK could 
“trade” through the use of the flexibility mechanisms in the Renewable Energy 
Directive.   


 


UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


11 


1.7 This should not be viewed as a one-way exercise – trading presents an 
opportunity for the UK. We have an abundant offshore wind resource and could 
also export energy generated in UK waters to neighbouring Member States. As 
part of this we could see offshore wind projects connected across the British 
Isles and to mainland Europe, increasing our security of supply as part of an 
“All Islands Approach”, and providing new manufacturing and jobs in the 
renewable energy sector in the UK. We will look to ensure that we have powers 
to enable both export and import of renewable energy under the flexibility 
mechanisms in the Renewable Energy Directive where this can secure the 
greatest benefit to the UK.   


  


The Renewable Energy Roadmap 


 

1.8 Over the last year the Office of Renewable Energy Deployment has been 

working with industry, financiers, the Devolved Administrations and others to 
understand recent trends in renewables deployment in the UK, and the pipeline 
of projects that could come forward before 2020, as well as the barriers that 
need to be overcome to enable these projects to be delivered successfully and 
cost effectively. This document sets out that analysis together with a targeted 
programme of action that Government is taking to increase renewables 
deployment.   


 

1.9 This Roadmap is the first of a kind.  Whilst it sets out a comprehensive 

programme of action, it also recognises that the barriers to deployment, 

Box 1:  All Islands Approach  

Ministers from the British Isles, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man recently signed up 
to co-operate on exploiting the major wind and marine resources in and around the islands. 
The nations  involved agreed to co-operate in an All Islands Approach to energy in the June 
2011 British Irish Council held in London. 

The All Islands Approach to energy resources across the British Islands and Ireland will 
encourage and enable developers to exploit commercial opportunities for generation and 
transmission, facilitate the cost-effective exploitation of the renewable energy resources 
available, and increase integration of our markets and improves security of supply.  

Optimising the natural resource available around our islands would benefit us all. It makes 
sense to develop and share clean, green secure energy with our neighbours rather than 
import vast amounts of fossil fuels from far flung parts of the world. In practice, more 
interconnection between the islands would mean that on, for instance, a very windy day in 
mainland Britain, surplus power could be sold to Ireland and mainland Europe, as well as 
enabling imports of electricity from Ireland and mainland Europe, when required. 

The approach will encourage and enable developers to exploit commercial opportunities for 
generation and transmission, facilitate the cost-effective exploitation of the renewable 
energy resources available, and increase integration of members markets and improve 
their security of supply.

technology costs, and innovation breakthroughs will change with time. The 
Roadmap establishes a process of monitoring and evaluation that will enable 
us to adjust our approach. We propose to publish updates on an annual basis.  


 


UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


13 


Chapter 2:  Analysis  
2.1 We have gathered evidence on the potential deployment and costs of 

renewable energy technologies to 2020. This has allowed us to understand 
how, and with which mix of technologies, the market can deliver 15% of our 
energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  


 

2.2 We have also examined the most recent data on current deployment levels and 

projects which are in the pipeline for possible deployment in the future. By 
comparing the potential level of deployment in 2020 against baseline data we 
have estimated growth rates for each technology and, where possible, how 
much of the increase could be met from projects already in the pipeline.  


 

2.3 Analysis of the pipeline has also allowed us to map the stages of deployment 
for key technologies, identify the challenges they face, and develop a targeted 
programme of actions.  


 

Deployment of renewable energy to 2020 

2.4 Our analysis of potential deployment to 2020 considers factors such as 
technology cost, build rates, and the policy framework. These variables have 
been modelled to produce illustrative ‘central ranges’ for deployment.   


 

2.5 The central ranges do not represent technology specific targets or the level of 
our ambition. They are based on our current understanding of deployment, 
costs and non-financial barriers and could change significantly as the market 
evolves to 20203. Indeed in some cases – such as for offshore wind – we are 
targeting specific actions to reduce cost and increase likely deployment. In 
others, forthcoming work – including on the RO Banding Review consultation 
and decisions on biofuels – could have an impact. We will update our analysis 
annually to reflect the evolution of policy and observed levels of deployment.  


 

2.6 Figure 1 aggregates the central view of deployment across technologies. It 

illustrates that, despite uncertainty about the contribution from individual 
technologies (discussed in Chapter 3), the UK can deliver 234 TWh of 
renewable energy overall in 2020 – equivalent to 15% of our projected energy 
consumption4. Whilst the contribution from individual technologies could vary, 
underachievement on one will allow the UK to deliver more of another within its 
financial support framework5. 


  


                                            
3 Figures for the heat sector reflect uncertainty in potential growth rates and the rates of return needed to 
incentivise take-up. In the electricity sector the range reflects preliminary analysis of the uncertainty of the 
impact on deployment of changes to fossil fuel prices, future cost reductions, the success of overcoming non-
financial barriers to deployment.  
4 Energy demand is forecast to be 1557 TWh in 2020 in the Government’s central projection on the RED 
definition. 
5 In the case of renewable transport, targets for biofuels have not yet been set beyond 2014.

Figure 1: Central view of deployment and the 15% target 


 

2.7 The analysis also indicates that approximately 90% of the generation 
necessary to meet the 15% target can be delivered from a subset of 8 
technologies (set out in Figure 2 below). These technologies are particularly 
significant due to their cost effectiveness, potential level of deployment, and 
importance to the UK’s 2050 energy mix.

2.8 This Roadmap, and our action to tackle non-financial barriers to deployment, is 
focused on these 8 technologies. The remaining renewable energy generation 
necessary to meet the 2020 target will come from technologies such as 
hydropower, solar PV, and deep geothermal heat and power. These will 
generally qualify for renewable financial incentives and will benefit from action 
to unblock cross-cutting non-financial barriers, including those set out in the 
recent Microgeneration Strategy for England. Microgeneration technologies will 
also benefit from the Government’s commitment to Zero Carbon Homes.

Case study: Solar PV 

Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has shown significant development in recent years, 
with ongoing technological improvements and capital costs falling. By the end of May 
2011 nearly 38,000 solar PV installations in Great Britain were receiving support through 
the Feed-in Tariff (see below).  

The appetite for solar PV technology is global, 
led by a number of major international markets, 
and this wide uptake is playing a major part in 
driving down costs. Modules and inverters 
account for over half of the final cost of an 
installation, and we understand that this is where 
there is greatest scope for further cost 
reductions. As a relatively small player in the 
international solar PV market, the UK is 
necessarily a “price taker” – we benefit from the 
global cost reductions.  

The Government believes that solar PV could potentially have a role to play in larger-
scale UK renewables deployment in the future, though this will depend on a number of 
factors. One of these is that sufficient cost reductions will need to be achieved so that the 
viability of projects is not dependent on significant subsidy. Work for industry6 suggests 
that this point may be reached during this decade.  

To demonstrate our commitment to solar PV as a large scale generation source in the UK, 
the Government currently provides financial support for the technology through the 
Renewables Obligation. The rate is set so that solar PV can be supported and contribute 
to large-scale renewables generation and to encourage cost reduction to improve its 
competitiveness against more established technologies. The Renewables Obligation is 
subject to a Banding Review this year, with new rates to take effect from April 2013. 

In addition, at present the Feed-in Tariffs scheme supports small-scale solar PV 
generation such as the solar tiles on the roof of the house illustrated above. The scheme 
is currently being reviewed; new rates for PV installations over 50 kW will take effect from 
1 August 2011, and any further rate changes that arise from the review for installations at 
all scales will take effect from April 2012 (unless the review reveals the need for greater 
urgency). 


 

Uncertainties in delivering our 2020 ambition 


 

2.9 In developing a programme of action for renewables it is also important to take 

account of wider uncertainty. Key uncertainties include future energy demand, 
the cost of technologies, and the level of renewable energy deployment which 
industry believes can be achieved.

2.10 To illustrate the uncertainty around deployment potential we have gathered 

initial views from the market7 about the range of growth levels they considered 
feasible for individual technologies. The analysis, set out in Box 2, shows that 
there is significant upside potential to deployment if markets develop more 
quickly than expected (the ‘industry high’ scenario) but also downside risk if we 
are less successful in removing barriers (‘industry low’)8.  


 

2.11 In Chapter 3 we overlay industry high and low scenarios for each technology 
around the central ranges discussed above. For most technologies the central 
range lies inside the industry scenarios, although for marine this is not the case 
– a difference which reflects the greater levels of uncertainty for early-stage 
technologies.  


 

2.12 Recent work for DECC suggests that, although renewable electricity9 and 

heat10 technologies are generally more expensive than fossil fuel generation,

8 Scenarios presented in Box 2, and by technology in Chapter 3, do not include contribution we expect from 
domestic heat (for which policies are being finalised) and use different load factors from central range. 
9 Costs are expressed in 2010 prices. Costs for renewable electricity are based on capital and operating costs, 
including fuel costs, provided by Arup and Ernst & Young to inform the 2011 Banding Review. Costs for CCGT 
are based on work by PB Power. Cost ranges are based on varying capital costs. Costs for 2020 for offshore 
wind reflect both Round 2 project and Round 3 projects / projects in Scottish Territorial Water projects, 

Box 2: Industry deployment scenarios  


 

DECC’s work on deployment uncertainty to 2020 relies on analysis by AEA 
Technology, who used published literature and discussions with industry to arrive 
at an initial view of the market’s ability to deploy renewables across the decade. 
The analysis was stakeholder-focused and was ‘bottom up’ (based on 
considering the market’s appetite for individual technologies and projects) rather 
than the ‘top-down’ model-based approach. The results, presented in Figure 3, 
were subsequently tested with a wide range of companies.

costs are uncertain and are likely to come down over the longer term. The 
results of our analysis are set out in Figures 4-7 below for projects achieving 
financial close in 2010 or 2020.

whereas the figures for 2010 reflects only Round 2. There is no data for marine in 2010 as the marine 
technologies which are of interest for 2020 have not yet been fully commercially deployed. 
10 Cost ranges for heat are based on capital, borrowing, operating, fuel and barrier costs provided by AEA 
Technology to support development of the Renewable Heat Incentive. They refer to non-domestic sector 
installations. Due to a lack of reliable data we assume that costs for biogas are fixed over time.

2.13 The range of cost uncertainty is particularly large for technologies such as 

marine, which is at the early stages of commercial deployment in the UK, and 
biomass heat technologies, for which supply chains have not yet been tested at 
scale. Cost reductions are expected to be most pronounced for electricity 
technologies, particularly offshore wind and solar PV, as supply chains and 
technologies develop to 2020. The cost of generating heat and electricity from 
fossil fuels is also expected to rise over time.  


 

2.14 It is essential that costs of renewable technologies fall over the decade as 

deployment increases. Our goal in the medium to long term is to help 
renewables compete on a level playing field against other low carbon 
technologies. We will regularly review our subsidy programmes to take account 
of cost changes from supply chain development, learning, and technical 
breakthrough.  


 

2.15 Uncertainty about projected energy demand is also a consideration. DECC 

analysis suggests that uncertainty around factors such as GDP growth, prices, 
consumer behaviour and the impact of energy efficiency policy mean that total 
energy demand could vary from our central projection. Our estimates suggest a 
margin of uncertainty of at least +/-  8% from our 2020 central estimate of 1,557 
TWh. An increase of 8% would add around 19 TWh to our deployment goal of 
234 TWh for 2020. DECC’s Office of National Energy Efficiency is putting in 
place a range of policies to drive energy efficiency in the UK. 


 

2.16 In Chapter 4 we set out our approach to handling uncertainty in more detail. 

Our key commitment is to work with industry to refresh the analysis and actions

set out in the Roadmap as new information emerges about deployment, costs, 
energy demand, and policy impact. We believe that the 15% target is 
achievable through cost-effective domestic action, but acknowledge the 
uncertainty and are putting in place a framework to allow contingency action, 
including taking powers to enable trading, should it be required.  

Progress in renewable deployment  

2.17 As illustrated in Figure 8, renewable energy accounted for 54 TWh (3.3%)11 of 
the UK’s total energy consumption in 2010, having increased steadily since 
2005, and by 15% between 2008 and 2009. We will need to see more than a 
four-fold increase in our renewable energy consumption by 2020 if 15% of our 
energy needs are to be met from renewable sources. Consumption of 
renewable energy will need to rise by 17% per annum to meet that goal.  


 

Figure 8: UK Renewable Energy Consumption (TWh)12 


 

Source: Energy Trends June 2011  

2.18 Different levels of growth will be required across the sectors given their varying 
stages of development. Renewable electricity will need to maintain a growth 
rate of approximately 15% per annum from the 2010 baseline of 28 TWh. The 
renewable heat market, which is at an earlier stage of development, will require 
higher levels of growth, over 19% per annum, to move from the 2010 baseline 
of 13 TWh13 to the projection of approximately 73 TWh by 2020.

Renewable Electricity 


 

Recent analysis14 shows that renewable electricity capacity increased by 15% between 2009 
and 2010, with onshore wind contributing the largest share. The total installed capacity was 
9.6 GW (including co-firing), which is in line with our overall projected growth. Total 
generation in 2010 was 25.7 TWh. However, the growth in generation between 2009 and 
2010 was less strong. This resulted from much lower than average rainfall and the lowest 
wind speeds this century, reducing hydropower and wind generation. 


  

Renewable Heat  


 

Renewable heat generated 14.1 TWh15 in 2010, of which biomass heat contributed 12.4 
TWh, solar thermal contributed 1 TWh, and heat pumps contributed 0.7 TWh.  This 
represents an increase of 17% from 2009 to 2010.

Current pipeline for renewable energy 


 

Pipeline for renewable electricity 


 

2.20 We expect renewable electricity generation to grow in line with our projections 
in the coming years. Analysis of the Renewable Energy Planning Database, 
summarised in Figure 9, suggests that the pipeline for new plant across the UK 
is currently healthy, with around 22 GW19 of potential new capacity in planning, 
consented or under construction. When taken together with existing capacity 
and accounting for historic consenting rates20, we could see around 29 GW in 
operation in 2020.   


 

2.21 However, the analysis also indicates that we cannot be certain that all the 

projects in the pipeline will be consented or commissioned or that they will 
progress quickly enough to contribute when needed. This is why the

At present we do not have verified statistics for renewable heat capacity; however, recent 
market estimates suggest a total installed capacity of at least 1.3 GWth16, which is broadly in 
line with our projections. 


 

Renewable Transport  


 

In 2009/10 the UK supplied 3.33% biofuels in road transport17 by volume, equating to 
1,568m litres of biofuels. This was slightly higher than the target of 3.25% required by the 
Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation Order and a significant increase on the 2.7% 
supplied in 2008/09. Energy generated from biofuels in renewable transport increased by 
23%, from 9.8 TWh in 2008 to 12.7 TWh in 2009. Provisional data for 2010 suggests further 
growth with biofuels contributing 14.1 TWh18.

Figure 9:  Pipeline for large scale electricity, including attrition rates22


  

2.22 Onshore wind is the biggest single contributor to the pipeline, with over 11 GW 

of capacity in planning, consented, or under construction. The offshore wind 
pipeline is currently near 6 GW and is expected to grow as site applications for 
Scottish Territorial Waters and Round 3 offshore wind are submitted for 
consideration from 2012. There is currently 4.3 GW of biomass electricity in the 
pipeline, including energy from waste23. However, we anticipate that the 
potential pipeline is higher than this, as many fossil fuel to biomass conversion 
projects are not currently captured within our statistics. In addition, co-firing 
biomass with coal – one of the most cost-effective means of producing 
renewable electricity – could provide up to 400 MW of capacity in 2011.   


 

2.23 An initial assessment of renewable electricity projects currently under 
construction24, suggests that a further 4 GW could come into operation by the 
end of 2012.

Pipeline for renewable heat 
2.24 Whilst we have evidence on renewable electricity, the available data on 

renewable heat is less well developed. Over the coming year DECC will gather 
data on installed heat and on the future pipeline based on available planning 
and permitting information, and market intelligence. This, together with 
information from preliminary accreditation of Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI)  
installations (driving up to an additional 100,000 heat pumps and an additional 
24,000 biomass heat25 installations by 2020), and the Renewable Heat 
Premium Payment (RHPP) for small scale, will allow us to track heat projects, 
analyse deployment trends and identify barriers to adoption. We will make 
updated data on heat publicly available. 


 

Pipeline for renewable transport 
2.25 The RTFO places an annual obligation on road transport fuels suppliers to 

supply a percentage of biofuels (subject to “buy out”). This is currently set to 
achieve 4% by energy (5% by volume) by 2014. However, as biofuel is a 
globally traded commodity the pipeline does not exist in the same way as it 
does for the other end use sectors of electricity and heat. Government will 
come forward with proposals for renewable transport between 2014 and 2020 
in order to achieve the 10% transport sub-target.  

Local potential for renewables deployment  

2.26 In addition to developing our understanding of deployment at the national scale, 
DECC has funded nine studies to help local authorities and local communities 
in England identify and maximise opportunities for the deployment of renewable 
and low carbon energy technologies in their area. The Scottish Government 
has developed a similar assessment of potential in Scotland. Local Authorities 
and communities will be able to use the results of these assessments to inform 
development of their local and neighbourhood development plans. 


 

2.27 Seven of the nine assessments for England are now available26 through the 

DECC web site. We aim to publish the final two assessments soon.

Box 4:  Assessment of the potential for renewables energy in the North West 
of England 


 

The ‘North West renewable and low carbon energy capacity and deployment project 
report’ has been developed in conjunction with stakeholders from across the region, 
according to the energy capacity assessment methodology published by DECC and CLG 
in 2010. 


 

The study is intended to assist Local Planning Authorities in preparing planning policies on 
renewables. 


 

The project has produced a comprehensive assessment of the potential accessible 
renewable energy resources at 2020.  The scenarios contained in the report for potential 
deployment of renewables are only intended to illustrate, given current constraints and 
trends, how the North West could contribute to national renewable energy deployment 
targets. 


 

While the focus of the project has been to present the results at sub-regional and sub-
national scales, much of the original data can be interrogated down to Local Authority level. 
This original data is available to Local Authorities to undertake their own analysis. 

Cumbria County Council working together with the District Councils and the Lake District 
National Park has commissioned work building on the North West study to identify the 
renewables and low carbon energy potential in Cumbria.  The study provides a 
comprehensive evidence base that will facilitate local planning authorities across Cumbria 
to develop well-founded policies that support renewable energy development

Conclusions from our analysis 

2.28 Our analysis suggests the following: 

• Even though we are starting from a low level the UK can meet the target to 
deliver 15% of the UK’s energy consumption from renewable sources by 
2020 through domestic deployment. Recent ‘bottom-up’ analysis, based on 
industry inputs, suggests that there is significant upside potential and 
downside risk to deployment; 

• Based on current information, and taking account of their long term potential 
as well as their cost effectiveness, 8 technologies are capable of delivering 
more than 90% of the renewable energy we estimate is required by 2020; 

• The pipeline of renewable electricity projects is healthy. Although, allowing 
for historic dropout rates27, it puts us on track to deliver approximately 29 
GW of capacity by 2020, significant uncertainties remain and we still urgently 
need new renewable projects to come forward to ensure we meet the 15% 
target and longer term carbon reduction targets; 

• The pipeline for renewable heat projects is less well developed but following 
the introduction of the world’s first incentive for renewable heat could deliver 
up to an additional 100,000 heat pumps and an additional 24,000 biomass 
heat28 installations by 2020;  

• Road transport biofuels are proposed to increase to 5% of road transport 
fuels by 2014. Subject to the results of current consultations, Government 
will come forward with options in Spring 2012 to stimulate further growth in 
renewable transport for the period after 2014; 

• Costs of renewable energy technologies are currently high and uncertain but 
are expected to fall over time as supply chains develop, technical challenges 
are overcome and technologies are demonstrated to be effective.

capacity.

Chapter 3:  Actions 
3.1 Government has worked with industry to identify the key challenges to increase 

the deployment of renewable energy in the UK. The main focus of this Chapter 
is on each of the 8 technologies that together could deliver more than 90% of 
the effort required for 2020. A number of actions also apply to a wide range of 
renewable technologies. These ‘cross cutting actions’ are described below. 

Cross-cutting actions 

3.2 Our work with industry indicates that there are at least six cross-cutting barriers 
to deployment which impact on more than one of the key technologies but that 
may not apply to all 8. Without alleviating these overarching challenges, the 
removal of technology-focused constraints could have a limited impact and may 
fail to unlock the capacity from individual technologies or bring down costs 
quickly enough. To create the right market conditions we are:   


 

• Facilitating access to the grid: Grid access arrangements can delay or 

prevent renewable electricity deployment on and offshore. Currently, 5.5 GW 
of renewable electricity projects with planning consent are waiting to be 
connected to the grid29. The construction of an offshore grid is critical for the 
deployment of offshore wind and also for future deployment of wave and tidal 
energy. We are taking action to reform the onshore grid and establish the 
framework offshore necessary to deploy the levels of renewable electricity we 
anticipate are necessary for 2020. 


 

• Ensuring long term investment certainty: Renewables developers and 

investors require certainty over incentives on which to base investment 
decisions. The total investment requirement to deliver 15% renewables for 
2020 and beyond to 2050 will run into hundreds of billions of pounds. We are 
putting in place a transparent and long lived financial framework through the 
introduction of incentives for heat and reforming the electricity market. As part 
of this we are taking action to ensure a managed transition from the 
Renewables Obligation, including bringing forward the Banding Review, to 
secure the 22 GW of renewable electricity capacity currently in the pipeline30 
as well as bring forward additional projects. 


 

• Tackling pre- and post- consent delays: We recognise the need to ensure 

that projects have as many benefits and as few adverse impacts as possible 
in financial, economic and environmental terms. However, delays in the 
planning process or difficulties in discharging conditions attached to consents 
can have a significant impact on deployment. This can impact across the 
range of technologies both on and offshore. For example, there is currently

5 GW of onshore and 7 GW of offshore wind capacity impacted by radar 
interference. We will ensure a radar replacement programme is rolled out this 
year. Government is also reforming the planning system for major 
infrastructure in England and Wales, to replace the Infrastructure Planning 
Commission with a democratically accountable system, and to ensure that 
local planning in England31 supports economic growth and gives local 
communities a greater say and stake in development.   


 

• Ensuring sustainable bioenergy feedstock supply: Bioenergy could, if 

suitable feedstocks are available, deliver around half of the total generation 
we estimate will be required to meet our 15% target by 2020. Concerns about 
the sustainability of bioenergy feedstocks could limit the use of bioenergy in 
the electricity, heat and transport sectors. We are putting in place 
sustainability standards, developing a Bioenergy Strategy to be clear about 
the availability and best use of this resource, and ensuring that sustainable 
feedstocks are fully exploited.  


 

• Facilitating development of renewables supply chains: Most technologies 
face some degree of supply chain constraint, whether for equipment, 
installers, or infrastructure, but the severity of these constraints will vary by 
technology. They will be particularly important, for example, in developing  
markets such as offshore wind, marine, heat pumps, and ultra low-emissions 
vehicles. The Government’s financial incentives for renewable energy will 
provide greater market confidence about future deployment levels, helping to 
stimulate supply chain development. In addition, we are taking specific 
measures to encourage the development of port and manufacturing facilities 
for offshore wind, Marine Energy Parks, charging infrastructure for plug-in 
vehicles, and plans for better certification and assessment of installers for 
small scale technologies, including domestic heat.  


 

• Encouraging innovation: Whilst some technologies needed for the 2020 

target are relatively mature, such as onshore wind and biomass boilers, others 
such as offshore wind and marine are not yet fully developed. By encouraging 
innovation in these areas Government can help developers overcome the 
remaining engineering challenges, lower cost, and improve the reliability of 
technologies used. This will reduce the overall cost of meeting the 2020 
renewables target and longer term carbon reduction targets, and the impact 
on public spending and consumer bills. We are committing an additional £50m 
over the next 4 years, subject to value for money assessment, to support 
innovation in offshore and marine technologies, and considering further 
allocation, including for energy from waste and biomass, details of which will 
be available in the Autumn.  


 

Technology Action Plans 

3.3 While renewable deployment across all technologies will be important, the 
Roadmap focuses in particular on the 8 technologies which have either the 

                                            
31 Some elements of planning are devolved, therefore there are differences across the UK.

greatest potential to help the UK meet the 2020 target in a cost effective and 
sustainable way, or offer the greatest potential for the decades that follow. This 
Chapter sets out a plan for each of the 8. Within each plan we have: 


 

• Estimated changes in capacity and growth rate: Using the current levels of 

deployment, an understanding from the market of deployment potential, and 
where it exists, data about the capacity in the pipeline, we have estimated the 
increase in capacity and growth rate that is consistent with meeting our 2020 
target;   


 

• Identified challenges to deployment: We have undertaken work to better 
understand the journey to deployment, from scoping and application, to 
consent, development and final operation. Taking a systematic approach in 
this way enables us to better understand the key constraints and bottlenecks 
to deployment.     


 

• Developed a bespoke package of actions: Combining our understanding of 
the challenges to deployment with evidence from the pipeline to identify the 
scale of the risk. This has informed the development of a bespoke package of 
actions that address the most immediate challenges to deployment for each 
technology.    


 

3.4 This is the first set of plans. We will continue to gather evidence about 

deployment to better understand the challenges and will update our approach 
annually.

Onshore wind  

• The UK has more than 4 GW of installed onshore wind capacity in operation 
(generating approximately 7 TWh of electricity annually) 32.  

• The central range for deployment indicates that onshore wind could contribute up to  
around 13 GW by 2020. Achieving this level of capacity equates to an annual growth 
rate of 13%33.  

• The existing pipeline for onshore wind contains an additional 11 GW. When taken 
together with the existing operational capacity, this could contribute a significant 
proportion of the central range for 2020 given historic planning approval rates although 
there are concerns with the pace at which capacity can be brought through34. 

• Challenges to deployment include: minimising investment risk; reform the planning 
system; overcoming radar interference from windfarms; and ensuring cost-effective grid 
investment and connection.   


  

    Priority actions:  

• Minimise investment risk: Implement proposed electricity market reform and RO 
transition measures to secure long term certainty to 2020 and beyond and enable 
historically strong investor confidence in onshore wind to be maintained. 

• Reform the planning system in England and Wales: Set out the national need for new 
renewable energy infrastructure through ratification of National Policy Statements. 
Replace the Infrastructure Planning Commission with a fast track process for major 
infrastructure projects. Reform the local planning system in England to ensure that it 
supports economic growth, give communities a greater say and stake in development, 
and help local authorities and communities to identify opportunities for the deployment 
of renewables using analysis from regional studies. Improve guidance on issues of 
public concern such as noise impact to ensure high quality planning decisions.  

• Overcome radar interference with windfarms: Work with the signatories of a new 
Memorandum of Understanding to develop, fund and implement radar mitigation 
programmes over the first half of this decade. Jointly fund, with industry and the Crown 
Estate, a new early warning radar system for RAF Trimingham. 

• Ensure cost-effective grid investment and connection

Current deployment 

: Work with Ofgem through Project 
TransmiT to help plan grid investments and the regime for charging new connections to 
the transmission network. National Grid will consult later this summer on long-term 
financial security arrangements including Final Sums Liability. Monitor the impact of 
“Connect and Manage”, and take corrective actions if necessary. 

3.5 There is currently 4 GW of operational onshore wind capacity in the UK, 
generating  around 7 TWh annually. In capacity terms, this is the single most 
deployed renewable electricity technology and is most established in Scotland 
(~2.5 GW), where over 60% of UK wind resource is found, followed by England 
(~0.9 GW), Wales (~0.4 GW) and Northern Ireland (~0.3 GW).

34The assumed success rate for pipeline projects is based on observed success rates for projects determined 
between 2007 and 2011. Nation-specific success rates were calculated for pre-consent projects (to reflect the 
fact that planning arrangements differ across the UK). For post-consent projects a UK-wide figure was used

Deployment potential 
3.6 Figure 10 sets out results of recent analysis of potential growth for onshore 

wind to 2020. It overlays an industry view of the deployment that could be 
achieved (the ‘industry high’ and ‘industry low’ scenarios) around a model-
based central range.  


 

3.7 The central range indicates that we could see up to around 13 GW of onshore 
wind capacity by 2020. The majority of this would be from large scale projects 
over 5 MW. Achieving this 9 GW increase would require an annual growth rate 
of 13% over the next decade, slightly less than the growth rate experienced 
between 2009-201035. The industry scenarios suggests the potential to bring 
forward a total of between 10-19 GW of onshore wind by 2020 (equivalent to 
23-45 TWh). 


 

Figure 10: Deployment potential to 2020 for onshore wind 


 

3.8 The industry low scenario of 10 GW assumes that the ability to build and install 
turbines is a limiting factor for deployment. The industry high scenario of 19 GW  
assumes that build rate is not a limiting factor and that capacity currently in the 
pipeline is consented and moves rapidly to construction. It also assumes that 
growth slows after 2015 due to a limit on the number of sites available, growth 
of competing technologies and cumulative planning impacts. 

3.9 Analysis36 suggests that the levelised cost of onshore wind could range from 
£71-£122MWh in 2020, down only marginally from £75-£127 in 2010. Cost

reductions are expected to be limited as onshore wind is a mature technology, 
restricting the scope for further learning or technological progress as 
deployment increases. Cost ranges are wide however, reflecting variation in 
stakeholders views about capital cost, driven by project specific factors such as 
the location of windfarms and scale.  

Deployment pipeline 
3.10 As illustrated in Figure 11, there is currently over 11 GW of onshore wind 

capacity currently under construction, awaiting construction, or in planning in 
the UK.  


 

Figure 11: Capacity of onshore wind projects in the planning pipeline37 


 

3.11 Assuming historic consent rates38 the existing planning pipeline could deliver 
8.9 GW which, taken with current capacity, would provide a level of growth 
consistent with the high end of the central range.  


 

3.12 This pipeline capacity is distributed across the UK with the majority in Scotland 

(over 6.5 GW), over 2 GW in England, a further 1.5 GW in Wales, and 1.0 GW 
in Northern Ireland. Of the applications currently awaiting planning consent, 
over 88% (totalling 2.7 GW) are under 50 MW and will be decided at local 
level39. The remaining 12% of projects (totalling 3.6 GW) are 50 MW or over 
and are awaiting decision from the Government or relevant Devolved 
Administration.

3.13 By tackling the challenges to deployment outlined below, we will, subject to 
local consent decisions, help projects which are currently in the pipeline to 
commission. New proposals will also be required to come forward to meet the 
2020 ambition and longer term decarbonisation. 

Journey to deployment 
3.14 Figure 12 presents a developer journey map for onshore wind. This outlines the 

stages of the delivery process for onshore wind projects in England and the 
delivery partners who contribute to it (the process is similar in the rest of the 
UK, but there are some differences at the planning stages). The average time 
from identifying a site to exporting electricity to the grid is around five years, 
although this masks considerable variation by project. The process for 
developing a larger scale project is illustrated below, with key areas of 
challenge highlighted in red. To increase the build rates and shorten 
development time, we must tackle the barriers set out below. 


 

Figure 12: Developer journey map for the deployment of onshore wind projects 


 

Challenges to deployment and actions 
3.15 Our discussions with industry and analysis of deployment statistics suggest that 

developers must overcome at least four main challenges to deploy onshore 
wind projects. 


 

Minimise investment risk 


 

3.16 Developers require a degree of certainty about returns if they are to make 

confident investment decisions. Investor confidence in this proven technology is 
high, though currently tempered by perceived uncertainty about the level and 
surety of long-term financial support from Government. This has affected both 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


34 


the quantity of investment utilities can fund from their balance sheets and the 
quantity and cost of project finance available to developers. 


 

3.17 The Government has set out its plans to reform the electricity market alongside 

this Roadmap. This will include steps to improve the market’s ability to finance 
the investment in low carbon electricity that is needed over the next decade and 
beyond. It will put in place a transparent and long-term financial framework for 
low carbon electricity, including renewable power, structured around a new 
Feed-in-Tariff with Contracts-for-Difference. Northern Ireland will consider how 
these proposals can work in their All Island Energy market. 


 

3.18 In implementing this change, the Government will ensure a smooth transition 

from the Renewables Obligation (RO). In particular, once the new scheme is 
introduced, new generators will have the choice between the two schemes until 
2017 and following the closure of the RO to new entrants, technology payments 
made under the RO will be grandfathered40. In addition, the Government has 
accelerated the current Banding Review to provide clarity sooner on future 
support levels under the RO – Government will consult in summer 2011 and 
publish its decision by the end of the year, one year earlier than originally 
planned.  


 

3.19 Discussions over the participation of the Devolved Administrations in the new 

support mechanisms are on-going. All jurisdictions are committed to support 
renewables and if they propose to close their RO support mechanisms in due 
course, Scotland and Northern Ireland will consider doing so alongside England 
and Wales, on the basis of transition arrangements in the EMR White Paper 


 

Actions: 
• DECC will consult on new RO banding levels in summer 2011 and publish its 

decisions by the end of the year. New banding levels for onshore wind will 
come into force in April 2013. 

• DECC will put in place arrangements to ensure a smooth transition from the 
Renewables Obligation to the new electricity market support mechanism. 


 

Reforming the planning system 


 

3.20 The planning system plays a central role in delivering the infrastructure we 

need to reduce our carbon emissions, to ensure continued security of energy 
supply and help our economy to grow. It has a vital role in safeguarding our 
landscape and natural heritage and allowing individual communities the 
opportunity to shape their environment. 


 

3.21 UK consent rates for onshore wind projects vary from around 60% in Scotland 

and Wales, to 80% in Northern Ireland and 54% in England41.  Developers 
remain concerned about the time taken to decide applications, a lack of 
transparency, and apparent inconsistency across the UK in the way decisions 

                                            
40 Grandfathering is a policy that support levels should not change once generation has been accredited under 
a scheme, thereby providing investors greater certainty. 
41 Projects submitted to planning since 2007 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap

are reached. For their part, communities may be concerned about the possible 
impacts of windfarms and associated grid infrastructure on landscapes and 
local amenity. This has led to a situation where many developments are 
approved on appeal - over 50% of UK sub-50MW42 onshore wind projects 
rejected by local planning committees are eventually approved through this 
route.  


 

3.22 These factors increase cost, delay or risk revenue, and could deter developers 

from making applications in the first place or lead them to drop applications if 
initially rejected. This risks both the 6GW of onshore wind currently awaiting 
determination in the UK and projects which have not yet come forward. 


 

3.23 The Localism Bill will reform the planning system for major infrastructure 

projects over 50MW in England and Wales, once National Policy Statements 
are ratified. The Government laid its energy National Policy Statements before 
Parliament on 23 June for approval, setting out the national need for new 
energy infrastructure in the UK. These will set the decision-making framework 
for applications for nationally significant energy infrastructure, including 
renewable energy. The new planning system sets a time limit of nine months 
for the Infrastructure Planning Commission to determine applications from the 
start of examination. Under the Localism Bill, the Government has introduced 
plans to replace the Infrastructure Planning Commission with a new Major 
Infrastructure Planning Unit within the Planning Inspectorate43. The new Unit 
will consider applications for energy infrastructure and advise the Secretary of 
State for Energy and Climate Change, who will determine applications. The 
Government will review the effectiveness of this regime once a range of cases 
have been through it.  


 

3.24 The Government believes that the current local planning system is too 
centralised and costly and disempowers communities. It has failed to deliver 
the development that the country needs. That is why we are introducing 
fundamental reform to make sure that the planning system, supported by 
powerful new financial incentives, makes the right land available in the right 
places for development, and will deliver the development and smaller scale 
infrastructure that is needed.  


 

3.25 Projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support 

and the consent of local communities. This means giving communities both a 
say and a stake, in appropriately-sited renewable energy projects like 
windfarms. The Localism Bill is returning decision-making powers on housing 
and planning to local councils. 


 

3.26 The Government is introducing powerful new incentives to encourage support 

for new development. We have committed to allowing communities that host 
renewable energy projects to keep the additional business rates they generate 
and this is being taken forward through the Local Government Resource

Review. Renewable energy development can also bring economic growth and 
new jobs for the UK both locally and nationally. 


 

Case study:  Mabey Bridge Ltd 

Based in Chepstow, South Wales, Mabey Bridge has a 
turnover of £80 million and close to 500 employees. The 
company's history can be traced back to the construction 
of Brunel's Wye railway bridge in 1849.  


 

Mabey Bridge’s UK Division specialises in the fabrication, 
erection and protective treatment of high quality plated 
steelwork for bridges, wind turbine towers, monopiles and 
other heavy steel structures in the UK and Ireland. 


 

The Bevil Mabey Structural Steelworks, opened on 12th May 2011, is part of the 
company's £38 million investment in the renewable energy sector. The new facility, the 
UK’s only indigenous manufacturer of wind turbine towers and monopiles, has created 
some 240 jobs in addition to the 400 already employed by the company in Chepstow and 
Lydney. 


 

The 25,000 square metre facility will make up to 300 
wind turbine towers per annum, each up to 120m long. 
The factory uses the latest manufacturing 
techniques including computer controlled cutting and 
rolling, robotic welding, and an automated painting 
facility and will put South Wales at the heart of the 
move towards a low carbon economy. 


 

3.27 The Government will shortly consult on a new National Planning Policy 

Framework for England, to consolidate existing planning policy (including for 
energy projects below 50MW) into a single document. The framework will 
include a new presumption in favour of sustainable development.  


 

3.28 In addition, the Government has committed to consulting later this year on a 

package of measures that will streamline and simplify planning applications in 
England. Furthermore, in the Plan for Growth (March 2011), the Government 
announced its intention to introduce a ‘planning guarantee’ that it would take no 
more than 12 months to reach a final decision on planning applications, 
including any associated appeal.    


 

3.29 In Wales, Planning Policy Wales (PPW) was updated earlier this year to 

provide guidance on renewable and low carbon energy projects. This is 
supplemented by Technical Advice Note 8 Renewable Energy (TAN8), and the 
Local Development Plan system which enables communities and businesses to 
shape future development in their areas.  


 

3.30 In Scotland, work is also being coordinated by the Scottish Government to 

develop good practice in reconciling objectives for the deployment of onshore, 
and offshore, wind with wider environmental objectives, and actively involving 
communities in planning and implementation. The GP (Good Practice) Wind 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


37 


project involves stakeholders from eight European countries and will produce a 
Good Practice Guide and the "how to" toolkit which will provide valuable online 
resources for industry, NGOs, policy makers, local and regional authorities, and 
local communities. 


 

3.31 To inform all planning decision making, DECC will ensure that an up-to-date 

evidence base is available on the potential impacts of wind turbines, such as 
noise and shadow flicker (for which DECC published research recently), 
intermittency, and implications for landscape, habitats and species. It has also 
helped local authorities and communities to identify opportunities for the 
deployment of renewables using analysis from regional studies. 


 

3.32 As outlined in the Microgeneration Strategy44, the Government recognises that 

community scale generation can provide significant economies of scale as well 
as benefits to the local community, and will provide more information to support 
their development through DECC’s  Community Energy Online web portal. 


 

Actions:   
• Set the decision making framework for projects of nationally significant 

infrastructure, including renewables, through the ratification of the National 
Planning Statements 

• DCLG will consult on the new draft National Planning Policy Framework for 
England in summer 2011.  

• The Local Government Resource Review will publish proposals to allow local 
retention of business rates, including those relating to renewable energy 
projects in July 2011. 

• DCLG will publish details of a ‘planning guarantee’ by the end of the year with 
the intention that it will take no longer than 12 months to reach a final decision 
on planning applications including any associated appeal.  

• The GP Wind Project, coordinated by the Scottish Government, will deliver its 
good practice guide and a ‘how to’ toolkit in Spring 2012. 


 

Overcome radar interference with windfarms  


 

3.33 Onshore and offshore windfarms can interfere with aviation radar systems. This 

leads to planning objections by both civil aviation operators, such as airports 
and National Air Traffic System (NATS), and by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) 
for air defence and air traffic control radar. In this case, impact on radar must 
be mitigated in order for planning conditions to be discharged and construction 
to proceed.   


 

3.34 This has become one of the most significant non-financial barriers constraining 

the deployment of wind. We estimate that around 5 GW of onshore and 7 GW 
of offshore wind projects in scoping, planning, and awaiting construction may 
be impacted by radar. In addition, there is currently 1.9 GW of onshore wind 
capacity ‘awaiting construction’ which was consented over two years ago, and

UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


38 


industry estimate the majority of this is held up by the need for developers to 
meet planning conditions related to radar45.  


 

3.35 DECC has worked with developers and others to fund research and 

development into technical solutions to upgrade radar and mitigate the 
problems caused by windfarms. This includes a direct contribution to funding 
R&D into upgrade solutions for NATS’ fleet of radar, which deliver en-route 
services to aircraft flying over the UK. The Government has also helped 
facilitate the wind industry’s funding for Cambridge Consultants holographic in-
fill radar solutions, which can be deployed at specific windfarms to mitigate 
against interference with terminal radar at airports, and interference with NATS 
infrastructure. If this R&D results in successful implementation of solutions, it 
will enable several planning conditions relating to radar interference to be 
discharged and construction of windfarms to proceed. This will also free-up 
potential future wind developments in the impacted areas.  


 

3.36 These technical solutions are now beginning to emerge and become available.  

However, to-date funding into R&D has been managed on a case by case 
basis, and the next step – moving to implementation of the technical solutions – 
relies on the ability and willingness of leading developers to fund the upgrades, 
regardless of how many other developers may benefit in the future. This 
piecemeal approach has led to uncertainty and additional costs on these 
developers and can reduce the incentive to invest.   


 

3.37 Today the Government is announcing the signing of a new Memorandum of 

Understanding, which commits the signatories to move from supporting R&D, to 
ensuring that the software and hardware solutions identified are implemented, 
and to begin to look for solutions to other windfarm-related aviation problems, 
such as navigation and communications services. 


 

3.38 The technological complexity of the radar interference problem means that a 
single technical solution is not possible, and a suite of different solutions needs 
to be developed. However, a generic approach to rolling out and applying 
technical solutions, and support for regional approaches where they are 
possible, will incentivise investment in the necessary infrastructure, and so 
enable onshore and offshore wind deployment that would otherwise not be 
possible.  DECC will continue to work with DfT, the MOD, the wind industry and 
aviation partners to make progress towards this goal. 


 

3.39 An example of the potential impact of radar on deployment of wind can be 

found in the Greater Wash, where the MOD had concerns about the impact of 
five large scale projects on defence radar at Trimingham on the Norfolk coast. 
DECC agreed to contribute £4 million towards development of a new radar that 
will become operational in November 2011. This will facilitate the development 
of 2 GW of offshore wind in the Greater Wash and has the potential to free up a 
further 6 GW.

Actions: 
• DECC will work with the signatories of a new Memorandum of Understanding to

civilian aviation radar over the next few years.  

• DECC is jointly funding, with industry and The Crown Estate, a new early-
warning radar system for the MOD based at RAF Trimingham.  


 

Case study:  Scottish and Southern Energy’s Clyde windfarm 

SSE (Scottish and 
Southern Energy plc) 
has produced the first 
electricity from its 
Clyde windfarm in 
South Lanarkshire. 
Once completed the 
350 MW windfarm, 
Europe’s biggest single 
consented onshore 
windfarm, will comprise 
152 turbines and 
generate enough power for 270,000 homes. The first of the windfarm’s three sections 
should be finished by the end of this year and the whole of the farm in 2012. An 
agreement between SSE and NATS (en route) plc on arrangements to maintain a safe 
and efficient air traffic control service over the site has been reached, while the 
construction of the permanent new primary radar facility is completed.  

The windfarm represents an investment of £500 million. More than 200 construction jobs 
are being created while the windfarm is being built and after it is set up and running a staff 
of 30 will be employed to operate and maintain the site. 


 

Ensure cost-effective grid investment and connection 


 

3.40 To deliver the quantity of onshore wind for 2020 indicated in the central range, 

the UK will need to substantially upgrade its onshore transmission capacity – 
overcoming finance, coordination and planning challenges to do so – and 
ensure that developers secure timely and cost-effective access to the network.  


 

3.41 Currently, some developers report concerns about the transmission charges 

they face (particularly in remote locations including some parts of Scotland and 
Wales) and the ‘Final Sums Liabilities’ they must provide before new lines are 
put up46 .  


 

3.42 Timeliness of connection is much less of an issue than it used to be, with over 

1.8 GW of onshore wind projects advancing their connection dates by an 
average of around four years since 2009 due to the introduction of the ‘Connect

and Manage’ arrangements. However, some £4.7bn47 of investment will be 
required in the onshore grid in the years to 2020 to maintain progress and 
accommodate the overall level of renewable electricity needed by 2020. 
Without investment, much of the additional capacity of up to 13 GW of onshore 
wind by 2020 anticipated in the central range could be at risk.  


 

3.43 To incentivise the necessary network investment, Ofgem introduced a new 

framework for approving investment proposals (“RIIO”48) and will ensure that 
Transmission Owners’ business plans, approved under this framework, are 
implemented by Spring 2013. In addition, DECC has asked the Electricity 
Networks Strategy Group (ENSG) to update its assessment of the transmission 
network investment required to 2020 and, from June, to put in place a process 
to monitor delivery of this investment. DECC has, in the National Policy 
Statements, set out the need for new transmission infrastructure in the UK, 
providing a basis for the consideration of future planning applications for 
nationally significant infrastructure. In Northern Ireland the approval of 
investment proposals is undertaken by the Utility Regulator for Northern Ireland 
through its Regulatory Price Control process. The Utility Regulator is currently 
consulting on the price control which will cover the period 2012-2017.   


 

3.44 To ensure timely and cost-effective connection of distributed generation, Ofgem 

issued an Open Letter requesting views by the end of May 2011 on the 
challenges to connecting to the distribution network. In addition, it is using 
Project TransmiT49 to review the connection and transmission charging regime, 
with a view to making any appropriate changes by April 2012. Recent reforms 
have reduced the average level of Final Sum Liabilities required of companies, 
but in response to continuing concerns from developers National Grid intends 
to publish a consultation on further proposals on financial security 
arrangements later this year. It will aim to implement any changes required by 
April 2012.   


 

Actions: 
• National Grid will publish a consultation on proposals for suitable long term 

financial security arrangements in summer 2011, with implementation of any 
changes required by April 2012. 

• DECC will designate the National Policy Statements in July 2011, subject to 
their approval by Parliament, setting out the need for new transmission 
infrastructure 

• Ofgem is reviewing the transmission charging regime through Project TransmiT 
and plans to implement any changes required by April 2012. 

• Transmission Owners’ business plans – approved by Ofgem through the RIIO 
framework – will be implemented in spring 2013.

Offshore wind  

• The UK is the global leader for offshore wind energy with 1.3 GW of operational capacity 
across 15 windfarms (which generated over 3 TWh during 2010)50.  

• The UK is well placed to continue this lead role to 2020 and beyond. The central range 
indicates that up to 18 GW could be deployed by 2020. Beyond 2020 there is a very 
high potential for deployment with over 40 GW possible by 203051.  

• Increasing the rate of deployment to realise this potential will require substantial 
reduction in costs. This necessitates action over and above what is already planned to 
help industry minimise investment risk, develop the supply chain, ensure cost-effective 
grid investment and connection, secure consents, and access finance. 


 

 Priority actions: 


 

We are determined to drive down costs and are establishing an industry Task Force to 
set out a path and action plan to reduce the costs of offshore wind, from development, 
construction and operations to £100/MWh by 2020. This will be supported by up to 
£30m, subject to value-for-money assessment, to foster collaboration between 
technology developers and support innovation in the production of components over the 
next 4 years. This builds on existing support to increase the rate of innovation and 
develop the supply chain.     


 

• Innovate to reduce costs


• 

: Deliver a coordinated portfolio of investment in offshore wind 
innovation including support of up to £30m in 2011-2015 to reduce costs through 
technology development and demonstration. Establish an offshore renewables 
Technology and Innovation Centre (TIC). The Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) will 
provide £25m investment in a drive train test facility at the National Renewable Energy 
Centre (NaREC).   
Develop the supply chain


• 

: Provide up to £60m for the development of wind 
manufacturing facilities at ports; work with high-value added manufacturers to exploit 
supply chain opportunities. The Scottish Government will provide £70m to strengthen 
port and manufacturing facilities for offshore wind turbines and components in 
Scotland.  
Minimise investment risk


• 

: Complete accelerated  RO Banding Review, implement 
electricity market reform, and put in place EMR-RO transition arrangements 
Access finance


• 

:  Offshore wind will be a strong candidate for support from the Green 
Investment Bank (GIB). Work with developers and investors through the Offshore Wind 
Developers Forum to identify the investment capital required for offshore wind and 
whether further Government action is appropriate. Take action to reduce investor 
uncertainty in relation to oil and gas clause in offshore windfarm leases. 
Ensure cost-effective grid investment and connection


• 

: Offshore Transmission 
Coordination Project review of incentives for coordination to ensure coordinated 
development of Round 3 offshore transmission assets. Develop long-term position on 
security requirements for grid connection. Grid actions set out above are also relevant 
to offshore wind.

Current deployment 
3.45 The UK is the largest market for offshore wind energy in the world with an 

installed capacity of over 1.3 GW, around 4 GW post-consent, and some 2 GW 
in the planning system. Current operational capacity is located relatively close 
to shore in 15 windfarms in the North and Irish Seas and Scottish Territorial 
Waters (STW). 


 

Figure 13: Offshore wind activity in United Kingdom Waters  

The Crown Estate, which owns most of the 
seabed out to the 12 nautical mile territorial 
limit, has granted leases to developers in a 
series of rounds 


 

Round 1 leases are typically close to shore, 
and have been mostly installed already – they 
total around 1 GW of capacity. Round 2 
identified three strategic areas, totalling       
7.2 GW, which are under construction or in 
development and will be responsible for the 
capacity additions expected over the next 3-4 
years.  


 

Round 3 leases offer up to 32 GW of new 
generation in 9 zones, which are significantly 
larger than the areas identified under Rounds 
1 and 2 and likely to use larger turbines. Many 
of the Round 3 zones are in deeper water, 
further offshore, and are therefore more 
technically challenging. The Crown Estate 
also granted exclusivity agreements in 2009 
for the development of 6.4 GW in Scottish 
Territorial Waters. Northern Ireland is 
considering a leasing round of at least 
600MW, subject to consultation.  


 

In order to provide a stable flow of construction projects to the offshore wind industry, in 
May 2010 the Crown Estate also announced an additional 2 GW capacity by way of 
extensions to a number of awarded leases. 


 

Deployment potential 


 

3.46 Figure 14 sets out results of recent analysis of the potential for growth in 

offshore wind generation to 2020. It suggests that industry has the potential to 
bring forward between 10 and 26 GW by 2020 (‘industry low’ and ‘industry high’ 
scenarios), with a central range of up to 18 GW. Achieving the top of central 
range would require an annual growth rate of up to 30%.  


 

3.47 The UK has the best offshore wind resources in Europe. Recent independent 
analysis for DECC suggests that the UK can maintain its place as global leader 
in offshore wind with the potential to deploy over 40 GW by 2030. Such 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


44 


significant capacity, enough to power the equivalent of all the homes in the UK, 
can play a vital role in increasing our energy security and decarbonising power 
generation. 


 

3.48 The Committee on Climate Change recommended in their recent advice that, 
unless there is clear evidence of cost reduction, the UK ambition for offshore 
wind should be limited to 13 GW by 2020. If industry, with Government support, 
can drive down costs, we will be able to go faster and further, ensuring that the 
full economic and energy security benefits of our offshore wind resource comes 
to the UK rather than our competitors. We are determined to achieve these 
gains, which is why we are:  


 

• Providing a further £30m of direct Government innovation support for 
offshore wind cost reduction. This is in addition to £28m for offshore wind 
applications under the Environmental Transformation Fund (ETF), the £30m 
already committed to NaREC, the recently announced £25m by the ETI, and 
£60m provided for the development of manufacturing facilities at port sites; 


 

• Establishing a Task Force with industry to set out an action plan for cost 
reduction to 2020. The Task Force will drive the work necessary to realise 
the vision of reaching £100/MWh for offshore wind, making it cost 
competitive with a large proportion of the 30-40 GW of low carbon 
generation which will be necessary in the 2020s to deliver the 4th Carbon 
Budget. The group will be chaired by a senior industry figure and will involve 
industry, Government and the Crown Estate. The Crown Estate will play a 
key role in facilitating this work through the analysis it has initiated on cost 
reduction pathways.  


 

3.49 Industry indicate that cost reductions of this challenging level can be achieved 

over the next decade through a combination of technology progression, 
industrialisation and greater supply chain competition, combined with 
favourable exchange rate and other external conditions.  


 

3.50 The Task Force will consider evidence from The Crown Estate, industry and 
others on present and future costs, the key determinants of cost at each stage 
of the value chain, and which of these should be targeted for action. Its 
recommendations, which will be jointly developed by industry and Government 
and reported to Minsters, will be used to inform future iterations of the 
Roadmap, including the deployment potential for offshore wind. 


 

3.51 Significant cost reductions of this kind would see much greater levels of growth 
towards the end of the decade. For example, if costs were to fall to £100/MWh, 
then the cumulative offshore wind deployment in 2020 could increase 
deployment a further 5 GW by 2020 above the level set out by the CCC. It 
would enable industry to unlock the full potential of the UK’s offshore resources 
and provide contingency should the levels of large scale renewable energy 
anticipated from other technologies fail to be realised.  


  

UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


45 


Figure 14: Deployment potential to 2020 for offshore wind 


    

3.52 Being able to deploy at scale and at reduced cost would also position the UK 

strongly to exploit commercial opportunities for greater generation in the North 
Sea. We have abundant wind resource and should explore the possibility of 
exporting energy generated in UK waters to mainland Europe. This could 
mean, for example, that our European neighbours fund the deployment of 
additional capacity in UK waters for their own consumption leading to even 
greater business benefits for the UK. We will take powers as early as 
practicable to enable the “two-way” trade in renewable energy with other 
Member States where this can secure the greatest benefit for the UK.    


 

Deployment pipeline  


 

3.53 Figure 15 provides a breakdown of the current offshore wind planning pipeline 

and the effect of current drop-out rates on final development. Offshore wind has 
historically benefitted from a very low dropout rate with only 7% of projects 
being lost from the pipeline52. Taking historic dropout rates into account, there 
are almost 6 GW of Round 1 and 2 offshore wind projects currently in 
construction, awaiting construction, or in planning. When the deployment 
pipeline is taken together with the capacity currently in operation this represents 
7 GW

UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


46 


Figure 15: Capacity of offshore wind projects in the planning pipeline53 


 

3.54 To deliver further deployment, projects will also need to come forward from 
Round 3 zones and extensions awarded, STW sites, and the forthcoming 
Northern Ireland leasing round. Individual projects within the Round 3 zones 
are at the pre-application stage, and are likely to enter the planning and 
consenting process from late 2012 onwards. 


 

Journey to deployment 


 

3.55 Figure 16 below is a developer journey map for offshore wind projects. It 

outlines the delivery system for offshore wind developments in UK waters. Up 
to now the average time for progressing to operation is 4-6 years. The chart 
below shows the development process and likely timings for a typical offshore 
wind project and highlights the greatest risks to deployment in red. To increase 
the build rates, shorten development time, and reduce costs, we must tackle 
the barriers set out below.

Challenges to deployment and actions 
3.56 We recognise the importance of offshore wind to the achievement of our 

renewables target, and the long term potential to contribute to the 
decarbonisation of the energy sector necessary under the 4th Carbon Budget. 


 

3.57 In addition to the specific challenges and actions set out below, we also need to 

prioritise the driving down of costs of offshore wind energy to the make the 
technology sustainable in the longer term. Government is already supporting 
work to increase the rate of innovation to bring down costs, including by 
supporting test facilities and deciding to establish an offshore renewables TIC. 
The ETI has recently announced that it will invest £25m into an open access 
wind turbine drive train test rig to be sited at NaREC in Blyth. DECC is 
announcing today that it will provide up to £30m over the next 4 years to foster 
collaboration between technology developers and to support innovations in the 
production of components.  


 

3.58 We will prioritise work with the industry and The Crown Estate to identify where 

efforts can be focused to reduce the costs of offshore energy throughout the 
value chain from development, construction and operations. As set out above, 
we will establish a Task Force with industry to set out an action plan for cost 
reduction to 2020. We will also work though the Offshore Wind Developers 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


48 


Forum (OWDF) and its supply chain sub-group to support the development of 
the UK supply chain.  


 

Innovate to reduce costs 


 

3.59 Offshore wind is at an earlier stage of development than onshore, with designs 
that are still evolving and costs which are significantly higher – driven in part by 
the need for greater reliability, given the harsher operating environment and the 
difficulty in gaining access for maintenance and repair. 


 

3.60 To deploy at the scale suggested by our analysis it will be crucial to reduce 

costs – for manufacturing, installing, operating and maintaining offshore 
windfarms. Innovation, to improve efficiency and decrease installation costs will 
have a significant role to play in reducing the cost of energy, which will in turn 
support increased deployment and help boost the UK supply chain.  Some 
Round 3 zones will also require innovation to develop larger turbines, 
foundations in deep water sites, and drive train technologies.   


 

3.61 To help address that challenge the members of the Government’s Low Carbon 

Innovation Group54 are working together and with the Devolved 
Administrations and others to provide a coordinated and broad portfolio of 
support to innovation in offshore wind. Key parts of that portfolio include: 


 

o UK Government support to the development of shared industry testing 
and proving facilities – such as the new 100-metre blade testing facility 
and  offshore wind turbine testing sites at NaREC in Blyth; 


 

o The ETI recent announcement that it will invest £25m into an open access 
wind turbine drive train test rig based at NaREC. 


 

o The Technology Strategy Board’s funding to establish an offshore 
renewables TIC; 


 

o The ongoing offshore wind innovation programmes of the ETI, which 
focuses on reliability, cost reduction, and supply-chain development of 
technologies optimised for the offshore wind sector; 


 

o The work of the Carbon Trust, which has committed in the region of £4m 
this financial year to continue the Offshore Wind Accelerator; 


 

o The Research Council’s Offshore Wind Supergen programme with the 
principal objective of the current phase being to undertake research to 
achieve an integrated, cost-effective, reliable and available Offshore Wind 
Power Station.  


 

3.62 Testing facilities have been recognised as having a key role to play in the 

offshore wind sector. Demonstration of what in many cases will be cutting edge 
new technology in a controlled environment is required before mass 
deployment can take place, and will support cost reduction and provide 

                                            
54 The Low Carbon Innovation Group core membership includes: the Department of Energy and Climate 
Change (DECC), the Department of Business Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Carbon Trust, the Research 
Councils, the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) and the Technology Strategy Board. 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


49 


investment confidence. We will support the development of the shared industry 
testing and proving facilities where possible to help lower technology costs and 
improve reliability. 


 

3.63 The recently announced wind turbine test rig funded by ETI will be capable of 

testing complete drive trains and nacelles for prototype turbines up to 15 MW, 
in a purpose built, onshore test facility. Accelerated lifetime testing of turbines 
will help reduce the technical and commercial risks of mass production and 
deployment before moving to challenging offshore conditions. It will provide 
both a lower cost alternative to deploying and testing turbines offshore, and will 
accelerate the development of new prototypes for low cost, more reliable 
machines, increasing the speed of deployment. It should be available for 
commercial testing from June 2013.  


 

3.64 To complement those investments, DECC will set-aside up to £30m over the 

next 4 years for offshore wind innovation which, subject to satisfactory value for 
money assessments, will be used to fund schemes to drive cost reductions in 
components and technologies for offshore wind systems and to foster 
collaboration between offshore wind developers to address common 
challenges. 


 

Actions: 
• Delivery of a coordinated portfolio of support to offshore wind including: the 

establishment of an offshore renewables TIC; the continued development of 
offshore wind energy testing facilities; and, subject to value for money 
assessment, DECC will be providing up to £30m over the next four years which 
will support innovation to reduce costs.  


 

Case study:  Belfast Harbour Development as Offshore Renewables Hub 

Belfast Harbour, a deep water port with 
no tidal restrictions offering year-round  
access, gives offshore energy investors 
the ability to build the robust supply 
chain solutions they need. Already host 
to Harland and Wolff Heavy Industries’ 
logistical supply base, in February 
2011,  

Belfast Harbour announced plans with 
DONG Energy, which are now being 
finalised, to develop a new £50m, 50 
acre offshore logistics hub as a base 
for its Irish Sea construction operations.  

This marks a significant investment and creates a large number of jobs in Belfast, during 
the construction phase and its subsequent use as a pre-assembly facility. A further 100 
acres of available development land nearby is part of plans to develop a Marine Energy 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


50  

Develop the supply chain 


 

3.65 The equipment and construction supply chains for offshore windfarms are still 

at the development stage. Although there are a number of players who are 
making good progress, there is still a lack of capacity and competition overall, 
particularly in the production of key components such as large bearings, 
electrical equipment, export (including HVDC) cables, and the vessels required 
to install them. Investment is also needed in manufacturing sites and port 
infrastructure to facilitate deployment, stimulate the associated supply chain, 
and lowers costs.  


 

3.66 The UK will need to overcome supply chain barriers to lower costs and deploy 
at scale for both 2020 and beyond.   


 

3.67 DECC’s approach is to focus on a small number of key supply constraints 
where Government can have a particular material impact. These include the 
development of manufacturing facilities at port sites, for which DECC will make 
up to £60m of support available by 2015. This money will help leverage large 
private investment to develop the facilities necessary to produce heavy turbine 
components.  


 

3.68 The Scottish Government has also introduced a £70 million National 

Renewables Infrastructure Fund, designed to strengthen port and 
manufacturing facilities and supply chain provision for manufacturing offshore 
wind turbines and related components. The Fund will leverage significant 
private sector investment over the next four years and help deliver an estimated 
28,000 jobs and £7.1 billion in value to Scotland's economy over the coming 
decade. 


 

3.69 DECC is working with the OWDF to support the development of the UK supply 

chain by:- 
o setting a long-term vision for the industry, 
o providing confidence and visibility on future build schedules, 
o learning and implementing relevant lessons from other sectors, such as oil 

and gas, to support cost reduction and supply chain development 


  


Park at Belfast Harbour, focusing on both offshore wind and marine energy technologies.  

DONG Energy, alongside Scottish Power Renewables, have also recently reached 
financial closure on the construction of the 389MW West of Duddon Sands offshore 
windfarm in the Irish Sea and it is expected that the installation and pre-assembly 
operations shall largely be run out of Belfast Harbour. Work will commence in early 2012, 
initially with construction of the required onshore connections. The partners have also 
commissioned two purpose built installation vessels to be used in the construction of the 
project, allowing work to be undertaken in all seasonal conditions. Offshore construction 
for West of Duddon Sands is expected to commence in early summer 2013 with the 
project expected to be fully completed by the end of 2014.

Case study: MTL Group55 

MTL Group is a UK contract manufacturing specialist 
in the metal sector. Founded in 1995 they have 
grown to become a partner of choice for many major 
global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 


 

They have recently been awarded a multimillion 
pound contract to supply 97 Boat Landing Systems 
to a leading European foundations manufacturer for 
a German offshore windfarm in the North Sea. 


  

MTL Group has worked closely with DECC, receiving £250,000 of grant funding to 
‘Develop increased supply of jacket and monopole sub-assemblies’ to increase 
assemblies for the offshore wind sector. With this DECC support MTL Group has 
invested in state of the art machinery that meets the requirements of this growing sector. 


  

The contract which is its largest export 
contract to date, will use all of MTL Group’s 
processing equipment which includes large 
format high definition plasma & laser cutting, 
robotic tube cutting, automated robot 
welding and large CNC machining. 


  

25 MTL employees will be working on the 
project at the groups advanced 
manufacturing facility in Rotherham. Work is 
due to commence  in July 2011 with the final

Government financial support for offshore wind, factors which reduce their 
ability and willingness to secure finance.

3.71 This is a key issue for offshore wind given the scale and cost of projects 
involved and could affect any project which has not yet achieved financial 
close, in particular the 3 GW of capacity currently in the pipeline awaiting 
planning approval or construction (mainly Round 2 projects). Scoping work on 
Round 3 and STW projects could also be affected as well as forthcoming 
projects in the Northern Ireland leasing round, although we do not anticipate 
that these projects will need to achieve financial close imminently.  


 

3.72 Electricity Market Reform will put in place a transparent and long-term financial 

framework for low carbon electricity, including offshore wind.  Government will 
ensure a smooth transition from the RO. As part of this, once the new scheme 
is introduced, new generators will have the choice between the two schemes 
until 2017 and following closure of the RO to new entrants, technology 
payments made under the RO will be grandfathered56. In addition, the 
Government has accelerated the current Banding Review to provide clarity 
sooner on future support levels under the RO – Government will consult in 
summer 2011 and publish its decision the end of the year, one year earlier 
than originally planned.  


 

Actions: 
• DECC will consult on new banding levels in summer 2011 and publish its 

decisions by the end of the year. New banding levels for offshore wind will 
come into force in April 2014 

• DECC will put in place arrangements to ensure a smooth transition from the 
Renewables Obligation to the new electricity market support mechanism. 


 

Access finance 


 

3.73 Deploying offshore wind capacity for 2020 will require investment in the order of 

tens of billions of pounds. Individual Round 3 projects are likely to cost more 
than £1bn and some zones more than £10bn. At present, only the utilities and 
state-backed independent companies are leading the construction phase of 
offshore windfarms. 


 

3.74 There are a limited number of banks willing to consider funding the construction 

phase of offshore wind, partly due to the size of the lending required and the 
difficulty in mitigating construction risk. In addition, banks are constrained in 
their ability to lend to offshore wind projects as there is a limited possibility of 
de-risking their positions over time, whether through the debt syndication 
market or by refinancing in the debt capital market. This constraint will become 
more important over time, as new banking reforms (Basel III) are likely to make 
long-term lending less attractive. 


 

3.75 Moreover, any projects developed by utilities using project finance will typically 

be viewed by rating agencies as on-balance sheet debt for the utility. As a 
result, utilities prefer to fund projects on their own balance sheet, thereby 
avoiding the higher cost, limited availability, and more stringent conditions 

                                            
56 Grandfathering is a policy that support levels should not change once generation has been accredited under 
a scheme, thereby providing investors greater certainty.  




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap

attached to non-recourse project debt funding. But it is unlikely they will be able 
to deliver all of the investment required in this way, given their desire to protect 
credit ratings and make other investments in the UK or overseas. 


 

3.76 These barriers could affect any project which has not yet reached financial 

close, including the 3 GW which is in the pipeline at present but not yet under 
construction. 


 

3.77 Uncertainty about additional risks can also affect the financing of projects, such 

as the perception that the value of an offshore wind investment could be 
diminished because offshore windfarm leases from the Crown Estate can be 
amended or terminated in order to allow an oil or gas development to proceed. 
To reduce this perceived risk, DECC will formalise its existing policy that no 
offshore windfarm lease will be terminated or amended without appropriate 
compensation, and work with the offshore wind and oil & gas industries to set 
out guidance on how to resolve conflicts. 


 

3.78 BIS is setting up the Green Investment Bank (GIB). The GIB’s mission is 
proposed to be providing financial solutions to accelerate private sector 
investment in the UK’s transition to a green economy. In looking to achieve this 
mission the GIB will offer a range of financial products to increase investment in 
low carbon infrastructure. 


 

3.79 Although no decisions have been taken on the sectors and technologies that 

the GIB will focus on, the market failures facing offshore wind are indicative of 
the challenges which the GIB will seek to address. It is therefore likely that 
offshore wind will be a strong candidate for support from the GIB, which could 
play an important role in freeing up utility balance sheets as well as reducing 
project finance costs by helping to place debt in the capital markets and de-
risking project finance.      


 

3.80 In May BIS announced an incubation phase for the GIB from April 2012, under 

which the Government will make direct investment in the green economy 
(taking account of advice from finance professionals) until State Aid approval is 
achieved. Following State Aid approval the GIB will be established as a stand-
alone institution and from April 2015 will be given powers to borrow57. 


 

3.81 DECC is working with developers and investors in the OWDF to identify the 

quantity and type of investment capital required for offshore wind and identify 
whether further Government action is needed and appropriate. To reduce risk 
DECC is clarifying its financial incentives for renewables, as discussed above.  


 

Actions: 
• Government will, from April 2012 and prior to obtaining state aid approval to 

establish the GIB, pursue financial interventions that do not require specific 
approval using the £775m of commitment from 2012/13 made available in the 
Budget.  These are likely to be investments on market terms or under existing 
state aid approvals.   

                                            
57 Subject to public sector net debt falling as a percentage of GDP 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


54 


• Government will aim to achieve state aid clearance as soon as practical in order 
to pass legislation to enshrine the GIBs independence in statute.  

• Government will take action to ensure that no offshore windfarm lease will be 
terminated or amended without appropriate compensation to allow oil and gas 
development to proceed, and will work with industry to set out more detailed 
guidance before the end of 2011. 


 

Ensure cost-effective grid investment and connection  


 

3.82 To deliver the increase in offshore wind generation expected by 2020, the UK 

will need significant and timely investment in the grid, both to bring electricity 
ashore and to strengthen the onshore transmission network. The Crown Estate 
estimate, for example, that around £10bn of investment will be required to 
connect all Round 3 projects to shore.58 Investment will need to be well 
coordinated to ensure it is deliverable and cost-effective.  


 

Box 5: Offshore Transmission Operation (OFTO) 


 

The competitive approach to granting offshore transmission licences is expected to have 
a number of advantages including encouraging innovation and new entrants. Connections 
for nine offshore projects (with 2 GW of capacity and connections worth £1.1bn) were 
tendered by Ofgem in the first OFTO tender round. Ofgem has forecast savings of £350m 
from these nine grid connection projects compared to onshore grid costs59. 

The first tender round has shown strong evidence of investment appetite and new 
sources of finance, attracting almost £4bn of investment for £1.1bn of assets. Preferred 
bidders have been announced for the transmission assets of eight of the nine offshore 
windfarms in this round: 

• Transmission Capital Partners (a consortium of Transmission Capital, Amber 
Infrastructure and International Public Partnerships) is the preferred bidder for Barrow, 
Gunfleet Sands, and Ormonde.  

• Balfour Beatty Capital Ltd is the preferred bidder for Thanet.  

• A consortium of Balfour Beatty Capital Ltd, Equitix Ltd and AMP Capital Investors Ltd 
is the preferred bidder for Greater Gabbard.  

• Macquarie Capital Group as part of a consortium including Barclays Private Equity and 
NIBC Infrastructure Partners is preferred bidder for Sheringham Shoal, Walney I and 
Walney II. 

The first OFTO licence was granted in April 2011, to Transmission Capital Partners, for 
the Robin Rigg offshore windfarm. 

The second tender round has been launched for projects with a capacity of 2.8 GW and 
an estimated connection asset value of £1.9 billion. Ofgem recently announced a 
shortlist of four bidders competing to own and operate transmission links (with 1.4 GW of 
capacity) for three offshore windfarms. Preferred bidders will be announced in Autumn 
2011.

3.83 To facilitate investment, DECC commenced the new offshore transmission 
regulatory regime in July 2010 for certain offshore transmission projects from 
the point of transfer of constructed transmission assets from the generator to 
the Offshore Transmission Owner (OFTO), appointed by virtue of a tender 
exercise run by Ofgem. In response to feedback from developers, codes and 
licences were amended in December 2010 to extend the generator-build option 
for the future alongside the OFTO build option.   


 

3.84 To improve investment planning, DECC and Ofgem set up the Offshore 

Transmission Coordination Project in March 2011, leveraging industry 
involvement to examine whether any further changes are needed to the 
offshore transmission regime to ensure coordinated development of Round 3 
offshore transmission assets. The project will report at the end of 2011, 
followed by a consultation in 2012 if further measures are considered 
necessary. 


 

3.85 To manage the costs of connection, National Grid have extended the interim 

financial security arrangement until April 2012, whereby developers are only 
required to provide security for local connections rather than wider 
reinforcement. To help inform National Grid’s analysis to identify suitable long 
term arrangements, DECC is consulting with the OWDF and the marine energy 
industry. National Grid intends to publish a consultation later this year with the 
aim of implementing any changes by April 2012.   


 

Box 6: The ISLES Project 


 

The ISLES project is a collaboration between the Scottish Government, the Northern 
Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland to drive forward the delivery of grid 
infrastructure for 2020 and beyond and connecting up markets. 


 

The project, funded by the European Union’s INTERREG IVA Programme, is assessing 
the feasibility of creating an offshore interconnected transmission network and subsea 
electricity grid to garner and transport electricity created from renewable energy sources 
in the northern coastal waters linking Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland and in the 
Irish Sea. The results of ISLES first major initiative will have been disseminated to 
stakeholders by the end of 2011. 


 

3.86 The Northern Ireland Executive is working closely with stakeholders to ensure 

that there is significant and timely investment in the grid to facilitate offshore 
technologies.  Northern Ireland is currently developing an Onshore Renewable 
Strategic Action Plan which will also examine the impact of bringing electricity 
ashore and its associated impact on Northern Ireland’s onshore transmission 
network. 


 

Actions: 
• DECC and Ofgem will publish the conclusions of the Offshore Transmission 

Coordination Project by the end of the year, followed by a consultation in 2012 
if further measures are considered necessary. 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


56 


• Several of the actions described in onshore wind regarding the transmission 
network (see section beginning paragraph 3.39 above) are also relevant to 
offshore wind. 


 

Planning and consenting 

3.87 New National Policy Statements clarify the national need for new energy 
infrastructure, including for offshore wind, and how the impacts of development 
should be mitigated to safeguard sustainability. 


 

3.88 Offshore wind projects can face delay in securing consent, while potential 
impacts on the marine environment and other users of the sea are considered 
and resolved. In some cases, there may be specific site-related issues, leading 
to loss of the project, whilst in others it will take time to measure, resolve, and 
mitigate impacts. Early engagement between developers and the appropriate 
statutory consultees as part of the reformed approach to marine licensing, as 
well as in the implementation of the new marine planning system should avoid 
some delays, which are costly for developers and delay their revenues from 
generation.  


 

3.89 Failing to resolve these tensions could, in theory, impact the 1.9 GW of new 

capacity currently in planning and the additional capacity we anticipate will 
come forward through the decade. Round 3 projects, in particular, will be larger 
in size and more complex than Rounds 1 and 2, suggesting greater potential 
cumulative impacts on marine ecology in particular as projects grow in number 
and greater demands on the statutory advisors and regulators who assess 
applications. 


 

3.90 To clarify the impact of environmental legislation on offshore wind, DECC is 
working60 to understand, and where appropriate manage, the implications of 
Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) and the Marine Strategy Framework 
Directive (MSFD). DEFRA will consult on proposed MCZ boundaries in summer 
2012. In accordance with the MSFD, the UK’s determination of Good 
Environmental Status, and associated targets and indicators, has to be 
submitted to the EU Commission by July 2012. The Welsh Government will be 
responsible for designating Marine Conservation Zones in Wales.  


 

3.91 To build the evidence base and fill gaps which can hamper the planning 

process, DECC is undertaking research on the likely impacts of offshore wind 
on the environment and other sea users through its rolling programme of 
Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs). The post-consultation report for 
the Offshore SEA 2 will be published in summer 2011.  


 

3.92 To tackle the issues and resource constraints that consenting and regulatory 

bodies face in response to an increasing volume of applications, the Marine 
Management Organisation (MMO) has established an Offshore Renewable 
Energy Licensing Group. This will look at strategic issues such data gaps,

cumulative impact and the survey methods used. The group includes all bodies 
involved in the licensing and consenting of marine renewable energy and met 
for the first time in June 2011. 


 

Actions: 
• DECC is working to understand the implications of MCZs on offshore projects. 

DEFRA will consult on MCZ zones in summer 2012, with designations by 
December 2012. The Welsh Government will be consulting separately in 2012. 

• DECC will publish a post-consultation report in summer 2011 identifying gaps in 
its evidence base for Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessments. 

• MMO has established an offshore regulators group, which met for the first time 
in June 2011 to tackle the challenges that regulatory bodies face and manage 
consenting delays.  

• Northern Ireland will publish its final Offshore Renewable Energy Strategic 
Action Plan by December 2011.

• Wave and tidal stream technologies are still at an early stage of development with 
around 4 MW of prototypes currently undergoing testing in the UK.  

• Commercial deployment of wave and tidal stream has yet to begin but the central 
range suggests up to 300 MW (approximately 0.9 TWh) could be deployed in the 
UK by 2020. Much larger scale deployment is anticipated in the period beyond 
2020. 

• While tidal range technologies are largely proven, they need to be deployed through 
commercial-scale construction projects to be successful. Developers are currently 
evaluating a number of specific projects but these are unlikely to be operational and 
making a significant contribution before 2020 given the high costs and lead times for 
construction.  

• Challenges to deployment include: managing the risks and costs of RD&D; securing  
the investment required for commercial deployment; developing supply chain 
infrastructure, securing consents.   


 

Priority actions: 
• Manage the risks and costs of RD&D: Deliver a co-ordinated, targeted programme 

of marine innovation support over the next four years, including up to £20m of 
support from DECC for pre-commercial array demonstration. Establishment of an 
offshore renewables Technology and Innovation Centre, and new programmes to 
support R&D that will reduce the cost of marine energy. Scottish Government will 
announce details of their joint funding programme by the end of 2011. 

• Secure the investment for commercial deployment: Work through the UK Marine 
Energy Programme to assist the sector in obtaining investment funding. Work with 
the Crown Estate to create a knowledge sharing network to support development.  

• Development supply chain infrastructure: Work with the sector to develop Marine 
Energy Parks through the publication of guidance by March 2012.  

• Planning and consenting


 

: Finalise outcome of the Strategic Environmental 
Assessment (SEA) consultation and input to policy on use of the sea. Work with 
marine regulators to better understand and overcomes key barriers to planning and 
consenting process for marine renewables. 

Current deployment  
3.93 Wave and tidal stream technologies are still at a relatively early stage of 

development. There is currently one operational 1.2MW tidal stream turbine in 
Strangford Narrows in Northern Ireland. In addition, a number of tidal stream 
and wave energy devices, ranging up to 1MW, have been deployed at the 
European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney for testing. There are no 
tidal range schemes in the UK at present.

Deployment potential 
3.94 Figure 17 presents the results of recent analysis of the potential growth of wave 

and tidal stream generation to 2020. It overlays an industry view of the 
deployment that could be achieved (the ‘industry high’ and ‘industry low’ 
scenarios) around a central range.   

Case study: UK Marine Energy Testing Infrastructure 

The UK has long been viewed as a 
focus for activity for the development 
of wave and tidal energy 
technologies, with the majority of 
leading developers based here and 
planning to deploy commercially in UK 
waters. This has been underpinned by 
the UK Government’s investment to 
create a unique testing and innovation 
infrastructure. 

The European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in the Orkneys was created through a 
mixture public sector funding in 2003 when the wave testing site was opened, followed by 
a tidal testing site in 2007. The Centre provides grid connected berths for testing both 
large scale wave and tidal energy devices. All bar one of the full scale prototypes funded 
under DECC’s Marine Renewable Proving Fund will be deployed at EMEC. DECC has 
recently funded an £8m expansion of the EMEC test site with the installation of three 
additional grid connected cables (2 tidal,1 wave) and the creation of a “nursery” testing 
site which will allow developers to test part-scale wave and tidal devices in more benign 
marine conditions or to practice deployment and maintenance operations prior to 
operating at the main testing sites. The “nursery” site has also already been attracting 
interest from other sectors which would benefit from testing components and structures in 
the marine environment (providing a potential revenue source between marine energy 
tests).   

The Wave Hub wave array testing facility was deployed off the coast of Cornwall in 2010 
and will provide facilities to demonstrate small arrays of wave energy devices, up to a total 
of 20MW. The first devices, produced by Ocean Power Technologies are due to be 

deployed at Wave Hub next year.  

Alongside the facilities at EMEC and 
Wave Hub the Government has also 
funded an onshore tidal drive train testing 
facility at the National Renewable Energy 
CentreS in the North East  of England. 
This will be completed next year and 
allow the onshore testing of tidal devices 
prior to deployment, reducing costs of  
development and leading to enhanced 
reliability.

3.95 In the central range pre-commercial wave and tidal stream array 
demonstrations will be carried out between 2013 and 2015, with commercial 
deployment increasing through the second half of the decade. The Welsh 
Government believe that by 2025 up to 4 GW of marine energy could be 
installed and operating around its coast. A range of studies have suggested 
that given continued development of the sector, wave and tidal energy could 
expand through the 2020s to achieve some 27 GW61 by 2050.   


 

3.96 The central range does not assume a contribution from tidal range by 2020 

given the long lead times of these projects. However, although the UK and 
Welsh Governments’ Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study did not see a 
strategic case for public investment at the present time, developers are 
currently assessing a number of potential future projects in the Severn area and 
elsewhere (e.g. the Mersey and Solway Firth).  


 

3.97 Analysis62 suggests considerable variation in the levelised cost of marine 

technologies, ranging from £162 to £340MWh in 202063. This reflects cost 
differences between the individual technologies considered, uncertainty about 
anticipated levels of learning, global deployment, and technology risk. Capital 
costs are expected to fall as projects move from prototype stage to commercial 
deployment, but the scale of the decrease is hard to predict and depends, for 
example, on the intensity of the marine resource exploited.

Deployment pipeline 


 

3.98 At present there is no firm planning pipeline for wave and tidal stream. 

Progress has been made in pre-commercial deployment in recent years, with 
several large scale prototypes now in testing and active plans from the 
industry to deploy small arrays in the next four years.  


 

3.99 In preparation for this wider deployment, several Strategic Environmental 

Assessments (SEAs) have been recently produced or are under development 
across the UK. The Offshore Energy SEA for English and Welsh waters 
should be completed this summer and will complement the existing SEAs for 
Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the SEAs prepared for the Severn Estuary. 
This should open up the whole of the UK waters for the potential deployment 
of marine energy devices.    


 

3.100 Following the SEA of Scottish waters, the Crown Estate awarded commercial 
leases in the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters for 1.6 GW of marine 
generation, the first of its kind anywhere in the world. Further leasing rounds 
for other parts of Scotland have since been set in motion, a Marine Energy 
Infrastructure Study will be undertaken shortly within Welsh waters to identify 
waters suitable for the deployment of prototype to commercial scale devices, 
and The Crown Estate recently launched a discussion process with the 
renewable energy industry on the design and development of offshore wind 
and tidal energy in Northern Ireland.   

Journey to deployment for wave and tidal stream 
3.101 The technology development map set out below in Figure 18 outlines the way 

in which wave and tidal stream technologies progress from concept through 
prototypes and commercial trials to full-scale deployment. The map shows the 
next critical stage in deployment is the pre-commercial demonstration of small 
scale arrays of devices, which we anticipate will be over the next four years. 
This will require, in particular, further support for  innovation, securing the 
investment funding for commercial demonstration, development of the supply 
chain and securing the planning and consenting required for these 
demonstrations.

Challenges to deployment and actions 
3.102 Our analysis of deployment and discussions with industry suggest that there 

are at least four main challenges to the deployment of marine technologies in 
the UK. DECC have established a UK Marine Energy Programme to address 
these key challenges, bringing together Government across the UK and the 
private sector to accelerate development of the marine renewables sector.  


 

Manage the risks and costs of RD&D  


 

3.103 Demonstration projects are a crucial step towards commercial deployment but 

are viewed as high risk due to their uncertain success rates and considerable 
cost64. In addition, where demonstration projects are successful, further 
innovation will often be required, so that the reliability, performance and 
durability of devices can be improved, before companies can move to 
commercial deployment. 


 

3.104 To underpin innovation, the Government has provided support to the UK’s 

marine testing facilities at the NaREC, the European Marine Energy Centre 

                                            
64 A survey carried out for RenewableUK (Wave and Tidal Energy in the UK: State of the industry report, 
March 2011) suggested capital costs of £42m-£84m for the first 10MW wave and tidal energy projects.

(EMEC), and the Wave Hub. In particular, DECC has recently funded an £8m 
expansion of EMEC (which included the provision of three more wave and 
tidal testing berths and the creation of a ‘nursery’ testing site) and will work 
with BIS to facilitate commissioning the ‘Nautilus’ drive testing facility at 
NaREC. The Welsh Government has also allocated over £20 million to marine 
research and development.   


 

3.105 To facilitate demonstration projects, DECC will set-aside up to £20m of its 

innovation budget over the next 4 years to support innovation in marine 
energy technologies, subject to value for money assessments. This will 
support the demonstration of up to 2 tidal and wave arrays. In addition to this, 
there may be an opportunity for funding from the EU New Entrants’ Reserve 
Fund 300 (NER300). DECC recently submitted one wave and three tidal 
stream array projects to the European Commission for consideration.  


 

3.106 DECC funded schemes will be part of a coordinated programme of support 

provided by the members of the Government’s Low Carbon Innovation 
Group65 and the Devolved Administrations. Details of a number of schemes 
are being developed and will complement existing commitments which 
include: 
o Energy Technologies Institute: has a marine programme which focuses on 

reliability and cost reduction through design and testing of prototypes under 
relevant conditions.   

o Technology Strategy Board (TSB): ongoing marine projects supporting cost 
reduction  and improve performance through innovation.  Announcement in 
May 2011 to start the competition to form an Offshore Renewable Energy 
Technology Innovation Centre.  

o Research Councils: continue with the Marine Supergen programme with its 
aim being to increase knowledge and understanding of device-sea 
interactions of energy converters from model-scale in the laboratory to full 
size in the open sea. 

o Capital and revenue funding via EU convergence fund monies, 
administered by the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO). The Welsh 
Government is engaged with WEFO and the EU Commission to consider a 
structural fund programme post 2013 and how it might support the sector. 


 

Actions: 
• DECC will provide up to £20m of its innovation budget over the next 4 years, 

subject to value-for –money assessment, to support demonstration of marine 
energy technologies. The application process is expected to be launched in

Secure the investment for commercial deployment  


 

3.107 Many of the companies developing marine energy technologies in the UK are 
relatively small, start-up businesses with limited financial resources. As a 
result industry evidence suggests they often struggle to secure the significant 
levels of up-front investment and working capital needed to move projects 
from demonstration to large scale commercial deployment. Access to finance 
has been further affected, the industry indicate, by perceived uncertainty 
about the long term level of Government revenue  support available for marine 
energy. This is currently provided through the Renewables Obligation (RO) 
which varies from 2 ROCs/MWh in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for 
wave and tidal energy to 3 ROCs/MWh in Scotland for tidal stream and 5 
ROCs/MWh for wave. Northern Ireland has recently consulted on support 
levels for marine power.  


 

3.108 Although Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and utilities may choose 

to invest once technologies and devices are proven at prototype scale, action 
is needed to improve access to finance in the more immediate term. Some 
utilities have already made a substantial investment in the development of 
wave and tidal projects, whilst OEM’s are gradually increasing their interest 
and some are starting to take a significant position in the wave and tidal 
sector. 


 

3.109 To provide clarity on financial incentives, the Government has a Banding 

Review in place to consider the levels of support provided under the RO for all 
renewable electricity technologies, including marine. The Government will now 
consult in Summer 2011 and publish its decision by the end of the year, one 
year earlier than originally planned. DECC is working with the Finance 
Working Group of the UK Marine Energy Programme to feed evidence from 
the sector into this Banding Review.  


 

3.110 Given the timing of large scale marine energy deployment, the support 

mechanisms in the Electricity Market Reform White Paper published 
alongside this Roadmap are likely to be more relevant to the technology than 
the RO scheme as this will provide the long-term signals the sector requires. 


 

3.111 To reduce deployment costs for marine energy projects and unlock 

investment, DECC and The Crown Estate are developing a sector-wide 
knowledge sharing network, including an open access database which will be 
ready by the end of 2011. It will look to work alongside the development of the 
Marine Energy Parks and the Offshore Renewables Technology Innovation 
Centre, and will help to increase the level of information exchange in order to 
accelerate the level of marine energy deployment. 


 

Actions:  
• DECC is reviewing the levels of support available under the RO, including for  

marine energy, and will publish its decisions in Autumn 2011. 
• DECC and The Crown Estate are developing a sector wide knowledge 

network, and detailed plans for this will be presented to the Marine Energy 
Programme Board by the end of 2011 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


65 


Develop supply chain infrastructure 


 

3.112 Potential manufacturers need a degree of certainty about which of the 
currently unproven marine technologies will be deployable by 2020 before 
they can commit to entering the market and ramping up supply. Inherent 
uncertainty about technology development has constrained the development 
of the supply chain to date.  


 

3.113 DECC is working with the sector to ensure that adequate supply capacity is in 

place to support commercial deployment later in the decade. For example, we 
are helping to develop Marine Energy Parks, which aim to accelerate 
deployment by encouraging a favourable business environment for marine 
energy. By clustering key manufacturing and related activities and personnel, 
it will help to ensure that network benefits and economies of scale are 
realised.  


 

3.114 Where possible the Government’s work will build on the considerable 

expertise already available in the UK maritime, offshore wind and technology 
sectors, and on similar work which is underway to stimulate the supply chain 
for offshore wind. 


 

Actions: 
• DECC will publish guidance by March 2012 for organisations developing 

sustainable Marine Energy Parks on a regional basis which will support the 
growth of the sector.  


 

Planning and consenting 


 

3.115 Developers have expressed concern that the measures to protect the marine 

environment could place a financial burden on them and unduly limit the level 
of offshore resource available for development. They indicate that  
deployment could be particularly affected by the designation of a network of 
Marine Conservation Zones under the Marine  and Coastal Access Act 2009 
and possible limits on underwater noise levels under the Marine Strategy 
Framework Directive.  


 

3.116 Government is working to ensure that policy balances effectively its twin 

priorities to exploit the UK’s natural resource in offshore renewable energy 
and to protect the marine environment from unacceptable damage and for 
other users. Planning reform, including the introduction of the marine planning 
and consent regime, is intended to enable sustainable development and 
provide greater certainty through a clear and simplified regulatory framework. 


 

3.117 To support the evidence base for policy making, the UK Offshore Energy 

SEA 2 for wave and tidal energy in English and Welsh waters was published 
for consultation in February 2011. This sets out the likely impacts of offshore 
deployment on sea users and the environment. DECC will publish its 
response on wave and tidal elements of the document by the end of the year. 


 


UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


66 


3.118 The Welsh Government has published a Marine Renewable Energy Strategic 
Framework identifying the exploitable resource by device type and mapping 
development constraints. The Welsh Government has recently given 
development consent to a 1.2MW tidal device demonstration in Ramsay 
Sound. The “deploy and monitor” approach under which this device will be 
deployed will increase understanding of the impacts of such devices on the 
marine environment. Welsh Government will shortly start work on its Marine 
Energy Infrastructure Study to identify specific sites for deployment, and the 
Northern Ireland Executive will publish Regional Locational Guidance over the 
summer. 


 

3.119 As part of the UK Marine Energy Programme, DECC is working with the 

Marine Management Organisation and Marine Scotland to establish a working 
group to consider the approach to  planning and consenting  for marine  
renewable energy. In addition, to help inform work on the designation of 
appropriate Marine Conservation Zones, DECC undertook research in 2011 
on the implications of the proposed Zones on offshore energy deployment.  


 

Actions: 
• DECC will publish its response to feedback on wave and tidal energy 

elements of the second SEA for Offshore Energy by the end of 2011.  
• Welsh Government will identify specific sites for marine energy deployment 

through the development of a Marine Energy Infrastructure study. 
• Northern Ireland Executive will publish Regional Local Guidance on the 

deployment of marine power in September 2011.   
• DECC will set up a working group under the Marine Energy Programme Board 

in coordination with the MMO, Welsh Government, and Marine Scotland to 
consider how to address barriers to planning and consenting process for 
marine renewables. The group will report to the Programme Board by the end 
of 2011   


   


UK Renewable Energy Roadmap

Biomass Electricity  

• Biomass electricity is a predictable and non-intermittent technology. In 2010 the UK 
had 2.5 GW66 of capacity in operation (generating approximately 11.9 TWh)67.  

• The central range for deployment indicates that biomass electricity could contribute up 
to 6 GW by 202068. Achieving this level of capacity equates to an annual growth rate of 
9%. The breadth of the central range reflects uncertainty about the availability of 
sustainable biomass for electricity given competing demands from heat, transport and 
non-energy sectors. 

• Conversion of coal plant to biomass is a major new development. In addition to this 
and co-firing, the existing pipeline contains an additional 4.2 GW, taking into account 
historic planning approval rates69. When taken together with existing operational 
capacity this could deliver the central range for 2020 if projects are brought through 
the pipeline in a timely manner. There is also scope for new projects to enter the 
pipeline. 

• Challenges to deployment include: minimising investment risk and de-risking the 
supply of sustainable feedstocks, planning and consenting, and regulatory framework. 
Advanced conversion technologies may, in addition, struggle to secure finance if they 
are viewed as commercially untested.  


 

  Priority actions: 
• Minimise investment risk: Accelerate RO banding review and implement proposed 

Electricity Market Reform to improve revenue certainty for projects. Publish a UK 
Bioenergy Strategy later this year articulating a clear vision for the growth of sustainable 
biomass energy in the UK. 

• De-risking the supply chain of sustainable feedstocks: Align incentives to feedstock 
availability and from 2013 make payment of incentives dependent on meeting these.  
Make available for public use by the end of the year a Greenhouse Gas Lifecycle 
Assessment Tool for biomass heat and electricity generation.  

• Planning and consenting: Work with Defra, the Welsh Government, the Environment 
Agency and stakeholders to ensure that environmental legislation does not have an 
unintended impact on the development of renewable energy plant, including energy 
from waste. Government will work with industry to develop cost effective fuel monitoring 
and sampling to accurately measure renewable content of waste. Planning reform in 
England and Wales is set out in the onshore wind section above. 

• Access long-term waste fuel contracts: Expand supply chains for waste wood and 
solid recovered fuel and provide improved information on available waste. Consult on  
measures to divert waste from landfill including possible landfill restrictions for waste 
wood. 

• Access to finance: Government has provided support for Advanced Conversion 
Technology demonstration projects and has created the Green Investment Bank which 
could play a role in supporting these technologies. DECC will announce details of 
potential funding to support innovation, in areas such as the advanced conversion of 
waste, subject to value for money assessments and conclusion of innovation needs 
work.

Current deployment 
3.120 At the end of 2010 there was 2.5 GW of biomass electricity capacity operating 

in the UK, accounting for 11.9 TWh of generation. This is the single largest 
contribution to UK’s total renewable electricity generation.  


 

3.121 The majority of generation comes from waste (62% – predominantly landfill 

gas), although co-firing and dedicated biomass plant are also significant (21% 
and 17%). Anaerobic Digestion (AD) and other advanced conversion 
technologies are less well established, particularly at scale. Biomass 
electricity is more prevalent in England and Wales than in other parts of the 
United Kingdom, although Northern Ireland is also seeing a steady increase. 
Box 7 provides background information on the key fuels types and conversion 
technologies available for biomass electricity.  


  

Deployment potential 
3.122 Figure 19 sets out the results of analysis70 of the potential for growth in 

biomass electricity generation to 2020. The breadth of the central range 
reflects the dynamic potential of the large-scale biomass sector and the key 
issue of whether the global supply of sustainable feedstocks can fuel it, given 
that supplies are finite and there are competing uses in the bio-economy. The 

                                            
70 These figures include electricity generation from CHP technology. 

Box 7: Biomass electricity – characteristics, fuel types and conversion 
technologies 


 

The term biomass refers to both virgin material, such as wood residues, agricultural 
crops and farming residues, and the biogenic fraction of waste material, such as 
municipal solid waste, other biodegradable waste including food and landfill and 
sewage gas.  


 

Biomass can be used in a wide range of conversion technologies, including (for dry 
material) dedicated combustion, co-firing with fossil fuels, and waste combustion, and 
(for wet material) anaerobic digestion to produce a flammable biogas. All of these 
technologies can be used to produce heat and electricity together in a combined heat 
and power (CHP) plant, where heat is recovered from the electricity generation process 
and put to further use. A number of advanced technologies are also under 
development, including gasification and pyrolysis.  


 

Dedicated plant are typically built from scratch (new build), although it is also possible 
to convert existing fossil fuel power stations to run on 100% solid biomass (conversion) 
and a number of such projects are under consideration by developers. Co-firing is 
usually possible within existing plant subject to technical limits on the proportion of 
biomass used.  

Biomass electricity has the advantage that it is both predictable and controllable and so 
can be used for baseload or peakload generation. Energy from waste has the added 
advantages that it extracts value from  biomass at the end of its useful life and reduces 
the amount of waste otherwise sent to landfill and thus reduces methane emissions. 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


69 


low and high scenarios reflect initial views from industry on the upside 
potential and downside risks.  


 

3.123 The analysis indicates that under the central range the market has the 
potential to deploy up to 6 GW71 of biomass electricity by 2020 (equivalent to 
around 50 TWh). Achieving this 3.5 GW increase will require an annual 
growth rate of 9% for the next decade. We anticipate that the majority of this 
growth will be met from conversion of coal plant, dedicated biomass 
generation, biomass waste combustion and anaerobic digestion. Landfill and 
sewage gas – which are significant in the baseline – have already been 
largely exploited. The upper end of the central range has a peak in 2011-2013 
reflecting the short-term conversion of specific plants to biomass usage during 
this period.  


 

Figure 19: Deployment potential to 2020 for biomass electricity 


 

3.124 Biomass electricity has significant upside potential and could feasibly exceed 
the industry high, helping to meet the 15% target cost effectively. However, 
the projections can only be achieved if sufficient sustainable feedstocks are 
available. The industry high scenario assumes that build rates and 
sustainably-sourced feedstock supply are not limiting and that the capacity 
currently in the pipeline is not subject to delays. The industry low scenario 
assumes that landfill and sewage gas will not increase whilst waste is 
deployed at a low build rate. It also assumes that there are constraints to the 
deployment of dedicated biomass plants, meaning that growth in new build is 
delayed until 2016.   


 

3.125 Analysis for DECC72 suggests wide ranges for levelised cost of biomass 

electricity – £70-£173/MWh in 2020, down only slightly from £75-£194/MW in 

                                            
71 Without taking into account the potential for increased co-firing.

2010. Ranges are wide due to the large number of individual technologies 
considered73 (co-firing is generally least expensive, followed by conversion, 
and then dedicated biomass), uncertainty about AD, and the wide of range of 
project-specific factors affecting plant (fuel type, scale, the proportion of 
biomass used). Cost reductions are small due to minimal learning rates 
assumed for the relatively mature combustion technologies, although AD is 
projected to benefit from falling hurdle rates as the technology is 
demonstrated to work. There is significant innovation and cost reduction 
potential for bioenergy more widely, using technologies such as gasification 
and pyrolysis, as well as agri-innovation to increase feedstock yields. 


 

Case study:  Dalkia Biomass Plant   

Dalkia’s £40million Biomass Plant  at 
Chilton near Durham is expected to begin 
generation in July. The 18MW new plant 
has been designed to be fuelled on locally 
sourced waste wood and, when completed, 
the plant will generate renewable electricity 
and heat.   

The plant can generate sufficient electricity 
for around 20,000 homes and there is an 
opportunity to provide renewable heat via 
district heat networks.  

The Chilton plant will process waste wood on site and use around 120,000 tonnes of 
wood biomass thus removing this from the waste stream and reducing the landfill burden. 
Dalkia estimate that the plant will also provide around 50 new local jobs during the 
construction phase, a further 17 jobs on the site and additional jobs in the supporting 
infrastructure for the site. 


 

Deployment pipeline  
3.126 Figure 20 illustrates that the existing pipeline – excluding conversion and 

increased co-firing74 – contains 4.2 GW of capacity taking into account historic 
planning approval rates75. Taken with what is currently operational, this could 
deliver the central range for 2020 if projects are brought through the pipeline 
in a timely manner. 


 

3.127 The majority of the existing pipeline is from large scale dedicated plant         

(3.3 GW), with Energy from Waste (EfW) projects accounting for a smaller 

                                            
73 This range includes dedicated biomass, biomass co-firing, biomass conversion and AD of less than 5 MW. It 
does not include bioliquids, landfill and sewage gas or the combustion of municipal solid waste.

proportion (0.9 GW). Of the applications awaiting consent, 78% are under 
50MW and will be decided at local level.  


 

Figure 20: Capacity of biomass electricity projects in the planning pipeline76  


 

3.128 Figure 20 does not account for the possibility that generators will convert 
existing plant to biomass or make greater use of co-firing. These options offer 
considerable scope for additional generation, which we are quantifying in the 
RO Banding Review.  


 

Journey to deployment 
3.129 Figure 21 presents a ‘developer journey map’ for new-build dedicated 

biomass plant. The map outlines the key stages of the deployment process 
and the parties who contribute. Key challenges are highlighted in red. From 
scoping to operation, the process can take in the order of 5-8 years depending 
on the complexity of any planning conditions and the need to secure an 
Engineering Procurement Contract (EPC) in order to obtain finance.  


    

                                            
76 Based on historic consenting rates, the capacity shown in green could potentially be lost from the pipeline 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


72 


Figure 21: Developer journey map for new-build, dedicated biomass 
electricity projects


 

3.130 To shorten this process, increase build rates, and bring forward capacity in the 
pipeline, we must tackle constraints at each stage. Some of these challenges 
differ according to the type of fuel and conversion technology used, so we 
have outlined actions separately for waste and dedicated biomass plant. 


 

Challenges to deployment and actions 
Generation from non-waste fuels 

3.131 Our analysis of deployment statistics and discussions with industry suggest 
that developers must overcome at least two main challenges to deploy 
dedicated and co-firing plant in the UK: 


 

Minimise investment risk  


 

3.132 Historically, investor confidence in large scale biomass electricity projects has 

been limited by the lack of completed projects which can be held up to 
potential investors as evidence that similar projects have been successful. 
Consequently, the financial sector has been cautious, looking to offset risk 
through EPCs and long term feedstock contracts. 


 

3.133 Confidence has been further weakened by perceived uncertainty about 

Government policy, including the level and surety of long term financial 
support. In particular, developers have found it difficult to obtain project 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


73 


finance for plant which, given the relatively long lead times for biomass 
electricity projects, may not be operational before new Renewables Obligation 
(RO) banding levels come into force.  


 

3.134 Our work with industry suggests that these uncertainties could impact the       

4 GW of projects in the pipeline but not in construction. DECC is taking 
various actions to improve investor confidence. 


 

3.135 In 2010 the Government “grandfathered”77 the level of support available for 

most dedicated-feedstock and energy from waste plant under the RO from the 
point of full accreditation, subject to the 2037 end date of the scheme. In 
addition, it accelerated the timetable for the 2013 Banding Review to provide 
clarity by the end of the year, one year earlier than previously planned about 
future support levels for new projects. The Review will address the issue of 
grandfathering remaining biomass technologies.  


 

3.136 Electricity Market Reform is designed to improve the market’s ability to finance 

the huge investment in low carbon electricity that is needed over the next 
decade and beyond. In implementing this change, the Government is aware of 
the need to ensure a smooth transition from the Renewables Obligation.  


 

3.137 In addition, the Government is developing a Bioenergy Strategy for publication 

by the end of the year. This will provide clarity on our ambition for biomass 
electricity in the context of the other uses for biomass, including non-energy 
uses. It will set out an expectation of sustainable biomass from domestic 
sources and imports, taking into account all available evidence on the full life 
cycle carbon impact of biomass, including Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC) 
effects. The Scottish Government is committed to ensure impacts on existing 
biomass users are mitigated as demand continues to grow, including a 
forthcoming review of support for large-scale electricity-only biomass under 
the Renewables Obligation Scotland. 


 

Actions: 
• DECC will consult on banding levels for biomass electricity, including co-firing 

and conversion of fossil plant, in summer 2011, in order to publish finalised 
levels by the end of the year.  

• DECC is  publishing its EMR White Paper alongside this document, setting 
out details of the new support mechanism and the transition from the RO. 

• The Government will publish its UK Bioenergy Strategy by the end of the year.  


  

De-risk the supply of sustainable feedstocks  


 

3.138 Dedicated biomass electricity offers great potential for cost effective 
renewable electricity generation, provided that it is generated from sustainable 
feedstocks. As noted above, the Government’s ambition for biomass 
electricity depends on the availability of suitable feedstocks. The Government 
considers that sustainable biomass should be cultivated, processed and 

                                            
77 Grandfathering is a policy that support levels should not change once generation has been accredited under 
a scheme, thereby providing investors greater certainty. 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


74 


transported in a way which delivers real and significant greenhouse gas 
savings compared to the fossil fuel it is replacing. In particular, forest and 
woodlands must be sustainably managed to ensure continuing supplies in 
future years. There would also be significant public concern to projects 
delivering unsustainable generation. 


 

3.139 To safeguard sustainability, the Government has ensured that from April 2011 
RO support is only available for bioliquids that deliver at least 35% 
greenhouse gas savings and do not use materials sourced from land 
important on carbon or biodiversity grounds, such as primary forest, peatland 
and wetland78. For solid and gaseous fuels we have introduced standards 
based on a 60% reduction in GHG. Generators are required to report against 
criteria for solid and gaseous fuels from April 2011, in preparation for a 
requirement to meet them from April 2013 in order to receive RO support79. 


 

3.140 At present, RO sustainability standards do not take into account the possible 
carbon impacts generated by ILUC. The European Commission is expected to 
come forward with proposals in July 2011 for sustainability standards on the 
indirect emissions from bioliquids, which the UK will consider as a matter of 
priority.  


 

3.141 The supply chain for biomass feedstocks is currently too immature and must 

expand to support the level of biomass electricity generation we envisage 
given competing uses for the fuel. There is potentially a huge global capacity  
if properly exploited, with possibly 10% of the net international market 
available to the UK80. The introduction of sustainability standards will facilitate 
the rapid development of the supply chains.  


 

Actions: 
• To safeguard sustainability, DECC will under the RO, introduce mandatory 

sustainability standards for all solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels used for 
electricity generation in the UK by April 2013.   

• To improve the consideration of planning applications, DECC will make a 
‘GHG lifecycle assessment tool for biomass heat and electricity generation’ 
available for public use by December 2011, and will develop a 
communications plan with industry and NGOs on opportunities and risks 
associated with the technology. 


     

                                            
78 There are exceptions, including for wastes. 
79 There is a de minimis threshold of 1MW for the requirement to meet the standards for solid and gaseous 
fuels.

Case study:  Tilbury Power Station 

Tilbury Power Station in Essex began full operation as a coal-fired power station in 1969.  
The plant burnt its last coal in May 2011 and is expected to be fully operational as a 
biomass plant by the end of 2011, continuing until closure due to Large Combustion 
Plants Directive opt-out by 2015 at the latest. 

Once conversion is complete, Tilbury is expected to have a capacity of around 750MW, 
and will use approximately 2m tonnes of sustainable biomass over its operational life. 

Compared to continuing to burn coal, the use of biomass at Tilbury should save at least 
2.6M tonnes of CO2, as well as reducing SOx emissions by over 80%, NOx emission by 
half, and particulate emission by around 90%. 

In addition to the power generated and 
the associated environmental benefits, 
Tilbury has enabled lessons to be learnt 
to improve the process of biomass 
conversion.  In particular, Tilbury has 
made progress on supply chains and 
the logistics of shipping and storing 
biomass pellets, and will provide 
evidence for the reliability and stability 
of wood pellet combustion as an energy 
source over a sustained period. 

In addition to the energy generated by the plant, the conversion has the potential to make 
Tilbury – on the banks of the Thames – a hub for the import of biomass into the UK.  The 
jetty at Tilbury has capacity to import 4m tonnes of biomass every year which can be used 
to generate heat, electricity or both. These imports are nearly double what is required by 
the plant. 


 

Generation from waste feedstock 

3.142 Our analysis suggests that developers must overcome additional challenges 
in relation to securing consents and permits, accessing long-term waste fuel 
contracts, and securing finance in order to deploy more innovative biomass 
electricity from waste. Key actions are summarised below for waste 
combustion and advanced thermal technologies, drawing on the recent Waste 
Review which outlines the Government’s ambition for Energy from Waste 
(EfW); Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is considered in the Biomass Heat section.  


 

Planning and consenting 


 

3.143 EfW projects, particularly combustion plant, can face strong opposition from 

local communities, driven by concerns about potential impacts on a range of 
issues from health and traffic generation, to whether waste will be diverted 
from recycling. The Government will ensure that a transparent and robust 
evidence base is available on the opportunities and risks posed by EfW.  




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


76  

3.144 Approximately 80% of the 0.9 GW of electricity from waste projects in the 

pipeline are under 50MW and so will be decided at local level. Reform of the 
local and infrastructure-scale planning systems in England are discussed in 
the onshore wind section above, alongside measures to give local 
communities a greater stake in renewables development. 


 

3.145 Our work with industry suggests that EfW projects suffer from perceived 

uncertainty about the Government’s commitment to the use of waste for 
electricity generation, and the level and surety of long term financial support 
which will be provided for this. There are concerns too about the burden of 
monitoring and sampling work required to measure the biogenic (the 
renewable component) content of mixed waste fuels under the RO. 


 

3.146 To address uncertainty, the Government has set out its commitment to the 

role of EfW within the waste hierarchy as part of the Waste Review and has 
accelerated the timetable for the RO Banding Review. In addition, 
Government  has grandfathered support for biomass electricity from waste 
under the RO where this is generated through CHP plant or advanced 
conversion technologies. To facilitate the use of mixed fuels, the Government 
is working with stakeholders to develop a more reliable and cost effective fuel 
monitoring and sampling approach for application across EfW technologies.  


 

3.147 Wider concerns relate to the burden of regulation, particularly for Advanced 

Conversion Technologies (ACT). The novel nature of the technologies can 
make it challenging for the industry to navigate the Environment Agency 
guidance and environmental permitting rules which do not always recognise 
technical differences between these and standard combustion processes. The 
ACT industry suggest, for example, that applying  criteria intended for 
incinerators make some gasification projects technically infeasible and might 
add up to £1m to a small pyrolysis project. Our analysis indicates that 
resolving these issues could facilitate the deployment of up to 140 MW81 of 
ACT projects currently in the planning pipeline and around a further 20 MW of 
pyrolysis projects.   


 

3.148 It is essential that EfW plants are regulated to provide confidence that they are 

operating safely. Government is taking action to ensure this is done in a way 
that does not create unnecessary barriers to deployment.  


 

Actions 
• Defra will deliver the actions outlined in the recently published Waste Review, 

which aim to overcome barriers to growth in Energy from Waste markets and 
help facilitate community acceptance of waste infrastructure. These include 
publishing a guide to the full range of energy from waste technologies 
available to help decision-makers, and identifying commercially viable routes 
by which communities can realise benefits from hosting recovery 
infrastructure.  

                                            
81 Based on data collected by Arup for their report on the RO Banding review.   




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


77 


• DECC will work with Defra, Welsh Government, EA, and industry on an 
ongoing basis to ensure that waste management legislation does not have 
unintended consequences on development of the energy recovery industry.  

• DECC will work with Defra, Welsh Government, industry and delivery partners 
to develop cost-effective fuel monitoring and sampling systems for accurately 
measuring the renewable content of mixed wastes and waste derived energy. 
Ofgem will announce a decision on the use of methodologies based on 
carbon-14 dating by summer 2011.   


 

Accessing long-term waste fuel contracts  


 

3.149 Many EfW projects are financed on the basis of securing long-term waste 

supply contracts with local authorities. However, by the nature of their long 
duration, as the use of EfW increases developers could find it increasingly 
difficult to source appropriate feedstock through this route alone. This is 
because significant quantities of the waste required currently goes to landfill, 
especially commercial and industrial (C&I), and construction and demolition 
(C&D) wastes, including waste wood, which do not usually fall under Local 
Authority control. As a result, contracts for such waste are usually offered on a 
short term basis, which can be a much more challenging environment for 
developers when seeking investment but also represents a significant 
opportunity in terms of the volumes of wastes available.    


 

3.150 To address this issue, the Government is focussing on measures to divert 

waste from landfill including the introduction of possible landfill restrictions for 
waste wood, improved information on the location of C&I and C&D waste and 
the quantities available, and supply chain development.  


 

Actions 
• Defra  will seek to expand capacity to treat C&I and C&D waste through 

improved information on waste supply and composition and developing further 
the supply chains for waste wood and solid recovered fuel. 

• Defra will consult by autumn 2012 on possible measures for landfill 
restrictions for waste wood.  


 

Access to finance  


  

3.151 EfW projects often struggle to secure finance, particularly if they involve the 

use of advanced technologies, which are often untested at commercial scale 
and therefore viewed as high risk. Historically, Private Finance Initiative (PFI) 
has been a key funding model for waste infrastructure, but many other 
facilities are entirely funded by the market. Investment in combustion plant is 
better established but has been hit by the economic downturn. 


 

3.152 To tackle this problem, Government has provided support for a number of 

ACT demonstration projects and is considering how best to target any funding 
available in future years. In addition, it has created the Green Investment 
Bank which could play a role in supporting innovative technologies. 


 

UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


78 


3.153 DECC is working with fellow members of the Low Carbon Innovation Group to 
identify the key innovation needs in a range of technologies, including the 
generation of energy from waste and biomass, to determine how 
Government’s innovation funding can best address them. Subject to the 
conclusion of this work and value for money assessments, funding from 
DECC’s Innovation Programme budget will be available, if needed, to support 
innovation in key technology areas such as the advanced conversion of 
waste. 

Actions  
• Over the next 12 months DECC will continue to consider measures to explore 

ways to reduce the commercial risk of new technologies 
• DECC is expecting to announce details of potential funding to support 

innovation in Autumn 2011, subject to conclusion of innovation needs work 
and value for money assessments. 


 


UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


79 


Biomass Heat 

• In 2010 the UK generated 12.4 TWh82 of renewable heat from biomass, 12.1 TWh of 
this from biomass boilers and 0.3 TWh from Energy from Waste83.   

• The central range suggests that non-domestic biomass heat could contribute up to    
50 TWh by 2020. The majority of this would come from biomass boilers (including 
some from district heating and CHP), with a smaller contribution from biogas injection 
to the gas grid. This central range requires an annual growth rate of up to 17%.  

• The Government does not currently collect pipeline data for renewable heat on a 
routine basis but will do so from the end of 2011.  

• Constraints on deployment include: technology cost, supply chain for sustainable fuel, 
air quality regulation, planning and environmental permitting, investor confidence, and 
the costs associated with biogas injection into the gas grid.   


 

Priority actions: 
• Technology costs: Implement the RHI in Great Britain to make renewable heat from 

biomass boilers, municipal solid waste and onsite biogas combustion competitive with 
fossil fuel generation. Consult on a scheme to support renewable heat in Northern 
Ireland from April 2012 subject to the agreement of the Northern Ireland Executive.  

• Supply chain for sustainable fuel and qualified engineers: Introduce reporting criteria in 
2011 for the sustainability of biomass used under the RHI and put them on a mandatory 
basis from 2013. Ensure that installations of 45 KWth or less are certified and have 
been installed by MCS (or equivalent) registered engineers. 

• Air quality regulation: Introduce emission performance standards for biomass boilers as 
a condition for receiving RHI to ensure air quality impacts are effectively managed. 

• Planning and environmental permitting: The Environment Agency in 2011 will vary the 
‘Standard Rules’ to enable more AD plant to benefit from this type of environmental 
permit, which are usually easier, quicker and cheaper to obtain than a bespoke permit.   

• Investor confidence: Government is supporting four AD demonstration projects to 
illustrate the effectiveness of this technology in practice and will make RHI available for 
biomethane injection into the gas grid and heat generated by biogas produced from AD. 
Increase the level of support for AD under FITs for projects up to 500 kW subject to 
state aids.  

• Costs associated with biomethane injection into the grid: RHI will include support for 
biomethane injection; review permitting and planning processes with a view to reducing 
compliance requirements if appropriate.  


 

Current deployment 


 

3.154 The UK generated 12.4 TWh of biomass heat in 2010, 12.1TWh of this from 

biomass boilers and 0.3 TWh from Energy from Waste (EfW). The majority of 
heat generation from biomass boilers is in the non-domestic sector84. Most 
installations are large scale (for example, it is estimated that 74% of 

                                            
82 The government does not currently have data on installed capacity for biomass heat. We collect data on the 
quantity of fuel used which is reported in DUKES, but not on the number or size of heating units installed

renewable heat output in Scotland in 2008/09 was from plant of at least 1MW) 
and run on forestry-derived fuel85.  


 

3.155 In terms of EfW, the UK generates heat by the combustion of biogas and 

municipal solid waste (MSW). At the end of 2010, the UK had 46 generating 
on-farm or commercial AD biogas sites, plus a further 146 plants at sewage 
treatment works.  These use the decomposition of wet organic material to 
produce methane rich ‘biogas’, which can be burnt on-site to generate heat or 
electricity or cleaned and injected into the distribution gas network.  


 

Deployment potential 


 

3.156 Figure 22 presents the results of recent analysis of the potential for growth in 

the deployment of non-domestic sector biomass heat86 to 2020. It overlays an 
industry view of the deployment that could be achieved (the ‘industry low’ and 
‘industry high’ scenarios) around a central range.  


 

3.157 The central range indicates that non-domestic biomass heat could contribute 

up to 50 TWh of renewable energy by 2020. The majority of this would come 
from biomass boilers (including district heating & CHP) and biogas injection 
to the gas grid. This central range requires an annual growth rate of up to 
17%. The industry scenarios suggests that the market has the potential to 
bring forward 27-55 TWh of non-domestic biomass heat by 2020.

85 The 74% figures comes from the Scottish Government Renewable Heat Action Plan, 2009. All but one of the 
large scale plant identified operate on forestry derived biomass. 
86 The analysis includes non-domestic biomass boilers, biomass district heating, and biogas injection to the gas 
grid. It also includes the heat output from CHP technology. 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


81 


3.158 The industry low scenario reflects factors such as a low assumed take-up of 
biogas to heat in the industrial sector and low take-up of AD by the livestock 
waste and energy crop industries. The high scenario is based on a set of 
more optimistic assumptions on these variables and our level of success if 
removing barriers to the deployment of biomass boilers.   


 

3.159 Analysis by DECC87 suggests that the levelised cost of non-domestic sector 

biomass heat could vary from £22-£159 per MWh in 2020, largely unchanged 
from £22-£156 in 2010. The large ranges reflect variation in the energy 
efficiency of the buildings being heated88, and the fact that the levelised cost is 
higher on average for biomass district heating than biogas. Costs changes 
over time are muted due to offsetting effects on capital, installation and 
operating costs. Capital and installation costs are projected to fall slightly due 
to learning effects, whilst operating prices are projected to rise with increasing 
feedstock prices. 


 

Deployment pipeline 


 

3.160 At present, the Government does not routinely gather data on the pipeline for 
renewable heat projects. However, we are looking at doing so from later in 
2011. In addition, we will be collecting deployment data on projects that 
benefit from the RHI and RHPP scheme, including information from 
preliminary accreditations. We will use this data to provide greater insight into 
deployment trends and barriers and intend to make this information publicly 
available. 


 

Journey to deployment  


 

3.161 Biomass heat covers a range of technologies, feedstock and distribution 
techniques, all of which face different development and deployment 
challenges. The process for developing two types of biomass heat project is 
illustrated below, with key areas of challenge to deployment highlighted in red.  


 

Non-domestic biomass boilers  

3.162 Discussions with industry suggest that it can take anywhere between 1 month 
and several years to bring a non-domestic biomass boiler from scoping to 
operation. In particular, timing will depend on the specific challenges to 
deployment, the scale of installation and whether it is linked to the 
development of transport infrastructure and buildings e.g. for fuel storage,  
which requires planning permission. Figure 23 outlines the journey for a larger 
scale non-domestic biomass boiler in England. 


  


                                            
87 Based on work by AEA Technology, summarised in section 2.2 of the Roadmap. Due to a lack of reliable data 
we assume that costs for biogas are fixed over time. 
88 This affects the total quantity of heat required in the building, across which the fixed costs of the technology 
are spread. 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


82 


Figure 23: Developer journey map for the deployment of non-domestic boilers 


   

3.163 In general, planning permission is not required for a boiler unless it is in a 

conservation area, but it may be required for the boiler house, fuel silo and 
flue (if exceeding roof height by 1m). If there is likely to be an increase in large 
vehicle movement to deliver and transport fuel, planning permission is more 
likely to be required. The size of installation and type of fuel used dictate 
which permissions and regulators are involved.  


 

Anaerobic digestion to produce biogas 

3.164 Biogas projects generally takes around two years from scoping to operation, 
as illustrated in Figure 24 below, although this can vary from six months for 
small on-farm plant to five years for a large municipal installation. Biogas from 
AD plant can be combusted to produce heat for use on-site or cleaned to 
produce biomethane for injection into the gas grid.

Challenges to deployment and actions 
Non-domestic biomass boilers 

3.165 Our analysis of deployment statistics and discussions with industry suggest 
that there are at least three main challenges to deployment for non-domestic 
biomass boilers in the UK:   


 

Higher cost than fossil fuel alternatives 


 

3.166 Although fuel costs can be lower for biomass boilers than fossil fuel 

generation, equipment and installation costs are significantly higher – not least 
because biomass units need to be larger than typical fossil fuel systems and 
require additional fuel storage and feeding systems. In addition, hurdle rates 
are increased by the dependency on a new fuel source, which raises the risk 
of supply interruption, and for projects exporting heat, by the risk that the 
customer will go out of business. These are all factors which increase the 
implicit cost of investment. 


 

3.167 Without action to tackle cost, it is unlikely that deployment will increase much 

from current levels. This puts much of the additional 11-21 TWh89 of heat from 
biomass boilers anticipated in the central range at risk.  

                                            
89 Central range for biomass boilers within composite central range for biomass heat.  




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


84  

3.168 To address this, the Government is introducing the RHI in Great Britain to 

provide support to organisations installing eligible renewable heating systems, 
including standard and CHP biomass boilers, biomass energy from MSW and 
biogas combustion. The RHI will provide a stream of payments over a 20 year 
period, covering its additional cost in comparison to the fossil fuel alternative 
and a rate of return on investment. 


 

3.169 The Government is considering the case for supporting bioliquids under the 

RHI from 2012. For Combined Heat and Power – where at present the 
renewable heat element is recognised by an uplift to the RO – DECC will use 
the Banding Review to clarity the relative roles of the RO and RHI in 
supporting this form of generation. This will give biomass electricity producers 
greater clarity about the benefits of exploiting waste renewable heat from their 
electricity generation. Northern Ireland is currently considering the introduction 
of a scheme to encourage uptake of renewable heat. 


 

Action:  
• DECC have laid the regulations for establishing the RHI for Parliamentary 

approval in July 2011.   
• DECC will use the 2011 Banding Review to clarify the relative roles of the RO 

and RHI in supporting Combined Heat and Power schemes. 
• Northern Ireland Executive will consult over the summer with the goal of 

having a scheme in place by 1 April 2012 subject to agreement by the 
Northern Ireland Executive.  


 

Supply chain for sustainable feedstock and qualified engineers 


 

3.170 Although national and global markets for sustainable biomass are developing 

rapidly, they are still less mature than markets for conventional fossil fuels. As 
a result, prospective generators of biomass heat sometimes struggle to 
secure a long-term source of sustainable feedstock, either from within the UK, 
the EU or beyond.  In addition, although UK companies are increasingly 
focusing on installation, operation and maintenance, developers still report a 
lack of qualified engineers to install and maintain biomass boilers. These 
factors could constrain progress in deploying the additional 11 – 21 TWh of 
biomass boilers anticipated in the central range90.  


 

3.171 To facilitate the development of a sustainable supply chain the RHI will require 
generators of 1MWth and above, including biomethane producers, to provide 
quarterly reports on the biomass they use, including the quantity, type, form 
and country of origin, and whether an environmental accreditation has been 
met. It will use this information to inform the development of mandatory 
criteria, which generators must meet from 2013 onwards to qualify for support 
under the RHI. 


 

                                            
90 Central range for biomass boilers within composite central range for biomass heat.  


 

UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


85 


3.172 The RHI will help too in stimulating the supply chain for engineers in the UK, 
encouraging more installers to apply for the relevant competent persons 
scheme required to meet Building Regulations. In the domestic sector, 
installers will need to belong to the Microgeneration Certification Scheme 
(MCS) 91 or equivalent if homeowners wish to claim the Renewable Heat 
Premium Payment (RHPP).  


 

Action: 
• To facilitate development of sustainable feedstock the Government will 

introduce reporting criteria in 2011 for the sustainability of biomass used 
under the RHI and make these criteria mandatory from 2013 for the receipt of 
RHI.  

• To stimulate the supply chain for qualified engineers, the Government will 
ensure that certain installations of 45 kWth or less must be certified under 
MCS or equivalent and must have been installed by MCS certified engineers 
(or equivalent) to receive the RHI or RHPP.  


 

Air quality regulation  


 

3.173 Biomass boilers generate particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which fall 

under our legally binding EU air quality targets. However, whilst there is 
regulation to control these emissions from biomass boilers of 20 MWth or 
more, there is no similar framework for smaller units. Uncertainty over 
approval rates results from a lack of clear regulation on air quality impacts for 
boilers under 20 MWth. 


 

Action: 
• DECC is planning under phase 2 of the RHI to introduce emission 

performance standards for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides as a 
condition for biomass boilers of less than 20MWth to be eligible for support. 


 

Anaerobic Digestion to produce biogas  

3.174 Whilst many of the barriers to generating heat from waste are similar to those 
for biomass electricity from waste (discussed in section 3.1.4 above), there 
are a number of challenges which are specific to AD and biogas injection that 
also require attention. The Government published its Anaerobic Digestion 
Strategy in June 201192 outlining a joint programme of work with industry on 
barriers to AD. Action is under way in a number of areas already.  


     

                                            
91 MCS is a UK wide scheme and any Northern Ireland renewable heat incentivisation programme will 
also require installers to be registered with MCS.

UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


86 


Case study:  BV Dairy Anaerobic Digestion Plant 

BV Dairy in Dorset has installed a £2.3million 
innovative anaerobic digestion plant.  This uses 
50,000 tonnes a year of liquid waste from their 
dairy and food processing plant to generate 
renewable heat and electricity. The biogas from 
the AD plant is fed to a 190kWe combined heat 
and power engine which generates 2.1 GWh of 
electricity and 1.7 GWh of heat per year.   

The electricity is used in the food manufacturing operation, and the surplus is exported 
to the national grid.  Some of the heat is used to keep the digester at the correct 
temperature and the rest is used in the manufacturing operation to replace heat that was 
previously generated by oil burning boilers.  BV Dairy will cut its carbon footprint by 
about 60% - reducing its output of carbon by about 1,200 tonnes per year.   


 

Planning and environmental permitting 


 

3.175 Industry indicate that in their view, environmental permitting rules place an 

undue burden on AD projects given the typical size of plant and the limited 
risks they pose. The factors increase development cost, introduce delays, and 
threaten some of the projects that could be built by 2020. 


 

3.176 To reduce regulatory burdens, the Environment Agency (EA) will this year 

amend the relevant Standard Rules to enable more AD plant to benefit from 
this type of environmental permit, which are usually easier, quicker, and 
cheaper to obtain than a bespoke permit. The Government is reforming the 
planning system in England to ensure that the sustainable development 
needed to support economic growth is able to proceed as easily as possible. 
This embraces a range of measures which should make it easier to obtain 
planning permission for appropriately-sited AD plants. 


 

Action: 
• The EA will, in 2011, amend the relevant Standard Rules to enable more AD 

plant to benefit from this type of environmental permit.   


 

Investor confidence 


 

3.177 Large AD projects – particularly those at commercial scale or for which the 
biogas produced is intended for the gas grid – are at a very early stage of 
development in the UK and as such are perceived as high risk by investors.  


 

3.178 To boost investor confidence, DECC and Defra are supporting four AD 

demonstration projects. These projects will help demonstrate the 
effectiveness of AD plants working in practice.  


 


UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


87 


3.179 In addition, the Government will, from the start of the RHI scheme in 2011, 
make RHI payments available for biomethane injection into the gas grid and 
the generation of heat from biogas produced from all wastes through AD. This 
will ensure a stream of payments for projects over a twenty year period, 
improving their financial attractiveness to investors. In June 2011 the 
Government announced that it will also be increasing the level of support for 
AD of up to 500kW for new entrants to the Feed-in Tariff. This change is due 
to take effect from 1st August 201193, bolstering the level of financial support 
available for farm-scale AD in the UK.    


 

Action: 
• Government will publish findings from its four AD demonstration projects in 

spring 2012 to increase the availability of information about AD to the market.  
• DECC will provide support for biomethane injection and all wastes used to 

create biogas through AD under the RHI from 2011. 
• DECC, subject to state aid clearance, will increase the level of support 

available under the FIT scheme for new AD projects of up to 500 kW from 1 St 
August 2011. 


 

Costs associated with biogas injection into the gas grid 


 

3.180 Biogas must be cleaned and transported before it can be injected into the gas 

grid on health and safety grounds. Therefore, injection is currently a more 
costly option than using biogas onsite for heat generation. These costs relate 
for example to the need to reduce the concentration of oxygen and 
contaminants, and to obtain grid injection equipment and a gas transporter 
licence. They serve as a disincentive to deployment and could risk much of 
the addition 3-6 TWh anticipated from biogas injection in the central range.  


 

3.181 In addition to providing RHI for biogas injection, the Government is working 

with range of delivery partners to consider whether it is appropriate to amend 
some of the regulations which currently apply to biogas injection from AD 
plant.  


 

Actions:

Case study:  Thames Water Biogas to the Electricity Grid 

In October 2010, Thames Water’s Didcot sewage 
treatment works in Oxfordshire became the first UK site to 
feed renewable gas into the national gas grid, so helping 
to de-carbonise the grid. Sludge, the solid part of sewage, 
is treated in an anaerobic digester to produce biogas.  
This is then cleaned to remove impurities.   

The resulting biomethane is of a suitable quality to be fed 
into the gas grid as a replacement for natural gas. The 
whole process - from flushing a toilet to the gas entering 
the grid - takes around 20 days  The biomethane output is sufficient to meet the needs of 
up to 200 homes. The project was a joint venture between Thames Water, British Gas and 
Scotia Gas Networks.  It took six months to complete and cost £2.5m.

Ground source heat pumps and air source heat 
pumps 

• There are approximately 37,000 air and ground source heat pumps installed across 
the UK. This equates to around 0.6 GWth in terms of installed capacity, generating 
0.7 TWh at the end of 201094.    

• The central range suggests that non-domestic heat pumps could contribute up to    
22 TWh by 2020, 14 TWh of this from ground source heat pumps and 9 TWh from air 
source. This central range requires an annual growth rate of up to 41%.  

• Constraints on deployment include: technology cost; planning & licensing processes; 
thin installer base; demands on the electricity grid; and performance & technical 
issues.  


 

Priority actions:  

• Technology costs: Introducing the RHI and the RHPP for eligible heat pumps from 
2011 and 2012 respectively. 

• Planning and licensing processes: Introducing permitted development rights for air 
source heat pumps on domestic properties in England, confirmation of details 
expected very shortly.  

• Availability of good quality installers and engineers: Developing national occupational 
standard and competences for installers, and consulting on extending the 
Microgeneration Certification Scheme (which covers heat pumps up to 45kWth) to 
ensure equipment meet high standards.  

• Demands on the electricity grid: Monitoring usage patterns and the grid impact of 
existing installations, whilst setting Government’s strategy for the future of our 
distribution networks. 

• Performance and technical issues:

Current deployment 

 Ensure that RHI is only available to eligible heat 
pumps with a Coefficient of Performance of greater than 2.9. Undertaking UK studies 
and field trials to gain data on the variation in performance of heat pumps across 
installations to ensure efficiency.  

3.180 Initial analysis for DECC suggests that the UK has around  37,000 units95 
(equating to around 0.6 GWth of capacity), 28,000 of which are in the 
domestic sector (0.2 GWth) and 8,500 in the non-domestic sector (0.4 GWth).  


 

3.181 Most of those in the domestic sector are installed in newly built housing. The 
retrofit market is currently quite small but the RHPP, domestic RHI, and 
actions set out in the Microgeneration Strategy will help the market to expand 
further.   


 

Deployment potential 
3.182 Figure 25 presents the results of recent analysis of the potential for growth in 

the deployment of non-domestic  air and ground source heat pumps to 2020.

It overlays an industry view of the deployment that could be achieved (the 
‘industry low’ and ‘industry high’ scenarios) around a central range. 


 

3.183 The central range suggests that non-domestic heat pumps could contribute up 
to 22 TWh (equivalent to around 100,000 installations). Of this, ground source 
heat pumps are expected to contribute 14 TWh, with a contribution of 9 TWh 
from air source heat pumps. This central range requires an annual growth rate 
of up to 41%. The industry scenarios suggest that the market has the potential 
to bring forward 12-51 TWh of non-domestic heat pumps by 2020. 


 

3.184 The exact generation and installation levels will depend on the relative 
demand for different renewables heat technologies, including the mix between 
domestic heat pumps and larger, commercial units.  


 

Figure 25: Deployment potential to 2020 for non-domestic heat pumps 


 

3.185 The industry low scenario is based on the assumption that annual growth 
rates tail off slightly from 2010 to 2020, the high projection on the assumption 
that growth rates increase considerably. The large spread between these 
trajectories is reflective of the opportunities and risks associated with new 
technology markets. Key uncertainties for heat pumps include the rate of 
innovation to improve technology performance, demand response to the RHI, 
the speed at which the installer base grows, and likely public perceptions. 


 

3.186 The industry high scenario implies a substantial increase in peak load 
electricity demand, which would require reinforcement of local grid networks. 
DECC monitors electricity usage patterns and has published a strategy for the 
future of our distribution networks alongside the EMR white paper. The high 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


91 


trajectory is demanding but, as analysis for the IEA96 shows, similarly high 
rates of deployment have been achieved in other EU Member States in recent 
years.  


 

3.187 Analysis by DECC97 suggests that the cost of non-domestic sector heat 

pumps could range from £42-£67 per MWh for 2020, down slightly from £44-
£75 in 2010. These ranges reflect variation in the energy efficiency of the 
buildings being heated98, and the fact that capital cost is lower on average for 
air-source than ground-source heat pumps. Cost reductions over time are 
muted due to conflicting changes in capital, installation and operating costs. 
Whilst capital and installation costs are expected to fall in response to learning 
effects, operating costs are expected to rise with increasing electricity prices. 


 

Deployment pipeline 


 

3.188 Government does not currently gather statistics on the deployment pipeline for  

new heat pump installation. We will also be collecting data on heat pumps 
deployed under the RHI  and RHPP. We will use this information to provide 
greater insight into deployment trends and barriers, and intend to make this 
publicly available.

source heat pumps, and the groups and bodies involved, with key challenges 
to deployment highlighted in red. 


 

3.190 Our analysis suggests that for a non-domestic air source heat pump the 

average time from scoping to operation is around five months. Lead times are 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


93 


harder to interpret for ground source heat pumps99 as these are usually 
installed as part of wider civil or building works, but preliminary analysis 
suggests that this can take around six months if planning permission and 
environmental permitting are not required. If consents are needed, the 
process is longer with environmental permitting usually lasting at least a year.  

Challenges to deployment and actions 
3.191 Our analysis of deployment statistics and discussions with industry suggest 

that developers face challenges relating to cost, performance, market infancy 
(on the demand and supply side) and regulation in deploying heat pumps. 
Some factors impact differently for domestic and non-domestic customers and 
for ground- and air-source technology.  


 

Technology cost 


 

3.192 Heat pumps are more expensive to purchase and install than conventional 

fossil fuel heating. Fuel bill savings are often insufficient to recoup these costs 
in the short to medium term, particularly for domestic customers and those 
who were previously served by gas. Cost is a barrier for both air and ground 
source technologies and could risk most, if not all, of the central deployment 
range of 16-22 TWh by 2020. 


 

3.193 The RHI will provide support for the deployment of eligible non-domestic heat 

pumps. The scheme will cover ground and water source heat pumps, and is 
due to be launched later in 2011. Air source heat pumps are not covered at 
present, but DECC is looking  to include air source heat pumps from 2012, 
subject to feasibility, affordability, and a value for money assessment. The 
scheme will be extended to include the domestic sector alongside the Green 
Deal. Northern Ireland is currently considering the details of their renewable 
heat incentive programme.  


 

3.194 In addition, DECC is providing up to £15million of support to households 

under the RHPP, which will include air source and ground source heat pumps, 
and will be launched this Summer.  


 

Action: 
• The RHI for the non-domestic sector will be open for application from Autumn 

2011.  
• Northern Ireland Executive will consult over the summer with the goal of 

having a scheme in place by 1 April 2012 subject to agreement by the 
Northern Ireland Executive.  


 

Planning and licensing processes 


 

3.195 Developers report that there are delays in the planning process for air-source 

heat pumps and the environmental permitting process for ground source heat 
pumps. 


 

                                            
99 Open or closed loop 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


94 


3.196 Open-loop ground source heat pumps must be licensed by the EA to ensure 
that they do not have an adverse effect on the environment. The EA indicate 
that this process can take up to a year to complete, including time to drill a 
borehole. These factors add to the cost and timing of developments, and 
could prevent deployment rates from rising as anticipated in the central 
deployment range. 


 

3.197 The EA is working to streamline the licensing process for open-loop ground 

source heat pumps, including through the publication of guidance for 
developers making applications. The Government is working to deliver 
permitted development rights in England for some air source heat pumps 
installed on domestic properties, and to consider doing the same for 
installations on non-domestic premises. This will remove the requirement for 
express planning permission from the local council for some installations. 


 

Action: 
• The EA have issued guidance advising developers of best practice when 

applying for an environmental permit for open-loop ground source heat 
pumps. 

• DCLG will report to Parliament on the introduction of permitted development 
rights for air source heat pumps on non-domestic land in England. 


 

Performance and technical issues 

3.198 Field trials100 indicate that the performance of heat pumps in the domestic 
sector can vary considerably across installations. There is concern too that 
heat pumps can require more maintenance than standard boilers. 


 

3.199 Variation in performance is a particular issue for the domestic sector where 

installations are not yet commonplace (installation quality is crucial to 
determining performance), customers are inexperienced in using their heat 
pumps efficiently, and it is common to rely on off-the-shelf units which may not 
be ideally sized. Underperformance must be tackled. Under EU rules only 
heat pumps with a coefficient of performance101 (CoP) of 2.9 or more are 
eligible to count towards the 15% target. It could also impact public attitudes 
and limit demand. 


 

3.200 Together these factors could substantially limit the level of progress possible 

towards the central deployment range of 16-22 TWh by 2020. 


 

3.201 To improve data on performance, DECC has asked the Energy Saving Trust 

to use the second round of the heat pumps field trial to monitor modifications 
to poorly performing sites and gather further data. Government will also 
consider emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used as heat pump 
refrigerants to ensure consistency with existing regulations and ongoing 
discussions on phasing down of HFC production and consumption. DECC will 
be closely monitoring heat pumps and other technologies receiving support

under the RHPP scheme through metering and through survey responses, to 
understand better how the systems perform in a variety of different situations 
and how actual performance measures up against manufacturer and installer 
claims. In addition, DECC has commissioned laboratory experiments on heat 
pump performance and Thermostatic Radiator Valves. 


 

3.202 To ensure that only good quality equipment and installers are incentivised, 

DECC will ensure only eligible heat pumps with a CoP of 2.9 or greater will be 
eligible for support under the RHI. Under the RHPP, households support will 
only be available for households using an installer who is accredited under the 
Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) or equivalent. To maximise the 
impact of the MCS, DECC will tighten its standards on training and the 
technical abilities of installers and will extend the scheme to heat pumps of 
more than 45kWth.  


 

Action: 
• DECC will ensure that, from the inception of the RHI scheme in 2011, it is only 

available for heat pumps with a CoP of 2.9 or greater. 
• DECC will ensure that, from the inception of the RHPP scheme, it is only 

available for households using an MCS certified installers or equivalent. 
• DECC will in 2011-12 use laboratory research, the RHPP, and the second 

round of the EST heat pump field trial to collect data on how best to improve 
heat pump performance.  


 

Availability of good quality installers and engineers 


 

3.203 The Heat and Hot Water Task Force102 indicates a lack of good-quality heat 

pumps installers in the UK. In particular, it suggests that the UK will need in 
the order of 8,000-10,000 heat pump installers to deliver the estimation levels 
of generation required by 2020. Installers will need to have appropriate skills 
to ensure high quality installation. In addition, as illustrated in the developer 
journey charts above, ground source heat pumps will require specialist input 
from drilling and bore hole engineers. 


 

3.204 Without an increase in the availability of skilled installers and engineers, it is 

unlikely that heat pumps will be deployed at the rates required to meet the 
21TWh upper end of the central deployment range. 


 

3.205 The Government is taking action to stimulate the supply chain directly and 

indirectly by stimulating the demand for renewable heat technologies.  


 

3.206 The RHI and RHPP will stimulate demand for renewable heat technologies by 

lowering their effective cost for those wishing to install. We anticipate that this 
will encourage additional training and R&D in the British renewables industry, 
ultimately increasing the availability of skilled installers. RHI will be launched 
for the commercial and industrial sector in 2011, and we will monitor its impact 
on both deployment and underlying development of the market

3.207 The Sector Skills Council (Summit Skills) is developing a national 

occupational standard and competence framework to encourage upskilling 
more directly in the heat pump industry. Details of the scheme, which will 
initially apply to the domestic sector, are set out in the Microgeneration 
Strategy, published in June 2011.   


 

3.208 In addition, the Microgeneration Strategy sets out a full action plan for on-site 
renewable heat technologies. This covers the range of non-financial barriers 
to deployment developed together with the industry and to be taken forward 
by them including: certification; assessment; warranties; technology; 
information. 


 

Action: 
• DECC will establish the RHI from 2011 onwards to stimulate the demand for 

renewable heat and with it the supply chain for high quality installers.   
• The Sector Skills Council (Summit Skills) will, by the end of 2011, revise the 

national occupational standard and competency framework for  heat pump 
installers.

Renewable Energy in Transport   

• In 2010 the UK met 14.1 TWh of its energy demand for transport from renewable 
sources, equivalent to 3.6% of road transport energy demand and up from 0.2% in 
2005103.  

• The Government is committed to meeting the transport sub-target in the Renewable 
Energy Directive (RED).  

• Proposed biofuel usage to 2014 was set out in the Department for Transport’s recent 
consultation on transport elements of the RED and the greenhouse gas savings 
requirements of the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD). Currently, the levels as set in the 
Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation are for 4% in 2011/12, 4.5% in 2012/13 and 5% 
for 2013/14 and onwards. 

• For the period beyond 2014 the Government is continuing to develop its evidence base 
on sustainability and deployment and, subject to the outcome of the recent 
consultations, will consult in Spring 2012 on possible trajectories for biofuels supply 
beyond 2014, with a further consultation on proposed legislative changes in late 2012.   

• Challenges to the increased usage of renewable energy in transport include: potential 
sustainability issues around biofuel supply and considerations for best deployment 
across modes and sectors; the need for  investment in infrastructure; the current 
additional up-front cost of ultra-low emission vehicles in relation to fossil-fuel 
alternatives; and support for innovation.  


 

Priority actions:  
• Biofuel sustainability and deployment


• 

: DfT’s recent consultation on the RED and the 
FQD include proposals to introduce mandatory sustainability criteria for biofuels. In 
addition, DfT will examine proposals due from the EU in July 2011 for action on Indirect 
Land Use Change impacts and will shortly publish work on the best use of biofuels 
across modes. 
Plug-In Vehicle Infrastructure:


• 

 DfT, BIS and DECC (through the Office of Low Emission 
Vehicles – OLEV) are supporting the Plugged-In Places programme. Eight areas are 
installing charging infrastructure for plug-in vehicles and  in June  2011, OLEV 
published a strategy for plug-in vehicle infrastructure in the UK. 
Financial support for the purchase of ultra-low emission  vehicles


• 

: OLEV launched the 
Plug-in Car Grant in January 2011 providing a 25% subsidy (up to £5000) for the 
purchase of eligible ultra-low emission cars which meet safety, environmental and 
performance standards. 
Support for  innovation


 

: Funding to support further development of low carbon vehicle 
technologies by identifying priority technologies for innovation, and funding through the 
SET Plan initiatives. 


 

Current deployment 


 

3.209 In 2010 the UK met 14.1 TWh of its energy demand for transport from 

renewable sources, equivalent to 3.6% of road transport demand and up from 
0.2% in 2005104.  


 

                                            
103 Under the Renewable Energy Directive measure, all renewable transport contributed 13.3 TWh, or 2.9% 
towards capped transport target (excluding air). Source: Energy Trends June 2011 
104 As above 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 


98 


3.210 Renewable energy is more widely used at present in road transport than in 
rail, shipping, or aviation. The vast majority of usage in the road transport 
sector has been in biofuels, driven by the Renewable Transport Fuel 
Obligation, which requires that suppliers of fossil fuel for road transport to 
source a proportion of their supply from biofuels.  


 

3.211 The RFTO target level for the financial year 2009-10 was 3.25%, against 

which 3.33%105 was delivered – 71% of this from biodiesel, 29% from 
bioethanol and under 1% from biomethane. Around 15% of the feedstock for 
this fuel was waste material.  


 

3.212 At the end of 2010 there were 11,500 low-emission (including electric) 
vehicles in the UK, used in road transport106.    


 

Deployment potential 


 

3.213 The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets a target for the UK to source 

10% of its energy used for all forms of transport107 from renewable sources by 
2020. Biofuels made from wastes, residues and ligno-cellulosic material count 
double towards the 10% target, and electric vehicles by a factor of 2.5. 
Biofuels used must meet sustainability standards on biodiversity and 
embedded emissions from growth and processing (discussed in more detail 
below).  


 

3.214 Figure 27 presents a trajectory delivering up to 48 TWh of renewable energy 

in transport by 2020. As described below, it illustrates that while there is 
certainty over the level of deployment expected to 2014, Government has not 
yet finalised the pathway for renewable transport for the period between 
2014–2020 including the role of wastes, advanced biofuels and electric 
vehicles.    


 

3.215 Whilst renewable energy in transport is vital to help meet our ambitions for 

renewable energy and carbon reduction, it must be from sustainable sources. 
There are concerns that the mandatory RED sustainability criteria for biofuels 
do not address key issues such as Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC), and this 
has implications for the 10% transport sub-target. Until these are resolved we 
must take a cautious approach to the level of biofuels used in transport.

3.216 Government is currently undertaking extensive analysis and engaging with 

stakeholders to consider these issues. The recent consultations on the 
transport elements of the RED and the greenhouse gas (GHG) savings 
requirements of the FQD, set out a proposal to place a legal obligation on the 
Secretary of State for Transport to consider what additional measures will be 
required to ensure that the UK delivers the requirements of the RED and FQD 
in the period 2014 to 2020. Subject to the results of this consultation, DfT will 
consult in 2012 on the possible approach for renewable transport for the 
period between 2014–20, including the contribution from biofuels, and will 
make the required legislative changes in 2013.      


 

Analytical work to define pathway beyond 2014   


 

3.217 A key element of our work to define a pathway beyond 2014 is the Bioenergy 

Strategy which Government is developing with the Devolved Administrations. 
This will examine the likely supply of sustainable bioenergy to the UK from 
domestic and international sources to 2050 given competing demand from 
abroad and other sectors, and will look at how best to apportion this resource 
between transport, heat and electricity in the UK considering issues of cost-
effectiveness and potential GHG savings. It will consider the importance of 
exploiting UK feedstocks such as waste, which do not present obvious 
sustainability concerns.  


 

3.218 For the transport sector specifically, DfT has commissioned analytical work to 

produce scenarios for the cost-effective deployment of biofuels across UK 
aviation, rail, shipping, and various form of road transport out to 2050. This will 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 



100 


look at the relative cost-effectiveness of using the available resource in 
different modes given, for example, the availability – or not – of other options 
for reducing emissions. DfT will publish a suite of research reports from this 
work in summer 2011. 


 

3.219 On aviation, DfT published a call for evidence document108 in March 2011 

outlining the proposed scope of its work to develop a long term, sustainable 
framework for UK aviation. The call for evidence, which closes on 30th 
September 2011, outlines the range of issues which DfT propose to consider, 
including the potentially crucial role of biofuels in this sector given the lack of 
other options available for reducing emissions.   


 

3.220 The Government will use these pieces of work and advice from the Committee 

on Climate Change on the best use of bioenergy in the UK (expected in 
November) to inform its strategy for renewable transport.  


 

Challenges to deployment and actions 


 

3.221 The UK will need to overcome four main challenges in order to increase the 

usage of sustainable renewable energy in transport in line with the 10% 
transport sub-target.  


 

Assuring the sustainability of biofuel supplies  


 

3.222 For biofuels to be beneficial they must be produced sustainability. It particular, 

their production should not place undue pressure on areas of high 
biodiversity, and they must deliver real emissions savings in comparison to 
the fossil fuels they are replacing.  


 

3.223 The RED and FQD contain mandatory sustainability criteria for biofuels. 

These criteria include that biofuels, with some exceptions, must deliver 
greenhouse gas savings of at least 35% when compared to fossil fuels and 
that biofuels must not be sourced from areas of high biodiversity, or from high 
carbon soils (e.g. rainforests or wetlands). DfT consulted on the 
implementation of these criteria, proposing that only biofuels meeting the 
required standards would count towards Renewable Transport Fuel 
Obligation109. The consultation closed on 2 June.  


 

3.224 On the issue of ILUC, where the cultivation of biofuel feedstock on existing 

agricultural land results in the displacement of production on to previously 
uncultivated land, the European Commission will bring forward proposals by 
the end of July 2011.  The UK will examine these proposals as a matter of 
priority in the light of its own analytical work on this issue.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/open/2011-09/consultationdocument.pdf  
109 The exception is biofuels produced from waste and residues (other than agricultural, aquaculture, fisheries 
and forestry residues), which are treated differently. As these are not derived from crops, they are viewed as 
prima facie sustainable and must only meet the criterion of delivering a GHG savings of at least 35%. 


 

UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 



101  

3.225 Consideration also needs to be given to the role of advanced biofuels and 

those produced from waste that count twice towards targets under the RED. 


 

Actions:  
• Government will assess the European Commission’s proposals due to be 

published in July 2011. We will consider whether the proposals are 
appropriate with a view to ensuring effective standards on Indirect Land Use 
Change.   


  

Infrastructure and supply chain development  

3.226 Investment will be needed in infrastructure and the UK supply chain to support 
the increased usage of plug-in vehicles to 2020 and beyond. For plug-in 
vehicles, investment in charging infrastructure may be needed so that 
motorists can charge their plug-in vehicles safely and conveniently across the 
country.  


 

3.227 The Plugged-In Places programme provides match-funding to consortia of 

business and the public sector for eight schemes across the UK (London, 
Milton Keynes, the North East of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Greater 
Manchester, the Midlands and the East of England), to support the installation 
of a critical mass of charging points in each area.  


 

3.228 The Office of Low Emission Vehicles have recently published Making the 

Connection: the Plug in Infrastructure Strategy drawing on evidence 
generated about driver behaviour from the Plugged-In Places programme and 
other trials taking place in the UK and overseas.  


 

Actions: 
• Government has made available up to £30m available for to support the 

Plugged-in Places programme. 


  

Upfront cost of Ultra Low Emission Vehicles 

3.229 Ultra low-emission vehicles such as electric vehicles are still an emerging 
technology and are not yet produced in large numbers. As a result, their 
upfront cost to customers is currently higher than that of conventionally fuelled 
vehicles.  


 

3.230 The Government believes that ultra-low emission vehicles have an important 

role to play in the long term decarbonisation of UK transport. It is taking action 
to create a more level playing field between the cost of new and existing 
technologies, until scale effects drive the cost of new technologies down to a 
more competitive level.  


 

3.231 In its 2011 Spending Review the Government confirmed more than £400m of 

support for the Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) for the lifetime of this 
Parliament. This includes funding for the ‘Plug-in Car Grant’ scheme which 
was launched in January 2011 to provide customers buying an electric, plug-




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap

in hybrid, or hydrogen-fuelled car with a grant equal to 25% of the vehicle 
purchase price, up to a value of £5,000. The scheme is available for private 
and business customers, and cars bought must comply with performance, 
environmental and safety standards in order to be eligible.   


 

Actions: 
• In the 2011 Spending Review, the Government confirmed more than £400m 

of support for Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) over the lifetime of this 
Parliament.  

• In January 2011 DfT launched the ‘Plug-in Car Grant’, providing a 25% grant 
– up to £5000 – for the purchase of electric, plug-in hybrid, or hydrogen-
fuelled cars.  


 

Case study:  Supporting the take-up of ultra-low emission cars 

The Government announced the first nine electric and ultra-low emission cars eligible for 
the Plug-In Car Grant in December 2010. These are: the Mitsubishi i-MiEV; Smart fortwo 
electric drive; Peugeot iOn; Nissan Leaf; Tata Vista; Citroen CZero; Vauxhall Ampera; 
Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid; and the Chevrolet Volt. The Renault Fluence joined the list in 
June 2011.  


 

The scheme began on 1 January 2011, 
reducing the cost of vehicles by 25%, up 
to £5,000. 


 

The Plugged-In Places scheme supports 
eight projects around the country. These 
projects have successfully bid for a 
share of a £30 million fund aimed at 
encouraging a new network of plug-in 
vehicle recharging points in streets, 
homes and sites such as car parks and 
commercial retail and leisure facilities. 
The successful Plugged-In Places 
consortia are based in: the Midlands; 
Greater Manchester; East of England; 
Scotland; Northern Ireland; London; 
Milton Keynes; and the North East. 


  

Support for innovation  

3.232 Ongoing research and development work is required to support the 
development and deployment of the emerging generation of new ultra low 
carbon vehicles. Government provides funding to support specific programmes 
of work in this area, including the development of new engines for plug-in hybrid 
cars to improve vehicle performance and materials that reduce vehicle weight. 
This funding includes supporting the Technology Strategy Board's Low Carbon 
Vehicle Innovation Platform which invests jointly with industry in research and 




UK Renewable Energy Roadmap 



103 


development to help UK-based businesses maximise the economic benefits 
associated with a developing ULEV market. 


 

3.233 Recent studies110 commissioned by Government indicate that advanced 

technologies may be an important element of meeting our needs to 2020, and 
increasingly valuable post 2020 as we move towards a low carbon transport 
system. Key areas already identified as potential routes include 
thermochemical conversion which can produce mid-distillates such as 
biodiesel and jet fuel.  Developing these fuels will reduce the use of 
agricultural land needed for food, and increase the use of wastes for energy, 
as well as generating high lifecycle greenhouse gas savings.   


 

3.234 DfT’s recent consultation proposed introducing double rewards for biofuels 

made from  wastes, residues and non-food cellulosic and ligno-cellulosic 
materials. The UK are involved in securing key future funding routes, such as 
the EU’s Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan. The SET Plan outlines 
what needs to be done from an EU perspective to achieve its 2020 energy 
and emission targets and 2050 vision.  Its objectives are: sustainability; 
security of supply; and retaining EU competitiveness.  The UK is a strong 
supporter of the SET Plan and DECC is engaged with the UK funding 
organisations (Research Councils, TSB, Carbon Trust, ETI); multiplier 
organisations; and individual companies and research organisations, to 
promote and encourage SET Plan engagement.   


 

3.235 DECC is working with fellow members of the Low Carbon Innovation Group to 

identify the key innovation needs in a range of technologies, including the 
generation of energy from waste and biomass, to determine how 
Government’s innovation funding can best address them. Subject to the 
conclusion of this work and value for money assessments, funding from 
DECC’s Innovation Programme budget will be available, if needed, to support 
innovation in key technology areas such as the advanced conversion of 
waste. 


 

Actions:  
• The Government has made provision of around £80 million to support a 

programme of research and development of programme research and 
development in ultra-low carbon technologies. The most recent competition is 
aimed at highly innovative collaborative R&D technologies, feasibility studies 
of disruptive technologies and the feasibility of automotive battery recycling 
and re-use.   

• Government has contributed to a total award of £24 million for six projects 
through which large vehicle manufacturers will help to grow the supply chain 
for a low carbon vehicles industry within the UK by working together with small 
to medium sized enterprises to provide support and a potential route to a 
growing market.

Chapter 4: Supporting delivery  
A Process for Delivery 

4.1 The development and publication of this Roadmap is the first step in an 
ongoing process. We will publish a revised document annually to update on 
progress, and to reflect any new additions to our evidence base which arise 
from collaborative working with stakeholders.  


 

Figure 28: Annual Roadmap cycle 


  

4.2 Through the course of Chapter 3 we have set out actions against a range of 

renewable technologies from the electricity, heat and transport sectors. Future 
editions of the Roadmap will report progress against these activities and 
analyse their impact in alleviating the barriers to deployment.  


 

Monitoring and Reporting Progress  

4.3 We will be monitoring several key areas as indicators of progress and to 
support our evidence base: 
• consumption of renewable energy; 
• renewable energy deployment and pipeline; 
• reasons for project failure and barriers to delivery; 
• impact of policy activity; 
• changes to technology costs. 


 

4.4 The level of overall renewable energy consumption in the UK is the key 

indicator for reporting progress to the European Commission for both the 
interim targets and against the 15% target to be achieved by 2020. The UK 
interim targets are set at 4% for the period 2011-12, then 5.4% for 2013-14, 
7.5% for 2015-16, and 10.2% for 2017-18. Progress against these targets will

be provided on an annual basis following publication of the Digest of United 
Kingdom Energy Statistics in July each year. 


 

4.5 Government is already working to gather a broad range evidence on 

renewables through market intelligence, commissioned studies, and for national 
energy statistics. In areas where the market is changing or expanding, we are 
also seeking to expand our evidence base. DECC will gather data on 
renewable heat developments, as well as renewable electricity, to develop our 
understanding of the project pipeline in this growing market.  


 

4.6 Alongside this we will continue to monitor the impacts of the barriers to 

deployment, and will review the progress of delivering the programme of 
actions set out above in Chapter 3. Continued engagement with the market will 
also enable Government to anticipate future deployment risks, innovation 
opportunities and changes to technology costs, and to reprioritise our delivery 
actions as appropriate. 


 

4.7 Official reports to the European Commission, along with future iterations of the 

Roadmap, will be accessible online. This will enable stakeholders and the 
public to access the most up-to-date evidence and analysis on renewables. For 
example, it will include deployment information from the annual Digest of UK 
Energy Statistics, DECC’s quarterly Energy Trends publications, and the 
Renewable Energy Planning Database.  

Conclusion 

4.8 Through implementation of the actions outlined in this Roadmap we intend to 
tackle the key barriers which are impeding the deployment of renewables in the 
UK. To ensure that we are focusing activity and resources effectively we will 
analyse the impact of these actions and monitor deployment progress across 
the sectors. 


 

4.9 Technology costs, innovation breakthroughs and barriers to deployment will 

change over time. DECC will continue to work with market participants and 
others from across the renewables sector to better understand the potential of 
renewable energy through to 2020, and to identify and react to new constraints 
and opportunities as they emerge. With each edition of the Roadmap we will be 
one step further along the path to delivering our target for 2020.

	UK Renewable Energy  Roadmap
	 Renewable electricity has become well established. The existing pipeline of large-scale projects is strong, and allowing for historic dropout rates, has the potential to put us on track to deliver a total of 29 GW of operational capacity by 2020;
	 Onshore wind: Provide long term certainty for investors through electricity market reform and a managed transition from the Renewables Obligation. Reform the planning system to ensure it supports economic growth and gives communities a greater stake in development. Co-fund the development of technical solutions to overcome windfarm interference with aviation radar and broker roll-out plans, including through a new Memorandum of Understanding with industry. Upgrade onshore transmission capacity and ensure that developers secure timely and cost-effective access to the network and put in place a process to monitor delivery;
	 Biomass electricity: Publish a UK Bioenergy Strategy later this year articulating a clear vision for the growth of sustainable biomass energy in the UK. Apply the Strategy in deciding, a year ahead of the original timetable, new Renewables Obligation bands to come into force from April 2013, and link payments to sustainability standards from April 2013. Focus on measures to support long-term waste fuel supplies including through possible landfill restrictions on waste wood. Work with regulators to introduce cost effective fuel monitoring and sampling systems and ensure that environmental legislation does not have an unintended impact on renewable energy plant;
