The UK government’s view on geo-engineering 


 

What is geo-engineering? 


  

Geo-engineering (sometimes called “climate engineering”) proposals to counter 

climate change are attracting growing attention, yet the scientific evidence base to 

inform a rational debate on their potential merits or risks is currently limited.  

Geo-engineering is the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth’s natural 

systems to counteract human-caused climate change. A range of different 

geoengineering techniques has been proposed, in two broad categories: 

• those to remove greenhouse gases directly from the atmosphere (greenhouse 

gas removal technologies, or GGRs, such as afforestation, bioenergy with 

carbon capture and storage, direct air capture and storage, marine 

fertilisation); 

• those to reflect some of the Sun’s energy that reaches Earth back into space 

(solar radiation management, or SRM, such as brightening of marine clouds, 

injection of aerosols into the stratosphere). While these would be likely to 

reduce the Earth’s temperature, they would not reverse ocean acidification 

(unlike GGRs). 

The priority is, and must be, to tackle the root cause of climate change by reducing 

emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities and adapting to those impacts 

that are unavoidable. Mitigation of climate change, by reducing emissions and 

protecting natural carbon sinks, remains the main focus of our efforts to increase our 

chances of avoiding dangerous climate change.  


 

Research, development and deployment  

The Climate Change Act 2008 requires the UK to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

by at least 80 per cent on 1990 levels by 2050. As the UK approaches 2050, its 

remaining emissions will likely be in the sectors where it is the most difficult to cut 

them.  

Greenhouse Gas Removal 

GGR technologies are likely to have an important role to play in offsetting these 

emissions. Further, the Paris Agreement includes an aim of achieving net zero global 

greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the century. As indicated in the 


  

Clean Growth Strategy1, the Government believes the UK will need to legislate for a 

net zero emissions target at an appropriate point in the future. The CCC has made it 

clear that GGRs globally and in the UK will be central to realising this aim under the 

Paris Agreement2. We will seek the Committee on Climate Change’s (CCC) advice 

on the implications of the Paris Agreement for the UK’s long-term targets after the 

release, in October 2018, of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C by the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)3  

The Government has no current policies to deploy specific GGR technologies 

beyond existing commitments to plant 11 million trees in England4, to increase the 

amount of UK timber used in construction, and to restore peatland567. 

Any further deployment must be informed by thorough understanding of the costs, 
feasibility, environmental and societal impacts. Such understanding is currently 
limited so we are taking active steps to strengthen our understanding of these 
technologies and, where appropriate, move forward with deployment; for example 
we have been working with the Research Councils, who launched a new £8.6 million 
GGR research programme in April 20178. As indicated in the Clean Growth Strategy, 
we will develop our strategic  approach to GGR technologies in light of this work. 


 

Solar Radiation Management 


 

The government is not deploying SRM, and has no plans to do so.  

The UK Government has commissioned research into the effects of SRM on climate, 

which showed that SRM deployment would produce changes in rainfall patterns and 

amounts. This would be likely to lead to ”winners” and “losers”, with some regions 

suffering detrimental impacts91011.  

The UK Government is not commissioning further research into SRM, but the World 
Climate Research Programme’s (WCRP’s) Geoengineering Model Intercomparison

4 The UK Government also has a longer term aspiration to increase woodland cover to 12% by 2060, 
as set out in the 25 Year Plan for the Environment. There are no current plans to further deploy 
GGRs.

Project (GeoMIP), is investigating the effects which SRM would have on the 
climate12. 


   


Regulation  


 

We would expect any deployment of GGRs to comply with local, national and 

international regulation and guidance. Some forms of geo-engineering are already 

regulated. For instance, in England, large-scale afforestation is covered by 

Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations. In addition, work has been 

undertaken to examine how existing instruments could apply:  


 

• The Government has supported the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 
in their review of existing regulatory instruments.  Following consideration of 
this review, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD adopted a 
decision in 2016 noting that more research is needed. The COP also recalled 
their previous decision in 2010 which invites Parties to take a precautionary 
approach on any geo-engineering activities that may affect biodiversity until 
there is an adequate scientific basis to justify such activities, with the 
exception of small-scale, controlled scientific research studies.  


 

• The Government has also contributed to work under the London Protocol on 
the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, to 
adapt the instrument to meet this new challenge. This has resulted in adoption 
by Parties to the London Protocol, in October 2013, of an amendment to 
regulate ocean fertilisation activities and, potentially, other forms of marine 
geo-engineering. The UK was the first country to ratify the amendment, in 
2016.
