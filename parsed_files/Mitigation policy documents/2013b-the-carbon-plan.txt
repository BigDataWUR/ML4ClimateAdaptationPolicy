 and in the way we travel. this means 
better public transport, reducing emissions 
from petrol and diesel engines and moving 
towards alternative technologies such as 
electric vehicles.
Becoming a low carbon economy will be one 
of the greatest changes our country has ever 
known. But it is a change for the better, for our 
economy, our society, and for the planet. this 
Carbon Plan shows how, together, we can make 
it happen.
David Cameron 
Prime Minister
nick Clegg 
Deputy Prime Minister
Chris Huhne 
secretary of state for 
energy and Climate Change
this Carbon Plan sets out a vision of a changed 
Britain, powered by cleaner energy used more 
efficiently in our homes and businesses, with 
more secure energy supplies and more stable 
energy prices, and benefiting from the jobs and 
growth that a low carbon economy will bring.
But it does more than that. It shows exactly 
how we will deliver that vision and play our part 
in the global effort to tackle climate change 
and build a green economy through specific, 
practical action across government, month by 
month and department by department. We 
want the public to tell us where we can be even 
more ambitious, and hold us to account on 
delivering what we say, when we say. together, 
we can make our vision a reality.
Doing this means change across the whole 
economy, but most critically and fundamentally 
in three areas, namely:

 in the way we generate our electricity, 
where we must see a dramatic shift away 
from fossil fuels and towards low carbon 
alternatives – renewable energy, new 
unsubsidised nuclear power and fossil fuel 
power stations fitted with Carbon Capture 
and storage;

 in the way we heat our homes and 
businesses, where a step change is needed 
in how well our homes are insulated and in 
the use of low carbon energy alternatives, 
such as heat pumps;

and West Antarctic ice sheets, leading to 
major sea level rise, or the release of large 
natural stores of methane from oceans or 
melting permafrost, which could cause 
further warming. the UK Met office’s 
Hadley Centre has produced an interactive 
map1 outlining some of the impacts 
that may occur if the global average 
temperature rises by 4°C (7°F) above the 
pre-industrial climate average.

3 government’s approach to avoiding the 
risk of dangerous climate change has at its 
heart the Climate Change Act 2008, which 
requires government to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions by:

 cutting emissions by at least 34% by 2020 
and 80% by 2050 – below the 1990 
baseline;

 setting and meeting five-yearly carbon 
budgets for the UK during that period; and

1 Climate change is one of the greatest 
threats to both UK and global security 
and prosperity. there is an overwhelming 
scientific consensus that climate change 
is happening, and that it is very likely to 
be primarily the result of human activity. 
there is now almost 40% more carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere than there was 
before the industrial revolution, a level not 
experienced for at least the last 800,000 
years. Consequently, the global average 
temperature continues to rise, and  
2000–09 was the warmest decade on 
record since at least the 1850s (see 
figure 
1).

2 Without action to curb emissions, there is 
a very high risk of global warming reaching 
well beyond 2°C relative to pre-industrial 
times. such unmitigated global warming 
would increase the risk of accelerated or 
irreversible changes in the climate system, 
such as initiating melting of the greenland

 Be fair: there will inevitably be costs to 
government, business and individuals in 
making such a significant change. these 
costs will be lower than the alternative 
of dealing with the cost of unmitigated 
climate change and offset by maximising 
the growth opportunities from a low 
carbon transition, but they will still be 
real, and the government is committed to 
preventing any unnecessary burden and to 
sharing the costs fairly.

 Act sustainably: this Carbon Plan 
is underpinned by the government’s 
continued commitment to sustainable 
development, to be open and transparent 
in its operations and to look to the long 
term to tackle economic, environmental 
and social challenges. the government 
is committed to taking a sustainable 
approach to decarbonising our economy 
and finding the right balance between 
environmental benefits, impacts, costs and 
the need for a secure low carbon energy 
supply. the government will give further 
details of its approach in the natural 
environment White Paper.

 Be outward-looking: Climate change 
is a global problem and requires a global 
solution. Action in the UK and our support 
for practical action overseas will help 
demonstrate our commitment to other 
countries, and will stand alongside our 
commitment to negotiating for a global 
deal on climate change.

 requiring that those carbon budgets be 
set three budget periods ahead – so that 
it is always clear what the UK’s emissions 
will be for the next 15 years – and setting 
the trajectory towards the 2020 and 2050 
targets.

4 this is a firm, long-term and legally binding 
framework that requires government to 
ensure that the transition to a low carbon 
economy really happens. But it leaves 
important choices about how we make 
that change.
Our principles

5 Within the overarching framework set by 
the Climate Change Act, the government 
is committed to a number of principles 
that will guide our approach:

 Take a whole-government approach: 
tackling climate change and demonstrating 
leadership through action is the 
responsibility of every part of government, 
cental and local, and the wider public sector.

 Be facilitative: government’s role should 
be to set the legal and market frameworks 
and to provide the information to enable 
businesses, households, local areas and 
communities to play their part.

 Be inclusive: our efforts to cut 
greenhouse gas emissions should not be 
forced through top down by government. 
We should make this change by enthusing 
our whole society, in line with our 
commitment to localism.

Chapter 1: the challenge of climate change – our approach
alone. to cope with this, we will need a 
new generation of secure, low carbon 
electricity, powered by a mix of renewable 
energy, new nuclear power and fossil fuel 
power stations fitted with new Carbon 
Capture and storage (CCs) technology 
capable of locking away carbon dioxide 
emissions, and reusing as far as possible 
the waste heat that is generated. Much 
of this change is likely to need to happen 
between now and 2030, requiring in 
excess of £110 billion of investment in 
generation, transmission and distribution 
over the next decade.3

 Heat for our homes and businesses: 
Almost half of the UK’s greenhouse gas 
emissions are from the energy used to 
generate heat,4 with the vast majority 
of our homes still relying on fossil fuel 
powered gas boilers and with much of our 
building stock still poorly insulated and 
inefficient. there is a huge opportunity 
here, not only to cut greenhouse gas 
emissions and emissions of harmful 
pollutants, but also for households and 
businesses to save money, with the most 
significant and cost effective opportunities 
likely to come from better insulation and 
from replacing inefficient heating systems. 
We need to ensure that the homes and 
buildings being built now and in the future 
are as energy efficient as possible, and the 
government is committed to introducing 
ambitious energy efficiency standards for 
Our approach in the UK

6 In 2010 the government published 2050 
Pathways Analysis, which looked in detail 
at the changes the UK would have to 
make in order to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions by at least 80% by 
 
the report showed many different ways 
in which this could be done, but most 
fundamentally it showed that it can 
be done.

7 While there are many possible pathways, 
there are some common themes that 
emerge across the various solutions 
explored in the report. these themes, 
combined with wider evidence, suggest 
that while every sector of our economy 
will need to change between now and 
2050, there are three areas – which are 
together responsible for 80% of the UK’s 
greenhouse gas emissions2 – in which 
change is most critical:

 Generating our electricity: Under many 
scenarios explored in 2050 Pathways 
Analysis, demand for electricity is likely 
to double by 2050 compared to today. 
Changes in other sectors are likely to 
mean greater reliance on electricity for 
applications such as transport and heating, 
pushing up demand. At the same time, 
our existing power plants are coming 
to the end of their lives, with around a 
quarter set to close within the next decade

homes, businesses and travel, the impact 
of other sectors of the economy will 
become ever more important. emissions 
from sectors such as agriculture, waste 
and industrial processes are likely to grow 
steadily as a proportion of the UK’s total 
emissions and it will be essential that 
appropriate policy action is taken across 
all of those sectors.

10 the government believes that this  
change can be enabled, among other 
things, by reform to make the tax system 
greener, including by increasing the 
proportion of tax revenue accounted  
for by environmental taxes.

11 there are significant business opportunities 
associated with the transition to a low 
carbon economy, and our carbon budgets 
provide a clear and credible long-term 
framework to incentivise private sector 
investment in energy saving and low carbon 
technologies. Being more efficient with 
energy means reducing waste, reducing 
costs and being more competitive.  
In 2009 the UK share of the low carbon and 
environmental goods and services sector 
was worth £112 billion, with over 900,000 
people employed in the low carbon sector 
and its supply chain; by 2015, it is expected 
that there will be at least 1 million.5

12 the government will also need to ensure 
that we stimulate innovation and develop 
the necessary skills and technologies in 
new homes and buildings. In the short 
term, this means ensuring that all fossil fuel 
boilers are as efficient as possible, but we 
also need to move towards lower carbon 
alternatives such as air and ground source 
heat pumps and consider decentralised 
options like Combined Heat and Power and 
district heating.

 Powering our cars and vehicles: 
transport is a major contributor to the 
UK’s energy demand and greenhouse 
gas emissions, as well as other polluting 
emissions, with the majority of those 
emissions coming from the oil-based fuels 
we rely on for road transport. We can 
all play a part in changing this by taking 
advantage of public transport and looking 
at innovative alternatives to travel such 
as video conferencing for some business 
meetings. A big impact will come from 
improvements to conventional engine 
technology and from developing vehicle 
technologies that allow us to use low 
carbon fuels to power our road vehicles. 
A step change is needed over the coming 
decades to move away from oil-based fuels 
and towards ultra-low carbon alternatives 
such as electric vehicles.

8 the greatest and most urgent change is 
needed in these three areas – but it is far 
from the only change needed.

9 As we act to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions from our use of electricity, 
5 In 2008/09 the global market for low carbon and environmental goods and services was worth £
2 trillion and is forecast to grow by approximately 
4% per year over the next five years. Refer to Innovas, for the Department for Business, Innovation and skills (2010) Low Carbon and Environmental 
Goods and Services: An Industry Analysis – Update for 2008/09,

Chapter 1: the challenge of climate change – our approach

14 this Carbon Plan sets out four key priorities 
for UK action internationally:

 Developing leadership within the 
European Union: As the largest single 
market in the world, the eU has the 
opportunity to demonstrate to the rest of 
the world that a low carbon economy is 
firmly in our economic and energy security 
interests. Within the eU we will support 
the rapid transition to a low carbon 
european economy, including through the 
development of a robust eU low carbon 
roadmap to 2050 (and the steps we will 
take to 2020) and by encouraging the eU 
to adopt a 30% emissions reduction target 
for 
 externally we will play our part 
in ensuring that the eU takes a leading 
role in international negotiations, through 
its relations with other major economies, 
and by delivering on its obligations 
to provide climate finance to support 
developing countries. 

 Building the case for global ambition 
with key countries and international 
institutions: globally, we need to work 
to ensure that all major countries see the 
move to low carbon economies as essential 
to their long-term security and prosperity. 
Developed countries need to take the 
lead in taking action to cut emissions and 
supporting others to act: we will maintain 
our strong relationship with the Us, Japan 
and other developed countries on these 
issues, where we face shared challenges 
around how to decarbonise our economies 
in ways that support long-term growth and 
prosperity. the government is committed 
the UK. this will require significant public 
and private sector investment in all stages 
of the innovation process, from research, 
through development and demonstration, 
to deployment. the government directly 
supports innovation and works through 
the Research Councils, technology strategy 
Board, energy technologies Institute and 
Carbon trust. the government will ensure 
that the low carbon business opportunities of 
the future are underpinned by our strengths 
in science, research and innovation.
Our approach internationally

13 the UK has a direct national interest in 
ensuring that the world tackles climate 
change, given the potentially devastating 
impact that unchecked climate change 
could have in this country. the UK 
accounts for just 2% of global emissions, 
so our long-term security and prosperity 
depends on effective international action. 
the UK’s approach will focus on deploying 
UK and eU economic, technical, diplomatic 
and development assets to influence 
global political and economic conditions 
to secure action from other countries to 
limit greenhouse gas emissions; helping 
developing countries to build the climate 
resilience of their economies and move 
towards low carbon growth in the future; 
and working for a comprehensive global 
climate change agreement. In taking this 
forward, the government is committed to 
working closely with partners in the private 
sector, non-governmental organisations 
and civil society.

10
Chapter 1: the challenge of climate change – our approachChapter 1: the challenge of climate change – our approach

 Ensuring progress within the 
international climate change 
negotiations: the Un Climate Change 
Conference in Cancun restored 
international confidence, following 
the disappointments of the previous 
conference in Copenhagen, in the 
effectiveness of multilateral action under 
the Un Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UnFCCC). We will continue to 
work towards a comprehensive, legally 
binding international climate change 
agreement under the UnFCCC, seeking 
further progress by the next major  
Un Climate Change Conference in  
Durban, south Africa, in late 
  
We will continue to support work to build 
consensus and trust between developed 
and developing countries on how to move 
forward in the negotiations.
Cross-government management of the 
delivery of emissions reductions

15 All of the above represents a huge 
programme of change that will transform 
our economy and our way of life. But it 
also represents a practical task which the 
government is committed to managing 
effectively and transparently. the right way 
to do this is through well planned and 
measurable action right across the UK, 
including action taken by the Devolved 
Administrations in northern Ireland, 
scotland and Wales. this Carbon Plan 
shows how every part of government will 
work together to deliver that action. It sets 
out, department by department, specific 
to strengthening bilateral partnerships with 
major emerging economies, including India, 
China, Brazil and south Africa, and we will 
use these relationships to develop further 
our collaboration on low carbon growth. 
We will also work to support the wide 
range of developing countries that want 
to be more ambitious in tackling climate 
change. And we will continue to seek 
effective international action through the 
g8, g20 and other international fora.

 Supporting the development of low 
carbon, climate resilient economies: 
the UK will support developing countries 
to take practical action to shift to low 
carbon, climate resilient development 
paths, including through scaling up the 
deployment of low carbon technologies 
and building confidence in long-term 
private investment in low carbon. 
Recognising the growing importance 
and urgency of taking practical action to 
tackle climate change, the UK has made 
significant commitments to support other 
countries, establishing a £
9 billion 
International Climate Fund (ICF). the 
ICF will reduce international poverty 
by supporting low carbon growth and 
development, adaptation to climate 
change, and action to tackle deforestation 
while protecting biodiversity. And the UK 
will work to share expertise and new ideas 
with other countries about how to further 
develop carbon markets and open up 
low carbon investment opportunities for 
private finance.

Chapter 1: the challenge of climate change – our approach
tracking progress and risks to delivery and 
act as a benchmark for what we expect 
policies to deliver.

 Departments are held accountable for 
delivery of their carbon reduction policies 
and/or activities that support or enable 
carbon reduction through a framework of 
regular monitoring and reporting against 
their actions and indicators of progress.

 the government will report publicly on 
progress against the actions in the Carbon 
Plan on a quarterly basis and will provide 
more detailed updates by sector via its 
response to annual progress reports by the 
Committee on Climate Change (in october 
each year).

 this approach to carbon budget 
management primarily applies to BIs, 
DClg, Defra, DeCC, Dft and HMt, which 
lead or have an impact on the majority 
of policies. the wider actions of all 
departments are constantly kept under 
review, with particular attention to new 
government initiatives that may have a 
knock-on effect on emissions, including 
those that may lead to an increase in 
emissions.

 this ‘draft’ Carbon Plan is intended to set 
out and seek input into the format and 
content of the final ‘live’ Carbon Plan. 
A ‘live’ Carbon Plan will be published in 
october 2011 (to take into account the 
fourth carbon budget covering the period 
milestones in every sector of the economy 
for the action that the government will 
take, alongside the key actions that each 
department will take to support the UK’s 
work internationally. the government is 
committed to meeting those milestones 
and will publish quarterly online updates to 
show whether it has done so and, if not, 
what corrective action it will take.6

16 As set out in this Carbon Plan, reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions in the UK 
and thus meeting legally binding carbon 
budgets under the Climate Change Act 
is a cross-government responsibility. 
A number of departments across Whitehall 
lead on the majority of policies that 
reduce emissions, but all departments 
are involved as a minimum through the 
reduction of emissions from their own 
buildings and estate.

17 to ensure that the sum of the policies 
and enabling actions to reduce emissions 
are sufficiently ambitious and successfully 
implemented, a robust carbon budget 
management framework has been put in 
place to hold departments to account for 
their actions. the approach comprises the 
following stages:

 through collaborative discussion and 
analysis, the preferred policies and 
measures to meet carbon budgets are 
agreed across government. the resulting 
information on emissions savings estimates 
by policy provide a tool for assisting in

system. Rising future demand means 
that we need to replace our ageing 
electricity infrastructure with low carbon 
alternatives – a combination of renewable 
energy, new nuclear power and fossil 
fuel power stations fitted with Carbon 
Capture and storage (CCs) technology. 
this represents a vast challenge, with 
an estimated £110 billion9 or more of 
investment likely to be needed by 2020 in 
electricity generation infrastructure and in 
the transmission and distribution network 
needed to transport that electricity to end 
users. Around 30% of our electricity is 
likely to need to come from renewables 
alone by 2020 in order to meet our legally 
binding eU target to source 15% of the 
UK’s energy from renewable sources by 
that date.10
Reforming the electricity market

4 the current electricity market structure has 
served us well in maintaining secure energy 
supplies since the 1990s, encouraging 
competition and supporting some of the 
lowest electricity prices in the eU. But 
the changing nature of the UK’s energy 
and climate change challenges means 
we now need a different structure. the 
reality is that the estimated £110 billion 
of investment needed in electricity 
infrastructure represents roughly double 
the rate of capital investment seen over 
the last decade, and it is likely that new 

1 secure supplies of electricity are something 
we take for granted, lighting our homes, 
powering our appliances and keeping 
our workplaces running. But the majority 
of that electricity is generated through 
burning fossil fuels, meaning that energy 
supply is responsible for 35% of the UK’s 
greenhouse gas emissions – more than any 
other sector of the economy.8

2 At the same time, there are big changes on 
the horizon. Demand for electricity is likely 
to rise due to our efforts to cut greenhouse 
gases elsewhere in the economy, for 
example as we use electricity much more 
for powering transport and heating our 
homes. And alongside this, around a 
quarter of the UK’s current electricity-
generating power plants are set to close 
over the next decade due to age or stricter 
environmental regulations.

3 this means we cannot continue as 
we are. the UK needs clean, safe and 
affordable energy to heat our homes and 
power our businesses, and we need to 
identify a sustainable route for making 
the transition to low carbon energy. 
electricity power plants of all types take 
years to plan and build, and many have 
a working lifespan of 40 years or longer, 
making it essential that we plan for the 
long term. the government is committed 
to finding a sustainable pathway for 
the decarbonisation of our electricity

attractive still. A ‘contract for difference’ 
model for low carbon generation is 
proposed (guaranteeing a certain price 
to generators for their electricity, and 
contracting for the government to meet 
the difference between this and the current 
market price), as this should control costs 
for consumers, provide stable returns 
for investors and maintain the market 
incentives to generate when electricity 
demand is high. However, because of 
complex design and implementation issues, 
the government is also consulting on a 
premium feed-in tariff (a fixed payment 
which generators receive on top of the 
market price) as a credible alternative.

 Capacity payments: these are targeted 
payments to encourage security of supply 
through the construction of flexible reserve 
plants or demand reduction measures 
(for instance, contracting with companies 
to reduce energy usage at times of high 
demand – so-called ‘negawatts’). Capacity 
payments will ensure that an adequate 
safety cushion of capacity remains as the 
amount of intermittent and inflexible low 
carbon generation increases.

 Emissions Performance Standard: 
A back-stop to limit how much carbon 
the most carbon-intensive coal-fired 
power stations can emit. An emissions 
Performance standard will reinforce the 
existing requirement that no new coal 
plant is built without demonstrating CCs 
technology.
entrants to the market will need to be 
encouraged in order for this to be possible. 
gas generation remains the lowest cost 
and lowest risk investment under the 
current market structure, and change will 
be needed to bring forward investment 
in renewables, nuclear and CCs at the 
right speed and scale and to enable a cost 
effective roll-out of these technologies.

5 to address these challenges, the 
government has published a consultation 
on electricity Market Reform,11 presenting 
a review of the way that the market 
framework affects investment decisions 
and proposing a new framework to 
incentivise investment in low carbon 
generation and the maintenance of secure 
supplies in a cost effective way while 
also keeping energy bills affordable. that 
consultation set out four main proposals 
to reform the market in order to achieve 
these aims:

 Carbon price support: greater long-
term certainty is needed around the 
additional cost of running polluting plant. 
supporting the carbon price will encourage 
investment in low carbon technologies. 
By strengthening the carbon price for 
electricity generators, it will increase the 
cost of fossil fuel generation, making lower 
carbon power more attractive.

 Feed-in tariffs: long-term contracts 
would provide more certainty on the 
revenues from low carbon generation 
and make clean energy investment more

participants (in relevant sectors, defined 
by intensity of energy use, and including 
the vast majority of electricity generation), 
with that cap decreasing over time. 
Companies and organisations covered by 
the system are given or sold allowances 
that permit emissions up to the total set by 
the cap, and are able to buy and sell these 
allowances, effectively creating a market 
price for carbon and encouraging emission 
reductions to be made in the most cost 
effective way.

10 In addition, the UK government has 
set in place a system of three major 
financial incentives to support sustainable 
renewable energy deployment:

 the Renewables obligation, under which 
electricity suppliers are required to source a 
proportion of their energy from renewable 
generation;12

 feed-in tariffs, which provide a financial 
incentive for the generation of small-scale 
(less than 5MW) low carbon electricity; and

 the Renewable Heat Incentive, which will 
support the generation of renewable heat 
and which will start to be implemented  
in 


11 We will also need low carbon electricity 
from a new generation of civil nuclear 
power, built without public subsidy. the 
government will support this by creating 
an enabling framework to facilitate new 
nuclear development from 
 this 

6 Following that consultation, the 
government will publish a White Paper 
later in 2011 setting out proposals to 
reform the electricity market.
Towards a new energy infrastructure

7 the reforms to the electricity market set 
out above will be essential to transforming 
the UK’s electricity infrastructure and 
bringing forward the investment needed 
in low carbon generation. Ahead of this 
reform, the government has already set in 
place a range of measures to encourage 
investment in renewables, nuclear power 
and CCs.

8 UK trade & Investment (UKtI) has 
developed a framework for inward 
investment in energy focusing on key low 
carbon technologies which offer the best 
short and medium-term opportunities for 
foreign direct investment into the UK. For 
key sectors such as offshore wind, onshore 
wind, nuclear, microgeneration in biomass 
and photovoltaics, and Carbon Capture 
and storage, prospectuses have been 
set up and UKtI‘s network is targeting 
companies operating in these sectors with 
a view to them investing in the UK.

9 the most substantial single measure driving 
decarbonisation in the power sector is the 
eU emissions trading system (eU ets). this 
is an eU-wide ‘cap and trade’ scheme, 
under which a single total cap is set for the 
greenhouse gas emissions of all scheme 
12 the future of the Renewables obligation and how it relates to the proposed system of feed-in-tariffs is being considered as part of the electricity 
Market Reform project.

Chapter 2: secure, sustainable low carbon energy
Reform of the electricity grid

14 Delivering the level of change needed in 
the UK’s energy generation and use will 
require major changes to the way in which 
we transport energy around the country. 
the electricity grid allows us to transport 
power from where it is generated to the 
end user, via a transmission network that 
moves electricity over long distances at 
high voltages and a number of lower 
voltage regional distribution networks that 
feed electricity into homes and businesses. 
It is a fundamental asset and vital to the 
UK’s economic and national security. 

15 the government is working to ensure that 
the right framework is in place for the 
investment that will be needed in our grid 
infrastructure, including work to connect 
new forms of electricity generation, so that 
the grid has the capacity and capability 
to deal with energy demand and with 
changes to the way we generate energy 
(such as more widely geographically 
distributed generation) as new and more 
diverse sources of energy are connected.

16 the government is facilitating this 
transformation by:

 ensuring that the planning regime for 
major national infrastructure, including 
the national Policy statements that will 
be submitted to Parliament for approval 
by May 2011, is designed both to support 
the development of electricity networks 
and to minimise unnecessary barriers and 
potential delays in connecting up the new 
energy infrastructure;
will include setting the arrangements for 
assessment by the nuclear regulators of the 
safety, security and environmental impact 
of new nuclear reactors, putting in place 
regulation to ensure that operators meet 
the full costs of decommissioning and their 
full share of waste management costs, and 
submitting the national Policy statement 
for new nuclear power to Parliament for 
approval by May 


12 lastly, if the UK’s energy supplies are to 
remain secure and affordable, fossil fuels 
will remain part of its energy mix for 
some time to come, with a role to play in 
balancing the intermittency of high levels 
of renewable electricity generation.

13 In the longer term, for fossil fuels to 
continue to form a substantial part of 
the energy mix we will need commercial-
scale deployment of CCs technology. CCs 
has the potential to capture up to 90% 
of the emissions from coal and gas-fired 
electricity generation and lock the carbon 
dioxide away securely in underground 
geological formations. the government 
has already announced up to £1 billion of 
funding for the UK’s first commercial-scale 
demonstration of this new technology 
on coal. the government will complete 
a process to identify further CCs projects 
to be supported by public investment by 
May 2012, and has made subsequent 
demonstrations eligible to CCs projects 
on gas.

20
Chapter 2: secure, sustainable low carbon energyChapter 2: secure, sustainable low carbon energy

 creating a new ‘connect and manage’ 
regime, which was announced in July 2010 
to accelerate grid connection time. All 
arrangements to ensure effective operation 
and communication are in place;

 ensuring that the competitive offshore 
transmission regime maximises the 
opportunity for strategic transmission 
infrastructure development; and

 paving the way towards a ‘smarter’ 
electricity grid in the UK, which will 
increase the efficiency and reliability of 
the network, enable flexible demand 
management and the use of electric 
vehicles, and support integration of more 
local and wind-powered generation.
Planning reform

17 Reform of the planning system will be 
vital for delivery of infrastructure. For 
major infrastructure, the government 
proposes to replace the Infrastructure 
Planning Commission (IPC) with a Major 
Infrastructure Planning Unit within the 
Planning Inspectorate, restoring the 
responsibility for taking decisions to 
government Ministers while retaining the 
IPC’s fast-track process for examining major 
infrastructure projects.

18 For projects that fall below the threshold 
for major infrastructure,13 the localism 
Bill introduced a number of measures to 
reform the planning system and put power 
13 set out in the Planning Act 

back into the hands of communities. 
the government has also announced its 
intention to publish a national Planning 
Policy Framework, which will set out the 
national economic, environmental and 
social priorities for planning, including on 
climate change. the important role played 
by planning in meeting the challenge of 
climate change will be reflected in the 
Framework and we will make it clear that 
planning has a big part to play – both 
in cutting emissions and in adaptation.
Alongside these planning reforms, the 
government has committed to allowing 
communities that host renewable energy 
projects to keep the additional business 
rates they generate. this will be taken 
forward through the local government 
Resource Review.

3 other measures will also play an important 
part, such as helping people understand 
more about the source and impact of the 
energy they are using and the emissions it 
creates, engaging and enabling people and 
communities to make choices to use less 
energy. But it is the two areas outlined in 
paragraph 
2 that are the most significant – 
and the most urgent.

4 there will be no one-size-fits-all solution 
to reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
from our homes. For instance, while most 
homes in the UK rely on gas boilers for 
their heating and hot water, there are 
also around 
8 million homes that are 
not connected to the gas grid and that 
use other options, such as heating oil or 
electric heaters.16 While a rural farmhouse 
may benefit from improved loft insulation 
and installation of a ground source heat 
pump, a modern tower block might be 
able to reduce its emissions more cost 
effectively by fitting cavity wall insulation 
throughout and being connected to a form 
of network heating for all the flats in the 
block, even where this still relies on (more 
efficient) fossil fuel supply. or, better still, 
the tower block could be connected to a 
source of heat from a local power station or 
a large source of renewable heat such as a 
biomass boiler. the government’s aim is to 
set the right legal and financial framework 
and provide the right information to help 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 

1 the UK’s 26 million homes are responsible 
for 14% of its greenhouse gas emissions.14 
the majority of these emissions are as a 
result of burning fossil fuels. In particular, 
gas use dominates domestic sector 
energy consumption, making up 81% of 
consumption for heat purposes and 68% 
of overall domestic consumption.15

2 In seeking to reduce these emissions, the 
government will focus its effort on two key 
priorities, which together are likely to have 
the greatest impact:

 increasing the energy efficiency of our 
housing stock. this includes ensuring that 
new-build houses are as energy efficient 
as possible, with a move to zero carbon 
homes from 2016 (and zero carbon 
non-domestic buildings from 2019) but 
we will make the most difference most 
quickly through efforts to retrofit existing 
housing, prioritising the most cost effective 
measures such as cavity wall and loft 
insulation; and

 helping people make the choice to move 
away from a reliance on fossil fuel-based 
space and water heating and towards low 
carbon alternatives. these include air and 
ground source heat pumps at domestic 
level, and Combined Heat and Power 
or a form of network heating in those 
communities where it makes sense.

consumers more information about steps 
they can take to improve the sustainability 
of their home more broadly.
Making the move to low carbon heat

8 the way in which we heat and cool our 
homes will need to change significantly 
if we are to meet our carbon reduction 
and renewables targets. We will need a 
gradual shift away from fossil fuel-based 
options such as heating oil and gas boilers 
and towards low carbon alternatives such 
as air and ground source heat pumps, 
solar thermal heating, biomass boilers and 
use of ‘wasted’ heat from industrial and 
commercial processes.

9 to help support this change, the 
government is setting in place a 
Renewable Heat Incentive scheme, to 
provide support to homes and businesses 
choosing to install renewable heat 
technologies. this scheme will act to 
drive down the emissions that result from 
heating our homes and will also play an 
important part in meeting the UK’s eU 
target to source 15% of its energy from 
renewable sources by 

Building new homes to high environmental 
standards

10 Around a third of homes that will be 
in use by 2050 are yet to be built. the 
government is committed to ensuring 
that new-build homes are zero carbon 
our homes, and help people benefit from 
reduced energy bills as a result.
More efficient homes – saving energy 
through the Green Deal

5 From 2012, the government will set  
in place the green Deal, which will  
enable households (and businesses – see  
chapter 4) to invest, at no upfront cost, in 
home energy efficiency improvements that 
are expected to pay for themselves through 
energy bill savings.

6 A new energy Company obligation will 
support delivery at scale of cost effective 
measures that require additional assistance 
to be taken up through the green Deal, 
such as solid wall insulation. this will drive 
down costs but also promote investment 
and innovation within the energy efficiency 
industry. Additionally the energy Company 
obligation will provide extra support for 
low income vulnerable households. this 
will enable people who might face more 
challenges to take advantage of the 
green Deal.

7 to ensure that consumers can feel 
confident in the firms that will install these 
efficiency measures, the government 
will establish an installer certification 
framework, ensuring that installers operate 
to high technical and customer service 
standards. We will also ensure that the 
products installed meet specified standards 
and that advice services are in place to give

from 2016 and do not add extra carbon 
dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, 
while ensuring that the costs of building 
new homes do not prevent suitable and 
sustainable development.

11 the government is committed to 
successive improvements in national 
new-build standards through changes 
to Part l of the Building Regulations 
2010 (conservation of fuel and power). 
In october 2010 the new regulations 
introduced a 25% improvement on 2006 
carbon emissions standards. the next 
review will look at strengthening standards 
again in 2013 in line with developing policy 
for zero carbon, and consider provisions 
for the existing stock in the light of the 
government’s emerging policies on retrofit, 
including the green Deal.

12 the government wants to support and 
enable communities in their wish to adopt 
higher environmental standards for new 
homes including through:

 ensuring that there are robust sustainability 
standards for local authorities to use if 
they want to set higher standards than 
those in the national regulations in their 
local plans. For example, the Code for 
sustainable Homes provides standards for 
the sustainable design and construction 
of new homes (including water efficiency) 
that meet or exceed those set out in the 
Building Regulations 2010; and

and a wish to adopt higher standards of 
sustainability and design.

1: Vanguard Areas
The Big Society is already happening in many 
local communities – for example, in the 
‘vanguard’ areas announced by the Prime 
Minister in July 
 The Department for 
Communities and Local Government is working 
with the vanguard areas to help them overcome 
the barriers they experience. This includes 
barriers to taking action to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, including with the London 
Borough of Sutton on sustainable energy, and 
with Eden Valley, Cumbria on the development 
of a groundbreaking community hydro scheme 
and anaerobic digestion.
Changing consumer behaviour

13 the government understands that 
reducing energy use and emissions in the 
residential sector will only be possible 
by developing solutions that address the 
barriers to action – whether through the 
provision of better information or removing 
the hassle associated with action – 
enabling people to take decisions that save 
money and reduce emissions.

programme, involving the installation of 
around 50 million smart gas and electricity 
meters,17 will provide consumers with 
real-time information about energy use, 
enabling them to monitor and manage their

energy consumption, and can pave the way 
for a transformation in the way in which 
energy is supplied and used. Consumers will 
receive accurate bills; switching between 
suppliers will be smoother and faster; and 
improvements in the delivery of energy 
efficiency advice, including the purchasing 
and end use of energy efficient products, 
will be supported.

15 energy suppliers will be able to offer a 
wider range of services and tariffs to 
manage their customer relationships better. 
smart meters will also be an important step 
towards the development of a smart grid, 
delivering improved network efficiency 
and responsiveness. the government 
will also examine the operation of the 
energy performance of buildings regimes 
and make resulting enhancements to the 
energy Performance Certificate (ePC) so 
that they become the basis for advising 
households on green Deal measures and

sector (e.g. addressing the differences 
between domestic and commercial energy 
supply contracts) to ensure that businesses 
can benefit from the business element of 
the green Deal, which will enable them 
to access the benefits of savings on their 
energy bills without the need to provide 
upfront finance (see chapter 3).

4 the government will also ensure that 
energy efficiency savings are achieved in 
large organisations that participate in the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment energy 
efficiency scheme, through using the 
financial and reputational drivers of the 
scheme. the energy reporting required 
by the scheme ensures that organisations 
are aware of their energy use, and that 
senior management is responsible for this 
reporting. the government is currently 
discussing options with participants 
for simplifying the scheme, to deliver 
improvements most effectively with 
minimal burden on business.

5 More effort is also needed to reduce the 
emissions of new business buildings. 
Around 40% of the non-domestic floor 
space that will exist in 2050 is yet to be 
built.20 the government is committed 
to reducing carbon emissions from new 
buildings through successive changes to 
the Building Regulations and to enabling 
new non-domestic buildings to be zero 
carbon from 
 the next review of 

1 Around 17% of the UK’s greenhouse gas 
emissions come from our businesses and 
industrial processes.18 these emissions 
are produced in different ways, including 
from industrial processes or from heating – 
and cooling – office buildings. In addition 
to heat-related emissions, greenhouse 
gas emissions are produced by chemical 
reactions in industrial processes, or from 
leaks of fluorinated gases from equipment 
like refrigerators and air conditioners. 
Making these processes greener and more 
efficient will be an important part of the 
move towards a low carbon future.
Helping businesses increase their energy 
efficiency

2 the energy used in our businesses and 
in industrial processes will always be 
an important part of our economy. the 
government is committed to improving 
energy efficiency to help deliver the UK’s 
climate objectives at the lowest cost. 
the government will focus its support 
where there is a need to help business 
overcome barriers to investing in energy 
and carbon saving. By improving resource 
efficiency, using less energy and water and 
minimising waste, UK businesses could 
save around £
4 billion per year – 
9% of 
UK gross operating surplus (profit).19

energy efficiency for business. Advanced 
metering with some smart functionality is 
already used in the non-domestic sector, 
particularly at larger sites. Under the 
government’s smart metering proposals, 
new metering will be installed at the 
remaining

standards in support of developing policy 
for zero carbon and will consider provisions 
for the existing stock in the light of the 
government’s emerging policies on retrofit, 
including the green Deal.
Helping businesses reduce their emissions

6 government will work with business to 
reduce emissions through mechanisms 
including:

 the eU emissions trading system (see 
chapter 2), which will be responsible for 
the greatest reduction in emissions from 
both the power and business sectors;

 the eU regulatory framework on 
fluorinated greenhouse gases (F gases), 
which has been fully implemented in 
the UK;21

9 the government will continue to 
encourage companies to measure and 
report their greenhouse gas emissions, 
as there is evidence showing the benefits 
to companies and to other stakeholders 
from public disclosure of emissions data.24 
the Climate Change Act 2008 requires 
the government to make regulations by 
April 2012 requiring company directors’ 
reports to include information about 
greenhouse gas emissions (or to explain 
to Parliament why such regulations have 
not been made). the government will be 
announcing a way forward on this matter 
in the first quarter of 


10 Investors and business will be the engine 
of the transition and it is important that 
they appreciate and capitalise on the 
opportunities and challenges that this 
presents. this year the government 
will publish a roadmap to a green 
economy, which will seek to create more 
transparency, certainty and longevity for 
business and investors to give them the 
confidence that they need to drive the 
transition. Innovation will be important in 
a range of low carbon sectors, including 
hydrogen energy, wave and tidal, nuclear, 
automotive and Ultra-low emission 
vehicles, and the built environment. 
government supports innovation and 
particularly low carbon innovation 
through sponsorship of the UK Research 
Councils, technology strategy Board and 
energy technologies Institute. through 
these investments we are ensuring that 
businesses have a strong underpinning of 
science, research and innovation to develop 
the low carbon business opportunities of 
the future.

11 Direct emissions from industrial processes 
contribute 2% to the UK’s greenhouse 
gas emissions.25 As part of the energy 
Intensive Industries strategy, the 
government is conducting in-depth 
analysis with key energy intensive sectors 
into the cumulative effect of various energy 
and climate change measures and the 
abatement potential in the short, medium 
and long term, as well as the barriers 
that businesses face in realising this. the 
strategy will use this evidence, together 
with a review of the existing policy 
measures that impact on these sectors, 
to develop policy recommendations for 
maximising abatement potential while 
ensuring future competitiveness.

GrowHow is the UK’s only manufacturer of 
ammonium nitrate fertiliser which, as the 
main synthetic fertiliser currently used in 
England, is essential to maintaining levels of 
food production. The production of ammonia 
and nitric acid, the constituents of fertilizer, 
is both energy and carbon intensive and, as a 
result, GrowHow is the UK’s largest industrial 
consumer of natural gas. GrowHow is investing 
£35 million, voluntarily and ahead of legal 
obligations, to increase energy efficiency and 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GrowHow 
already supplies surplus carbon dioxide to a 
greenhouse complex next to their Billingham 
site) in the run-up to 2013, including a current 
£9 million project on nitrous oxide abatement.

12 the government is establishing a green 
Investment Bank to provide funding for 
investments in infrastructure projects 
that support economic growth and our 
environmental objectives in areas where 
private sector investment is currently 
constrained. the government will publish 
further details on its proposals for the 
governance arrangements and design of 
the business and operating model of the 
new institution by May 


13 the green Investment Bank will tackle 
risk that the market currently cannot 
adequately finance and will look to 
catalyse further private sector investment 
and facilitate the entrance of new types 
of investor into green infrastructure, so 
that the impact on the finance gap for low 
carbon investment is many times the scale 
of the public contribution.

14 the green Investment Bank will be 
capitalised initially with £1 billion of 
funding allocated from departmental 
budgets together with additional 
significant proceeds from the sale of 
government-owned assets, subject 
to a final design that meets the tests 
of effectiveness, affordability and

Supporting new low emission vehicle 
technologies

4 the government is convinced that 
the introduction of Ulevs will play an 
important role in decarbonising transport. 
the spending Review confirmed provision 
of over £400 million to support the 
development of the Ulevs market.  
A consumer incentive (the Plug-in Car 
grant) will be available to facilitate the 
purchase of Ulevs while the market is  
in its infancy. this will help to create a 
more level playing field between new  
and existing vehicle technologies, until 
market scale drives purchase costs of 
newer technologies down to a more 
competitive level.

1 transport is an engine for economic 
growth, moving goods and workers 
around the country, allowing people to 
access employment, services, friends 
and family, leisure activities and their 
wider communities. But it is also a major 
source of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Domestic transport accounts for 22% of 
UK greenhouse gas emissions.26 the vast 
majority of this came from road transport, 
which accounts for 20% of UK greenhouse 
gas emissions.

2 If we are to tackle greenhouse gas 
emissions and other harmful emissions 
from transport, it is therefore imperative 
that we develop and improve vehicle 
technologies that allow us to use 
less fuel or lower carbon fuels. the 
government will work hard to support 
both the development and introduction 
of new vehicle and fuel technologies 
such as electric and other Ultra-low 
emission vehicles (Ulevs), and ongoing 
improvements in the fuel efficiency of all 
modes of transport.

3 this must be the greatest priority, but other 
changes will play an important part as 
well. the government will work to support 
sustainable travel choices and alternatives 
to travel, and to promote sustainable 
distribution of goods and sustainable 
low carbon approaches to other forms 
of transport, including rail, aviation 
and shipping.

representing road transport.

with industry in research and development 
to help UK-based businesses maximise the 
economic benefits associated with a rapidly 
developing Ulev market. As part of this 
funding, the government has contributed 
to a total award of £24 million for six 
projects to help develop the UK’s low 
emission vehicle capability. the projects 
include the development of new engines 
for plug-in hybrid cars to improve vehicle 
performance, and materials that reduce 
vehicle weight.

7 A new wave of low carbon public transport 
will be encouraged by the green Bus Fund, 
which will incentivise bus operators and 
local authorities to buy new hybrid and 
electric vehicles, with around 170 vehicles 
expected to be purchased by March 


8 the encouragement of a growing 
Ulev market in the UK can provide 
manufacturers and the associated supply 
chain with the incentives to invest in the 
high-tech manufacturing technologies 
demanded by the market, including range 
extender engines, batteries for automotive 
use (e.g. nissan’s planned battery plant in 
sunderland), electric motors, mechanical 
storage (flywheels) and fuel cells.

9 However, if we are to see large-scale  
take-up of electric vehicles as a major form 
of road transport, developing charging 
infrastructure will also be vital and the 
government has committed to mandating 
a national recharging network. By June 
2011, the government will produce a 
strategy setting out how it will promote 
Box 
1: Supporting the take-up of ultra-low 
emission cars
The Government announced the first nine 
electric and ultra-low emission cars eligible for 
the grant of up to £5,000 from 1 January 2011, 
as well as confirming a total of eight Plugged-
in Places projects around the country. These 
projects have successfully bid for a share of a 
£30 million fund aimed at encouraging a new 
network of electric vehicle recharging points in 
streets, homes and sites such as car parks and 
commercial retail and leisure facilities. The first 
nine cars to become eligible for the grant are: 
the Mitsubishi i-MiEV; the Smart Fortwo electric 
drive; the Peugeot iOn; the Nissan Leaf; the Tata 
Indica Vista; the Citroën CZero; the Vauxhall 
Ampera; the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid; and 
the Chevrolet Volt.
The successful Plugged-in Places consortia are 
based in: the Midlands; Greater Manchester; East 
of England; Scotland; Northern Ireland; London; 
Milton Keynes; and the North East.

5 In addition to the environmental and 
energy security benefits of Ulevs, there 
are opportunities for the continued 
development of the UK’s automotive 
industry. the automotive sector is of 
significant importance to the UK economy, 
supporting research and development, 
technological innovation, skills and a 
supply chain that is a mainstay of the wider 
manufacturing sector.

6 the government has made provision 
of around £80 million to support a 
programme of research and development. 
this includes supporting the technology 
strategy Board’s low Carbon vehicles 
Innovation Platform, which invests jointly

that people have viable, low carbon 
alternatives, including rail.

12 High speed rail could potentially treble 
the maximum capacity on the crowded 
london to Birmingham rail corridor and 
will help to support economic growth and 
a low carbon economy. the government 
believes that high speed rail is best placed 
to provide significant and sustainable 
additional capacity to meet increasing 
demand for travel between the UK’s largest 
and most productive conurbations over the 
next 20–30 years. It would also comprise a 
step-change improvement in journey times 
and connectivity.

13 the government supports a y-shaped 
network, linking london and Birmingham 
(2026), with the Manchester and leeds 
legs following in the mid-2030s. the 
network will include direct links with High 
speed 1 (the line from london st Pancras 
to the Channel tunnel) and Heathrow. 
the government will now consult on this 
strategy before confirming its decisions 
later this year.

14 High speed two (Hs2) ltd’s report29 found 
that, even allowing for the substantial 
additional demand accommodated by Hs2 
on the congested West Coast corridor, 
there would be no significant change to 
overall transport carbon emissions. the 
the provision of nationwide recharging 
infrastructure. grant funding of £30 million 
will support eight towns and cities to roll 
out charging infrastructure at specific sites 
across the UK. this will see up to 8,500 
charging points installed across the UK 
by March 
 the government will 
also work with the eU to ensure the early 
adoption of new common standards for 
charging infrastructure.

10 Alongside supporting the introduction 
of Ulevs in the UK, the government will 
continue to push at eU level for ambitious 
but realistic vehicle emission standards for 
carbon dioxide. In 2009 the eU introduced 
a regulation setting mandatory new car 
carbon dioxide targets, which introduced 
an eU-wide target of 130g/km.27 similar 
regulation is currently being agreed by 
the eU for vans.28 the UK welcomes in 
principle the agreement that has now been 
reached on the new van carbon dioxide 
regulation, which is expected to be ratified 
by the european Parliament and the 
Council in early 

High speed rail and electrification

11 While decarbonising road transport is likely 
to have the most significant greenhouse 
gas impact, and so be our greatest priority 
for change, it will also be important 
27 sales-weighted average emission targets of 130g/km from 2012, with full compliance by 
 this represents an 18% reduction on 2007 levels. 
A further provisional target of an average of 95g/km for all new cars has also been set for 2020, representing a 40% reduction on 2007 levels. the 
european Commission’s review of the 95g/km target for new cars by 2020 is due to be complete by 1 January 

28 this regulation is due for formal ratification by the european Parliament and Council in early 2011 and it appears likely to introduce average targets for 
new vans of 175g/km from 2014, with full compliance in 2017 (a 14% reduction on 2007 levels) and 147g/km by 2020 (a 28% reduction on 2007 
levels).

Chapter 5: towards low carbon transport
Sustainable aviation and shipping

18 over time, as other parts of the economy – 
including road transport – reduce their 
carbon emissions, aviation and shipping are 
likely to become proportionately more 
significant as sources of greenhouse gas 
emissions. the government believes that a 
global deal, rather than national solutions, 
is the most effective way to tackle 
emissions from these sectors given their 
international nature. However, it also 
recognises the value of regional measures 
until a global solution is in place. 
International aviation and shipping 
emissions are not, at present, included 
within the scope of the 2050 reduction 
target required by the Climate Change Act 
2008, but the legislation obliges the 
government to include these emissions 
within the target before the end of 
December 2012, or to explain to 
Parliament why this has not been done.

19 the government will continue its 
preparatory work to include aviation in the 
eU emissions trading system (eU ets) in 

 the aviation eU ets carbon dioxide 
cap has been set so that net aviation 
emissions cannot increase beyond 97% 
of average 2004–06 levels in 2012 or 
beyond 95% of average 2004–06 levels 
from 2013 to 
 growth in aircraft 
emissions above these levels will only be 
possible if operators purchase allowances 
from other sectors within the eU ets or 
the wider market.
wider y-shaped high speed network to the 
north of the country could also provide 
an attractive alternative for many journeys 
that would otherwise be made by 
short-haul aviation.

15 the government supports further 
electrification of the rail network. electric 
trains are cleaner, quieter and more 
reliable than diesels, as well as providing 
more seats. they are also cheaper to 
buy, operate and maintain. By 2016, 
electrification of the lines between london 
and Reading, Didcot, newbury and oxford 
(on the great Western Main line) and of 
those between liverpool, Manchester, 
Preston and Blackpool (in the north West) 
will allow the current diesel trains to be 
replaced with electric trains.

16 the great Western electrification is 
expected to cost up to £600 million, and the 
package of electrification in the north West 
will cost up to £300 million.30 the extent of 
further electrification for intercity services on 
the great Western Main line is dependent 
on the intercity train option chosen. the 
government will continue to consider the 
case for further electrification schemes, 
including on the Midland Main line.

17 Alongside electrification, the government 
will continue to work with the rail industry 
to improve the energy efficiency of new 
and existing trains and the efficiency of the 
railway as a system, for example through 
better traffic management and by reducing 
electrical losses.
30 Figures reflect the capital costs of electrification, which will be funded by network Rail and supported by the government.

Chapter 5: towards low carbon transportChapter 5: towards low carbon transport

20 Internationally, the UK is participating in 
work at a global level to agree a carbon 
dioxide standard for aircraft, and at 
european level the UK is actively involved in 
making air traffic management operations 
more efficient through the single european 
sky programme.

21 the government has cancelled plans 
for a third runway at Heathrow and 
set a commitment to refuse permission 
for additional runways at gatwick and 
stansted. the June 2010 Budget included 
a commitment by HM treasury to explore 
changes to the aviation tax system.

22 the government has made clear 
its intention to create a sustainable 
framework for aviation in the UK, which 
supports economic growth and addresses 
aviation’s environmental impacts. the 
government will issue a scoping document 
in March 2011, setting out the questions 
it is seeking to answer, with a view to 
publishing a draft policy framework for 
consultation in March 2012, followed 
by formal adoption of the framework in 
March 


23 At the same time as pursuing measures 
to constrain emissions from aviation, 
the government will continue to pursue 
global action on shipping through the 
International Maritime organization (IMo), 
which is considering a range of mechanisms 
to reduce international shipping emissions. 
the european Commission also intends 
to bring forward a proposal to address 
international shipping emissions at a 
regional level if no international measure 
has been agreed in the IMo, or through 
the United nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change, by the end of 
 
the UK will work with the Commission and 
other Member states to develop a proposal 
for effective regional action.
Promoting the use of sustainable biofuels

24 Up to now most transport biofuels have 
been developed for use in road transport 
and in the longer term they could also 
play a significant role in reducing carbon 
dixoxide emissions from aviation. to inform 
decision making, the government is 
currently working on a number of projects 
to analyse the availability and costs of 
different sustainable biofuels for use in 
aviation. such information will be needed 
to decide on the most appropriate use, 
across different transport modes, of limited 
resources. the government will consider 
the future potential use of biofuels in 
aviation and road transport in drawing up 
plans, later this year, for reducing carbon 
emissions in the decade beyond 


25 the european Renewable energy Directive 
(ReD) requires the UK to source 10% of 
transport energy from renewable sources 
by 
 Biofuels are expected to form 
the major contribution to this target, 
although electric vehicles and rail will also 
play a part. the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD)

Chapter 5: towards low carbon transport
Changing behaviour to reduce emissions

27 Changes to the way in which transport is 
fuelled are likely to be the most significant 
contributor to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions from transport. But a significant 
impact can also come from changing 
the way we manage our supply chains 
and the way we travel, and from finding 
alternatives to needing to travel at all.

28 the government’s local transport White 
Paper32 promotes sustainable transport 
choices at a local level. For instance, 
funding of £560 million for the local 
sustainable transport Fund will enable 
local bodies to deliver sustainable transport 
solutions that support local economies 
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Projects supported by the fund are likely 
to incorporate a range of sustainable 
transport measures, including public 
transport, walking and cycling. the 
government has also recently announced 
plans to work with industry to encourage 
greater uptake of eco-driving training and 
fuel efficiency measures for bus, coach 
and lorry drivers and the wider freight 
sector, and its intent to review progress 
made through such industry-led measures 
and reconsider the case for government 
intervention in 


29 the government also supports the transfer 
of freight from road to rail and water, 
where it is practical and economically and 
our fuels by 
 the ReD and the FQD 
contain mandatory sustainability criteria for 
biofuels; these include that biofuels must 
deliver greenhouse gas savings of at least 
35% when compared with fossil fuels, and 
that they must not be sourced from areas 
of high biodiversity or from high carbon 
soils (such as rainforests or wetlands). the 
government remains concerned about 
the potential Indirect land Use Change 
(IlUC) impacts of biofuels and has called 
on the european Commission to come 
forward with proposals to address IlUC 
within the ReD and the FQD. the european 
Commission is now undertaking further 
assessment of whether and how to address 
IlUC in european legislation, which will 
conclude by July 


26 the Renewable transport Fuel obligation31 
(RtFo) currently obligates fossil fuel 
suppliers who supply at least 450,000 litres 
a year to supply a specified percentage 
of their fuels for road transport in the UK 
from renewable sources. the RtFo provides 
a mechanism which allows obligated 
suppliers to meet their obligations in the 
most cost effective way, ensuring that the 
UK can meet these targets in a low cost 
manner. the government will shortly be 
consulting on amendments to the RtFo 
to meet the requirements of the ReD and 
the FQD.
31 the RtFo came into effect in April 2008, with an obligation level of 
5% in the first year. For 2010/11 the obligated level is set at 
5%, and this 
increases annually to a level of 5% in 2013/

environmentally sustainable to do so. this 
includes support through grants, such 
as Mode shift Revenue support grants, 
which are provided to rail and water freight 
operators to assist with the operating costs 
of running a rail or water freight service 
where this is more expensive than road and 
where there are environmental benefits to 
be gained. In 2009/10 alone, such support 
enabled over 800,000 lorry journeys 
to be removed from Britain’s roads, 
generating carbon dioxide savings of over 
130,000 tonnes. We recently confirmed 
future budgets for operational grants of 
£20 million for 2011/12 and £19 million for 
2012/
 It is currently the government’s 
intention to provide much the same level of 
funding in 2013/14 and 2014/


30 Modern technology can provide fast and 
effective alternatives to travel, and can 
also provide greater flexibility, resulting 
in a number of benefits to staff and 
businesses – for example improved staff 
motivation, access to a wider staff pool 
and access to a wider job market – as 
well as reduced emissions. Information 
and communications technology 
solutions can substitute the need to 
travel by allowing people to work at 
home, to attend meetings remotely 
through video conferencing or to do their 
shopping online.

Chapter 6: Cutting emissions from waste
this includes closed landfill sites that are 
still giving off methane and looking at the 
role new technologies can play in capturing 
this and converting it to valuable energy.
Box 
1: Local Authority Waste Separation 
Scheme
In 2008, the London Borough of Bromley 
introduced a trial scheme to separately collect 
food waste and increase the frequency of paper 
collection. The final stage of the trial covered 
27,500 properties, with food waste and paper 
collected every week, and residual waste, glass, 
cans and plastics collected every other week. The 
trial showed an 11% reduction in overall waste 
produced and a 45% reduction in residual waste 
being collected (and therefore disposed of to 
landfill). All separately collected biodegradable 
waste was sent for recycling or conversion into 
energy. This represented an increase in kerbside 
recycling from 24% to 52%. The scheme was 
rolled out across the Borough in October 2010 
and Bromley is expecting a household recycling 
rate above 55% as a direct result.

4 the government will continue to increase 
its knowledge of waste emissions, in 
particular quantities of methane generated, 
captured and emitted from landfill sites. 
this will improve the level of certainty 
about the evidence base for the waste 
sector and strengthen the model used to 
calculate the waste contribution to the 
national greenhouse gas inventory.

1 Around 3% of the UK’s total greenhouse 
gas emissions come from waste.33 Around 
89% of these emissions come from 
landfill sites where biodegradable wastes 
decompose to produce methane and 
carbon dioxide gas. our near-term priority 
must be to reduce the amount of waste 
going to landfill in the first place. In the 
longer term, generation of energy from 
waste is likely to become an increasingly 
important source of low carbon energy.
Transition to a ‘zero waste’ economy

2 significant progress has been made 
through instruments such as the landfill 
tax to halve the amount of waste going 
to landfill over the last 10 years. Building 
on this progress, government is currently 
reviewing waste policies in england to put 
us on the path to creating a ‘zero waste’ 
economy: not an economy where no waste 
is produced, but one where nothing is 
actually ‘wasted’ and all resources are fully 
valued – financially and environmentally. 
this will involve reducing the amount of 
waste we produce and finding better use 
for the waste we do produce through 
reuse, recycling and making use of  
a range of technologies such as anaerobic 
digestion (see figure 
1) to produce 
energy from waste.

3 government is also working closely with 
the environment Agency and industry to 
explore ways to increase the amount of 
methane that is captured from landfill sites.

Figure 
1: Anaerobic digestion – producing energy from waste
Harnessing energy from waste

5 For waste that cannot be prevented, 
reused or recycled, energy from waste 
technologies can provide a valuable 
resource through heat, electricity and 
transport fuels. energy can be generated 
from waste through a variety of both 
established and emerging technologies 
such as combustion with Combined 
Heat and Power, anaerobic digestion, 
gasification and pyrolysis.
Anaerobic digestion (AD) is the process whereby 
plant and animal material (biomass) is converted 
into useful products by micro-organisms in the 
absence of air. Biomass is put inside sealed tanks 
and naturally occurring micro-organisms digest 
it, releasing methane that can be used to provide 
clean renewable energy. The material left over 
at the end of the process is rich in nutrients so it 
can be used as fertiliser. It is a proven technology 
and there are a growing number of anaerobic 
digestion plants in the UK processing our waste and 
producing energy. Almost any biomass can be 
processed, including food waste, crop residues, 
slurry and manure. The plants can accept waste 
from our homes, supermarkets, industry and farms, 
meaning less waste goes to landfill.

6 the government will set the future policy 
framework for energy from waste and will 
publish a full anaerobic digestion strategy 
in May 2011 as part of the review of 
waste policies.

2: Sheffield City Centre District Heating Scheme
Sheffield has an award-winning city centre 
district heating scheme34 which delivers low carbon 
heat to over 140 buildings (including offices, 
hospitals, hotels and residential premises) through 
over 45km of underground pipes, providing all 
their heating and hot water needs.  At the heart 
of the scheme is the city’s energy from waste plant 
which treats 225,000 tonnes per year of household 
waste and provides up to 21MW of electricity to 
over 22,600 homes. This enables Sheffield to send 
less than 15% of its waste to landfill, and save over 
21,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year.

its third carbon budget. the Agriculture 
Industry GHG Action Plan: Framework for 
Action36 (February 2010) outlined how 
reductions could be made through more 
resource-efficient practices. As well as 
enabling a reduction in emissions, these 
practices would also improve farmers’ 
competitiveness. Many measures involve 
simple changes in farming practices at 
minimal or no extra cost, such as:

 better use of nutrients, matching the needs 
of the crop;

 improving livestock productivity and 
efficiency; and

 better use of on-farm energy and fuel.

1: Controlled Traffic Farming37
Andrew Manfield grows a mix of cereals, peas, 
oilseed rape and certified seed potatoes on his 
200 hectares in East Yorkshire. Two years ago 
he switched to a Controlled Traffic Farming 
system, which uses GPS technology to create and 
maintain tracks year after year, confining traffic 
in fields to the smallest possible areas, with the 
soil between the tracks being protected. With 
70% of his land now untrafficked, Andrew is 
beginning to reap the financial benefits. He 
is cutting energy costs (savings can be up to 
75%), the soil organic matter and quality has 
visibly increased, and the system is much quicker, 
freeing up time for other work on the farm. He’s 
looking forward to seeing increased yields as the 
system becomes established – a similar system on 
a Lincolnshire farm has seen the winter wheat 
yield increase from 
5 to 4 tonnes per acre.

1 the way in which we use our land has an 
important impact on the UK’s greenhouse 
gas emissions. the agricultural sector is 
responsible for around 8% of the UK’s 
greenhouse gas emissions, most of which 
come from livestock, fertilisers and fuel use 
in farming.35

2 land use and land management also have 
an important impact on carbon balances, 
for example in soils and forests. Alongside 
agriculture, other uses of land such as 
forestry have the potential to make a 
positive difference, absorbing carbon 
dioxide and countering the harmful impact 
of emissions from other sectors.

3 the government is determined that 
agriculture should play its part in 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 
working with farmers and others in 
the food supply chain, as well as other 
interested organisations, to achieve this. 
Internationally, the government will 
continue to support efforts to secure 
adoption of a work programme on 
agriculture under the Un Framework 
Convention on Climate Change.

a delivery plan shortly which will set out 
how it intends to put the Action Plan 
into practice. the government intends to 
review the progress made by 2012, and 
will involve other interested organisations 
in this assessment. to support the 
industry’s efforts, the government is also 
funding a pilot project to trial methods of 
delivering integrated environmental advice 
for farmers (including advice on reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions), with a view to 
subsequent wider delivery by government 
and industry advisers.
Increasing woodland cover and sustainable 
forest management

6 the forestry sector can deliver significant 
greenhouse gas abatement through 
carbon sequestration in new woodlands 
and increased use of timber and wood 
products, both to store carbon and to 
substitute for materials with high fossil fuel 
emissions associated with their production.

7 Forestry policy in england is to be reviewed 
by an independent panel, which will advise 
on the future direction of forestry and 
woodland policy, on the role of the Forestry 
Commission, and on the role of the Public 
Forest estate. the panel will report in 
autumn 2011, and the actions below are 
subject to its findings.

8 government will continue to support 
woodland creation through Rural 
Development Programme funding, and 
the Woodland Carbon task Force (see 
box 
2). High quality UK-based forest 
carbon projects will be promoted through 
implementation of the Woodland Carbon 
Code, while changes to UK greenhouse 
gas Reporting guidelines to recognise the 
contribution of such projects to emissions 
reduction are under consideration. the 
government will publish a revised UK 
Forestry standard supported by new 
Forests and Climate Change guidelines 
to promote ‘carbon management’ in the 
UK’s woodlands.

9 Increased deployment of wood-fired 
heating systems will be stimulated by 
the Renewable Heat Incentive and a 
£10 million Woodland Improvement grant 
will focus on woodfuel preparation for 
harvesting.

10 Internationally, continuing support for 
the Forest law enforcement, governance 
and trade process and chain of custody 
requirements for public procurement 
of timber products, together with the 
development of biomass sustainability 
criteria for renewable energy production, 
will promote sustainable approaches to 
forest management globally, helping to 
reduce emissions from deforestation and 
forest degradation.

The Woodland Carbon Task Force was set up 
by the Forestry Commission, with leading roles 
for landowners, businesses and civil society. It 
aims to enable a step-change in the level of 
woodland creation to help to deliver abatement 
in the land management sector. As well as 
working with the financial sector to develop 
new opportunities for investment in UK-based 
woodland creation, the Task Force will help 
to ensure that the contribution of woodland 
creation to carbon budgets is recognised, and 
develop a spatial framework to help to identify 
where woodland creation will have the 
most benefit.
Improving the science base

11 government continues to carry out 
work to improve the science base 
and to reduce uncertainty levels in 
the agriculture sector: £
6 million is 
being invested, in partnership with the 
Devolved Administrations, to strengthen 
our understanding of on-farm emissions. 
government is also working internationally 
through the global Research Alliance 
to co-ordinate research and exchange 
findings.

12 government will continue to strengthen 
the evidence base on soil carbon, 
including exploring the potential for land 
management and agricultural practices to 
increase permanently the storage of carbon 
in soils as mitigation options. government 
is consulting on a future policy to reduce 
further and eventually phase out the 
horticultural use of peat where there is 
a much stronger existing evidence base, 
and peat extraction activities are already 
captured in the UK’s greenhouse gas 
inventory. Forestry projections will also 
be further developed to better represent 
the variation in approaches to forest 
management and the nature of woodland 
creation across the UK.

1: Emissions data monitoring
Provision of real-time data has enabled some 
innovative approaches to incentivising action 
on energy use, such as a competition between 
government departments’ HQ buildings to 
see which could reduce consumption most in 
October 2010 compared with September. Daily 
updates of the league table were provided 
online, and details of the competition were 
communicated to staff in the reception areas 
of Whitehall buildings alongside energy-saving 
messages and displays of personal pledges from 
staff. Overall the Department for Work and 
Pensions won with a remarkable 22% energy 
saving. In total, departments saved around 
£22,000 on energy bills compared with the 
previous month.
Improving public procurement

5 With an annual public sector spend in 
excess of £236 billion, procurement is a 
powerful lever that can reduce emissions 
and drive innovation. the establishment 
of minimum and best practice product 
specifications for government purchasing 
(government Buying standards) has 
improved the environmental performance 
of priority products, such as construction, 
transport, and information and 
communication technology.

6 Many of these product groups 
have resource and energy efficiency 
requirements above the market average, 
reflecting the government’s commitment 
to leading by example in the goods 
and services that it purchases, and 
sending a strong signal to the market 
for the public sector to help organisations 
to invest in energy efficiency projects 
which pay for themselves in less than 
five years. In addition, the government 
is piloting a series of innovative projects 
through the energy efficiency Whitehall 
competition to demonstrate what can be 
done to cut energy bills and reduce carbon 
emissions. Participating departments are 
installing nine innovative technologies 
in their buildings to push forward the 
understanding of what can be done in 
office space to reduce emissions even 
further, ranging from phase-change ceiling 
tiles that can absorb heat in the day (to 
save on air conditioning) to innovative 
lighting solutions and behaviour change 
programmes to reward and motivate staff 
who reduce their emissions.

4 the government supports the Carbon trust 
to work with the public sector, including 
local authorities, hospitals, universities 
and central government departments, 
helping them to develop business cases 
and identify and deliver stretching carbon 
emission reductions.

2: Sustainable London 2012 Olympic Games
Government is determined that the London 2012 
Olympic and Paralympic Games will be the most 
sustainable Games in modern times. To achieve this 
both the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and 
the London Organising Committee of the Olympic 
Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) have 
sought to:

 design the venues and infrastructure to minimise 
carbon emissions and reduce waste;

 reduce carbon emissions associated with the 
transport of construction materials;

 take practical steps to introduce more 
sustainable technologies, including working 
with industry to identify new technologies or 
to drive the market to develop more sustainable 
solutions; and

 promote behaviour change, through the 
supply chain.
Key examples of this approach in action include 
the following:

 The velodrome has improved energy efficiency 
by 31% (above Part L building requirements 
from 2006) achieved by:
– optimising glazed areas to allow adequate 
daylight;
– thermal mass to moderate the internal 
environment;
– natural ventilation providing the main cooling 
strategy for the building; and
– improved insulation in the external envelope 
and roof.

 For the main stadium, unwanted gas pipes 
were reused in the stadium roof structure, the 
stadium bowl was made during the enabling 
works phase rather than the later construction 
phase, and the ODA worked with the industry 
to identify a concrete mix with 42% less carbon 
than standard for use in venue construction.

 The ODA has also installed renewable energy 
capacity on site, including biomass boilers, small-
scale wind turbines40 and photovoltaic lighting.
The positive lessons and best practice developed 
through the delivery of a ‘low carbon Games’ 
are creating an important knowledge legacy for 
both the construction and event industries, the 
application of which has the potential to achieve 
substantial savings in carbon emissions.

Chapter 8: Reducing emissions in the public sector
Encouraging and supporting local leadership

8 the government is working with the 
local government group41 to develop 
an Action Plan detailing how central 
and local government will facilitate and 
remove barriers to carbon reductions 
at a local level. this includes looking at 
how to enable local authorities to act as 
green Deal providers themselves, alone or 
in partnership with others (see chapters 
3 and 4). government is piloting local 
Carbon Frameworks in nine local authority 
areas. these frameworks are a way of 
helping local authorities to quantify the 
action needed in their area to develop 
and implement stretching negotiated 
and locally owned targets for reducing 
emissions.

9 the government would like to embed 
leadership in carbon management and 
transparency of performance in all public 
services. the government will work in 
partnership with public sector bodies to 
overcome the barriers that can prevent the 
public sector from realising cost effective 
carbon reduction, and build on and share 
best practice from the excellent actions 
that some public sector bodies are already 
taking. For example, United lincolnshire 
Hospitals nHs trust is on track to reduce its 
carbon dioxide emissions by 30% by 2015 
since 2007/08, while saving over £600,000 
on its energy costs by that time.42

4 the government has committed to work to 
secure a common eU position to increase 
its emissions reduction target from 20% 
to 30% by 2020 compared with 1990 
levels. We will share with other Member 
states evidence which shows that the 
costs of greater ambition are manageable 
and can deliver tangible economic and 
environmental benefits, especially when 
compared with a scenario of delayed action.

5 the government will work in europe to 
build support for electric and other low 
carbon vehicles, agreement of eU legislation 
on wholesale energy markets and the 
launch of a new infrastructure investment 
package (with significant investment for low 
carbon infrastructure) as part of the delivery 
of these ambitious plans.

6 through the adoption of the new 
eU energy efficiency Action Plan, the 
government will work to ensure that 
action at the eU level to address barriers to 
energy efficiency effectively supports and 
complements action at a national level. 
In particular, the government will seek 
to encourage the eU to implement a fast 
and ambitious programme of measures 
(regulations and voluntary agreements) 
with dynamic energy efficiency and energy 
labelling standards for all major energy-
related products. these standards will, by 
the end of 2012, cover all domestic and a 
large proportion of industrial products and 
should encourage those which waste the 
most energy to be taken off the shelves.

1 the european Union (eU) has the 
opportunity to demonstrate to others 
the benefits of low carbon growth, and 
to strengthen economic and trading 
relationships with other countries which 
want to collaborate on low carbon 
development. strong eU leadership 
will be crucial in building momentum 
internationally and, by making the 
transition to a low carbon economy, the 
eU can significantly enhance its long-term 
economic and energy security interests.

2 the UK negotiates internationally on 
climate change as part of the eU and 
recognises that europe is stronger in 
the world when it works together. 
the government will work to ensure that 
the eU develops strong common positions 
in the negotiations.
Building an EU low carbon economy

3 the government will work with our 
partners in europe to look for opportunities 
to secure the transition to an eU low 
carbon economy, encouraging greater 
ambition in areas including energy, 
transport, product standards and finance. 
the UK has pressed for a consistent 
and coherent eU low carbon vision for 
2050 through the development of a low 
carbon roadmap to 2050, which presents 
a credible and cost effective emissions 
reduction pathway based on robust 
analysis, to be complemented by an 
energy roadmap to 2050 and a transport 
White Paper.

9 the government will build strong bilateral 
relationships with eU Member states to 
share UK best practice and experience 
in the shift to a low carbon economy. 
through the UK’s overseas network of 
embassies and High Commissions we will 
also support the eU’s efforts to strengthen 
bilateral low carbon co-operation with 
major and emerging economies and 
others, co-ordinating with other Member 
states and sharing best practice, in 
particular on emissions trading and Carbon 
Capture and storage.

7 the government will also support the eU 
to bring forward greater harmonisation of 
product standards.43 the increased use and 
harmonisation of standards would increase 
the trade and use of more sustainable 
products, bringing both economic and 
environmental benefits.

8 to manage the risks of the consequences 
of climate change, the government will 
seek to embed adaptation across eU policy 
areas and instruments.
43 Discrepancies between technology, performance and energy efficiency standards globally act as non-tariff barriers to trade by increasing transaction 
costs and reducing or complicating market access.

4 It is for developed countries to take the 
lead in cutting their own emissions and 
providing support to developing countries 
to take action. Chapter 9 describes how 
the UK is seeking to promote greater 
eU ambition, including through a 30% 
emissions reduction target by 
 But 
we will also work closely with the Us, 
Japan, Australia and other developed 
countries to share expertise on how 
to meet the common challenge of 
decarbonising our economies in ways 
which support long-term growth and 
prosperity. For example, later this year 
the government will be working with UK 
businesses to share with Us counterparts 
their experience of identifying new 
low carbon opportunities. We will also 
welcome a Us Congressional Delegation 
to the UK to debate these issues.

5 the government is committed to 
strengthening bilateral relationships with 
the major emerging economies, which 
have a critical part to play in securing 
action on a scale sufficient to limit global 
temperature increases to 2°C.

6 In 2010, the Prime Minister led major 
UK delegations to both India and China, 
reaching agreements on collaboration 

1 the Cancun Climate Change Conference 
demonstrated that over 190 governments 
around the world accept that man-made 
climate change is a reality and that the 
world should be coming together to 
tackle it. Cancun confirmed the goal 
of seeking to limit global temperature 
increases to 2°C, beyond which the risks 
of dangerous climate change become 
much greater. Many countries are actively 
working to reduce their emissions and 
prepare for the impact of climate change.

2 However, the action which countries have 
so far committed to take is not enough 
to ward off dangerous climate change.44 
It is vital therefore that we persuade our 
international partners to deliver on the 
commitments that they have made and, 
over time, take even more ambitious 
action. the UK needs to make the case 
internationally that it is in countries’ best 
economic and wider security interests 
to move towards low carbon, climate 
resilient growth. A key part of this will 
be demonstrating how we are delivering 
at home, as described earlier in this 
document. But it will also depend on 
how we work with other countries, 
the private sector and civil society to 
demonstrate the global potential of the 
low carbon transition.
Working with other countries

momentum worldwide for low carbon, 
Chapter 10: Building the case for global ambition with key countries and international institutions

with 2°C, depending on how the pledges are implemented. www.unep.org/publications/ebooks/emissionsgapreport/

sizes in actively pursuing the low carbon 
transition.

8 the UK’s work to secure effective action 
from other countries will rely heavily 
on our overseas diplomatic network 
to engage and support a progressive 
dialogue with national and local 
governments around the world. As 
part of this dialogue, the UK will listen 
to and learn from other countries and 
share its own expertise and knowledge, 
including from UK domestic policy making 
and implementation, as a means of 
demonstrating that sustainable growth 
is possible.
Aligning climate and commercial diplomacy

9 enhanced trade in environmental goods 
and services and in low carbon solutions 
can make a significant contribution 
both to tackling climate change and 
to leading economies out of recession. 
More open, flexible economies are 
expected to be better placed to cope 
with climatic shocks and to adapt to 
trend changes in the climate. overall, 
only a global commitment to green 
growth can ensure sustainable increases 
in living standards. Achieving emission 
reductions consistent with limited global 
temperature increases to 2°C will require 
the dissemination and deployment of 
technology at an unprecedented rate, 
for which open markets and trade will 
be vital. the government has recently 
published the trade and Investment 
on low carbon development. We want 
to further strengthen and deepen these 
bilateral relationships. For example, the 
Memorandum of Understanding on low 
carbon co-operation signed with China 
in January this year provides for further 
UK co-operation in a number of China’s 
low carbon provinces and cities over the 
next three years. Working closely with the 
government of India, we will continue to 
support the work of the UK/India Business 
leaders Climate group, which has 
demonstrated the potential of the private 
sector in the UK and India to develop 
innovative ways of tackling climate 
change in a pro-business way. And we will 
seek to strengthen bilateral low carbon 
collaboration with Brazil, south Africa, 
Mexico, Indonesia and other emerging 
economies.

7 We also want to work closely with the 
wide range of developing countries 
with the potential to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of low carbon, climate 
resilient growth and which want to be 
ambitious in tackling climate change. 
Chapter 12 describes how the UK is 
supporting the work of the Cartagena 
Dialogue for Progressive Action, which 
brings together a range of developed and 
developing countries which have the twin 
objectives of seeking an international, 
legally binding climate change agreement 
and of becoming or remaining low 
carbon economies. the Dialogue has 
demonstrated a growing consensus about 
the opportunities for countries of all

Chapter 10: Building the case for global ambition with key countries and international institutions
White Paper45 which sets out our 
support for a strengthened framework 
for international trade, and we will work 
towards mainstreaming low carbon 
growth into all high level trade and 
business engagement. UK businesses have 
low carbon goods, services and solutions 
that are in demand by countries seeking 
a low carbon growth pathway. UK trade 
& Investment will champion businesses in 
these countries and set out support for 
exporters in its new strategy.

10 the government will also gather evidence 
on the contribution that the production 
of goods and services that are consumed 
in the UK is making to carbon emissions 
in other countries. the government 
will develop plans to reduce the most 
significant emissions – for example 
through discussion with UK businesses 
and other interested groups about the 
management of emissions through supply 
chains.
Working through multilateral fora and 
international institutions

11 Alongside our work to engage with other 
countries, the government will play a full 
part in multilateral groups and fora that 
offer further opportunities for countries to 
work together to address climate change 
and drive up the levels of global ambition. 
For example:

 In the g8, the UK will seek to encourage 
developed countries to demonstrate how 
they are delivering the mitigation and 
Fast start climate finance commitments 
that they have already put forward and, 
collectively, maintain their commitment to 
ambitious outcomes in the Un Framework 
Convention on Climate Change 
(UnFCCC) negotiations.

 In the g20, the UK will work with all 
the major economies, building on the 
agreements reached at the seoul summit, 
to work for an ambitious outcome in 
the UnFCCC and take forward the 
recommendations of the Un secretary 
general’s Advisory group on Climate 
Finance (see box 
2). More widely, we 
will support continued efforts towards 
an international green economy. this 
includes progressing g20 commitments to 
phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. 
eliminating fossil fuel subsidies worldwide 
could reduce global greenhouse gas 
emissions by 
8% (2 gigatonnes) 
by 2020 and 10% or more by 
 
Reducing such subsidies would strengthen 
incentives for investment in energy 
efficient technologies and non-fossil 
energy supply. switching these subsidies 
to international climate finance could 
provide around $10 billion per year to 
support clean energy growth.46

3 We therefore need to encourage practical 
action to reduce emissions and move to 
low carbon, climate resilient growth paths 
in a range of countries, using a diverse 
range of interventions. But it is important 
to recognise that developing countries 
will need support and incentives to help 
them to take action on the scale needed 
and to respond to the challenges that 
climate change poses. the government 
will work with key countries to make the 
low carbon, climate resilient transition 
a reality; assist countries with planning 
their low carbon transition and building 
the capacity they have to deliver this; 
demonstrate the potential of innovative 
approaches and new technologies, such 
as Carbon Capture and storage (CCs) and 
offshore wind; and provide support to 
help developing countries to leverage the 
necessary finance to meet or exceed their 
commitments and move to low carbon 
growth paths.
International climate finance

4 over the next four years the UK is 
committing £
9 billion to support 
developing countries in taking action on 
both mitigation and adaptation. How the 
UK deploys the £
9 billion International 
Climate Fund (ICF) announced in the 
2010 spending Review will be at the heart 
of the UK’s strategy to support practical 
action on the ground. It will fully fund 
the remainder of the UK’s £
5 billion 

1 the International energy Agency projects 
that, under business-as-usual scenarios, 
fossil fuel consumption and therefore 
global emissions will continue to grow. oil 
and coal demand in non-oeCD countries 
in particular is projected to grow. Because 
of the rate at which emissions are 
growing in major emerging economies, 
even if developed countries reduced 
their emissions to zero by 2050, it would 
still not be enough to keep average 
global temperature increases below 2°C. 
ensuring that global greenhouse gas 
emissions peak and start to decline by 
2020 will require both deep emission cuts 
by industrialised countries and mitigation 
action from within developing countries.

2 the poorest and most vulnerable 
communities are likely to be hardest hit 
by future climate change and are least 
able to cope. Failure to adapt in good 
time could have serious consequences in 
reversing progress towards, or the ability 
to sustain, the Millennium Development 
goals.48 We have a responsibility to 
support the poorest and most vulnerable 
to adapt to the impacts of climate 
change. the wider national security and 
political instability risks of climate change 
mean that it is in the UK’s interests to 
support and engage in building climate 
resilience regionally and globally. Climate 
change could exacerbate threats to the 
UK’s national security such as overseas 
conflict, migration, disease and food and 
water insecurity.
Chapter 11: supporting the development of low carbon, climate resilient economies

Box 
1: The Capital Markets Climate Initiative
The Capital Markets Climate Initiative was 
launched in 2010 to create a forum where 
governments and the private sector can come 
together to:

 identify tangible and deliverable propositions 
that can help to mobilise private capital on 
a large scale for low carbon investments in 
emerging and developing economies;

 make the case that:
– low carbon growth will create significant 
new business opportunities in developing 
countries;
– private capital to support critical low carbon 
investment is key to sustainable growth and 
development; and
– together, governments and the private 
sector are willing to assist developing 
countries to increase private investment 
that promotes low carbon growth;

 show the facilitative role that financial centres 
can play in mobilising capital on a large scale.

by adapting to climate change, reducing 
their emissions through low carbon 
development and reducing deforestation. 
the ICF will be delivered through a range 
of bilateral and multilateral funding 
mechanisms. the green Climate Fund, 
which was agreed at Cancun and needs 
to be designed during 2011, has the 
potential to be a very important route for 
disbursing climate finance effectively.

5 the UK will continue to use its position  
on the Boards of Multilateral 
Development Banks to encourage them to 
increase their lending in areas important 
for climate change, such as renewable 
energy and forestry.
Reducing the barriers to carbon 
investment overseas

6 We will need to engage other 
governments, the private sector and 
international financial institutions to 
help to provide additional finance and 
to reduce the barriers to low carbon 
investment overseas. the government will 
also work with other countries to support 
the development of the right regulatory, 
legislative and market frameworks 
and identify opportunities to support 
business-to-business collaboration with 
49 Calculations from World Bank (2009) State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2009 and european Climate exchange.

market to help to drive and finance 
emissions reductions internationally. 
the government is also supporting the 
design and implementation of trading 
schemes in countries such as India (UK–
India collaboration on the PAt scheme). 
the aim is to build capacity and share 
expertise to promote emission reductions.

8 the government will also work with 
developing countries to help to design 
and deliver their nationally appropriate 
mitigation actions. Assisting countries 
with identifying the opportunities that  
lie in their economy for green action  
and putting together strong business 
cases should lower the barriers and 
catalyse investment.
Building capacity for low carbon 
development

9 the UK will support developing countries 
to take a more integrated approach 
to their planning, moving away from 
a project-by-project approach towards 
mainstreaming low carbon and climate 
resilience into national plans and planning 
processes. the government is supporting 
the Climate Investment Funds, which are 
trust funds that aim to deliver large-scale 
finance to support at least 45 developing 
countries in realising their plans for low 
carbon, climate resilient development.

10 the government will support work on 
low carbon development plans which 
are important tools for countries to 
identify the most appropriate policy, legal, 
institutional and investment decisions for 
their circumstances. the government is 
working to share the knowledge and skills 
that it and partner organisations have 
accumulated.

11 the government is also supporting the 
Climate and Development Knowledge 
network (CDKn), which links poor 
countries with a network of experts, 
giving easy access to research and policy 
information. the UK is contributing 
£46 million of funding over five years, 
including some Fast start funding prior 
to 
 CDKn has already supported 
the government of Rwanda to develop 
its national strategy on climate change 
and low carbon development. the 
strategy will develop a roadmap for 
future climate resilient and low carbon 
growth in Rwanda. the network and its 
partners are drawing input from a range 
of stakeholders, including ministries, the 
private sector and civil society, to develop 
the strategy.

12 some 17% of global emissions are caused 
by deforestation and 90% of the world’s 
poorest people rely on forests for some 
of their livelihood or derive benefit from 
their resources. the government will 
continue to support activities designed 
to tackle deforestation through active 
participation in multilateral initiatives

3 the Cancun Climate Change Conference 
restored confidence in the capacity of 
the multilateral system to deliver results. 
Moreover, the international community, 
through the outcomes of the meeting 
in Cancun, has begun to build on the 
agreements already reached on a number 
of key issues which will, in time, be 
reflected in a future global deal (see 
box 
1 below).

4 the challenge now is to build on and 
strengthen these agreements. Although 
securing a comprehensive global 
agreement on climate change remains 
difficult, the government is committed 
to building on the momentum achieved 
at Cancun to make as much progress as 
possible in developing the detailed rules 
to shape domestic action around the 
world in the coming years.

5 over the next few months we will be 
working with our partners to develop 
consensus around negotiating priorities 
for Durban. our current assessment is 
that key priorities are likely to include 
the following:

 Ensuring that all countries are well 
placed to deliver on the mitigation 
pledges they have put forward: 
Cancun provides for a series of workshops 
on developed and developing country 
pledges. these will be important 
opportunities to test the assumptions 
which countries are making in their 
domestic plans and to give us a better 
overall picture of where we stand on 
progress towards the 2°C goal.

1 A global, comprehensive, legally binding 
agreement to limit greenhouse gas 
emissions remains the most effective 
and cost efficient way of delivering the 
scale of emissions reductions needed 
to prevent the most serious impacts of 
climate change. An internationally agreed 
framework is also the best way to provide 
the reassurance that countries need 
in order to drive up the collective level 
of ambition; provide greater certainty 
that governments will deliver on their 
commitments both to reduce emissions 
and to provide climate finance; build 
private sector confidence to make long-
term low carbon investments; and build a 
collective picture of progress in reducing 
global emissions. International agreement 
on the scale and nature of support 
for adaptation is a vital part of such a 
global deal.
Making progress through the UNFCCC

2 the government is committed to working 
through the United nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change 
(UnFCCC) to make progress towards 
a legally binding global agreement to 
reduce emissions consistent with the goal 
of limiting global temperature increases 
to 2°C, and to provide financial support 
to developing countries for mitigation and 
adaptation. In doing so, the government 
will continue to build on the existing 
body of rules on mitigation, reporting 
and accounting which have already 
been agreed through the international 
negotiating process.
Chapter 12: ensuring progress within international climate negotiations

76
Chapter 12: ensuring progress within international climate negotiationsChapter 12: ensuring progress within international climate negotiations

 Developing the detail of how 
measurement, reporting and 
verification of countries’ mitigation 
targets and actions will be 
undertaken: We will look to develop 
the guidelines and procedures which 
will enhance transparency and build 
confidence that countries are delivering 
on their commitments. A key priority will 
be to develop the detailed arrangements 
for the review of developed country 
actions, and international consultation 
and analysis for developing countries.

 Further international action to tackle 
deforestation: We will look to secure a 
methodological approach to ReDD+ and 
ongoing high level ambition on finance 
and action.

 Ensuring that accounting rules are 
developed which underpin the 
environmental integrity of the actions 
countries are taking: For example, we 
will want to work with other countries 
to develop effective rules governing the 
treatment of surplus Assigned Amount 
Units, and in respect of land use, land-use 
change and forestry.

 Putting in place the detailed design 
arrangements to support developing 
countries in taking action: the 
government is keen to see good progress 
in 2011 on the detailed design of the 
green Fund, with recommendations for 
consideration at CoP 
 We will also 
Box 
1: The outcome of the UN Climate 
Change Conference (COP 16/CMP 6)50 
Cancun agreed a substantial package of 
decisions, at the very top of UK expectations. 
Although it will still be challenging to reach 
a truly global and comprehensive climate 
agreement, in Cancun, real progress was made 
on issues important for both developed and 
developing countries. Parties:

 agreed for the first time within the UN that 
emissions should peak as soon as possible and 
that we should limit temperature increases 
to 2°C;

 anchored emissions reduction pledges from 
the Copenhagen Accord into the UN system so 
they can be properly assessed in light of the 
2°C objective;

 agreed a system of measurement, reporting 
and verifying emissions so we can see how 
countries are living up to their promises;

 established the Green Climate Fund and 
will start to work on its detailed design so 
it can help developing countries to move 
to a low carbon economy and adapt to 
climate impacts;

 agreed to reduce emissions from 
deforestation, the ground rules for delivering 
this and for monitoring progress;

 agreed upon new mechanisms to help 
developing countries to access low carbon 
technology, and adapt to climate change; and

 built an Adaptation Framework and 
established the Adaptation Committee, as 
well as a process to look at the issue of loss 
and damage.

work to ensure the effective operation 
of the technology mechanism and 
adaptation committee agreed at Cancun.

 New market mechanisms: We will 
pursue agreement within the UnFCCC 
on the establishment of new market 
mechanisms to support cost effective 
emissions reductions. this will be an 
important tool for securing enhanced 
ambition globally in future years.

6 the government welcomes the 
agreement reached at Cancun to establish 
a Review from 2013 to report by 2015 
on international progress towards the 
2°C goal; the adequacy of that goal, 
taking into account the latest science; 
and the effectiveness of the international 
architecture to support global action. the 
UK will work closely with our partners to 
develop consensus about the scope of the 
Review, including its potential to underpin 
further ambition in future years.

7 A key issue at the next Un Climate 
Change Conference at Durban will 
be around the legal form of future 
international agreements to tackle 
climate change. the eU has signalled 
its willingness to consider a second 
commitment period under the Kyoto 
Protocol in the context of a wider global 
framework engaging all major economies.

8 the government will work closely with 
the government of south Africa and 
others to make as much progress as 
possible on each of these issues  
at Durban.

9 In addition, as part of the wider drive to 
create the conditions necessary to support 
a global deal, the government will 
continue to reinforce the need for action 
and encourage convergence on a range 
of issues to support the formal UnFCCC 
negotiations. We will continue to be 
an active participant in the Cartagena 
Dialogue for Progressive Action, working 
with a range of countries that want to be 
ambitious on climate change and building 
trust between developed and developing 
countries on a range of issues in the 
negotiations. this work demonstrated its 
value in the role that participant countries 
played in building consensus necessary 
to secure a positive outcome at Cancun.

10 Also, the government will continue 
to engage actively in multilateral fora, 
including the g8 and the g20 (see 
chapter 10) as well as the International 
Civil Aviation organization (ICAo), the 
International Maritime organization 
(IMo), the Major economies Forum 
and the global Research Alliance on 
Agricultural greenhouse gases, to secure 
international action which complements 
progress within the UnFCCC.

78
Chapter 12: ensuring progress within international climate negotiations
Supporting others to participate

11 With over 190 countries involved in 
the formal Un negotiations, often with 
divergent interests, reaching political 
consensus on a global deal is challenging.

12 An effective global deal will only 
be achieved if all countries can fully 
participate in the negotiations. the 
government will establish an Advocacy 
Fund, which will support the very poorest 
countries to take part in international 
negotiations by providing access to legal, 
technical and logistical support.
Box 
2: The High Level Advisory Group on 
Climate Change Financing
The UN Secretary General established the 
High Level Advisory Group on Climate 
Change Financing (AGF) in February 2010 to 
consider how we can meet the goal we set in 
Copenhagen of mobilising, by 2020, $100 billion 
a year of public and private finance to assist 
poorer countries with the climate challenge. 
The Group’s report, published in October 2010, 
concluded that the goal was challenging but 
feasible. Now that the AGF has reported, we 
are committed to identifying ways in which we 
can work with others to take this work forward. 
The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate 
Change was a member of this group.

emissions. this has recently been agreed 
by the northern Ireland executive.
