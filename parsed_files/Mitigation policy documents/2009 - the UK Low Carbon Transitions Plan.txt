Transition Plan




1. Protecting the public from  
immediate risk 

Climate change is already happening in 
the UK - the ten hottest years on record 
have all been since 1990. The Government 
has more than doubled spending on 
flood protection since 1997, developed a 
heat wave plan in the NHS and is helping 
communities affected by coastal erosion. 

2. Preparing for the future 

Whatever is done to reduce emissions 
in the future, past emissions mean that 
some climate change is already inevitable. 
The UK Climate Projections will be used 
to help plan for a future with a changing 
climate. Factoring climate risk into 
decision making means, for example, 
changing the way we build our houses 
and infrastructure, managing water better 
and adjusting farming practices.  

3. Limiting the severity  
of future climate change 
through a new international 
climate agreement

To limit global temperature increases to 
no more than two degrees and avoid the 
most dangerous effects of climate change, 
the Government is leading international 
efforts to achieve a new international 
climate agreement at Copenhagen in 
December. The deal needs to ensure 
global emissions start to fall within the 
next decade and be at least 50% below 
1990 levels by 2050.   

4. Building a low carbon UK

To play our part in reducing global 
emissions, Britain needs to become a 
low carbon country. The 2008 Climate 
Change Act made Britain the first country 
in the world to set legally binding ‘carbon 
budgets’, aiming to cut UK emissions by 
34% by 2020 and at least 80% by 2050 
through investment in energy efficiency 
and clean energy technologies such as 
renewables, nuclear and carbon capture 
and storage.   

This White Paper sets out the UK’s 
transition plan for building a low carbon 
UK: cutting emissions, maintaining secure 
energy supplies, maximising economic 
opportunities and protecting the most 
vulnerable.

5. Supporting individuals, 
communities and businesses  
to play their part

Everyone has a role to play in tackling 
climate change, from reducing their own 
emissions to planning for adaptation. 
Building on our ‘Act on CO2’ information 
campaign, the Government is providing 
a range of support for individuals, 
communities and businesses, including 
a major programme of financial help for 
home insulation and energy efficiency.

Five point plan
The UK Government has a five point plan  
to tackle climate change.

 Foreword 

The transition to a low-carbon economy will be one of the defining 
issues of the 21st century. This plan sets out a route-map for the  
UK’s transition from here to 2020.

With the discipline of carbon budgets, legally binding limits on 
emissions, we plan to drive change in every area: the way we 
generate energy, the way we heat our homes and workplaces  
and the way we travel.

In Britain, as our own reserves in the North Sea decline, we have 
a choice: replace them with ever-increasing imports, be subject to 
price fluctuations and disturbances in the world market and stick with 
high carbon; or make the necessary transition to low carbon, right for 
climate change, energy security and jobs.

The transition gives us the chance to lead the clean industries of the 
future. In demonstrating the technology to capture carbon dioxide and 
lock it away, for example, we can lay the pipes and the infrastructure 
for new, sustainable industrial hubs, and we gain the engineering 
knowledge to win contracts installing it in other countries. 

Across business, we can build up the skills to be more resource-
efficient. Like the internet, saving carbon can become part of how 
business is done: every financial officer knowing their savings and 
liabilities from carbon, every builder having the skills to build in a way 
which saves energy.

There will be costs to the transition. But they are far outweighed 
by the costs if we didn’t act and faced the expense of adapting and 
coping with dangerous climate change. The task for government is 
to minimise the costs of the low carbon path and spread them fairly. 
That’s why we are committed to drive forward energy efficiency, 
ensure tough regulation and provide extra support for the most 
vulnerable.

The transition will show that Britain, while not the biggest country 
in the world or the largest polluter, can lead in preventing the worst 
effects of climate change. 

Foreword by  
Secretary of State




 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The new predictions from the Met Office and other scientists, the 
most detailed yet, show that the impacts of climate change are not 
just an issue for other countries and future generations, but an urgent 
issue for Britain.

Making the transition will take strategic action by government and 
a comprehensive plan. This is that plan. It shows sector-by-sector 
what savings can be achieved and how every department across 
government will take responsibility. 

But the changes cannot be done by government alone. There has been 
good progress – Britain has already cut 21% of emissions since 1990 
but the move to carbon budgets signals a change of pace, and the 
scale of the task is enormous. 

So alongside the country’s low carbon transition plan, every business, 
every community will need to be involved. Together we can create a 
more secure, more prosperous low carbon Britain and a world which 
is sustainable for future generations.

4 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

This White Paper sets out the UK’s first ever 
comprehensive low carbon transition plan to 
2020. This plan will deliver emission cuts of 
18% on 2008 levels by 2020 (and over a one 
third reduction on 1990 levels).

Key steps include:

For the first time, all major UK Government 
departments have been allocated their  

own carbon budget and must produce their 
own plan.

Getting 40% of our electricity from low 

carbon sources by 2020 with policies to:

Produce around 30% of our electricity 

from renewables by 2020 by substantially 
increasing the requirement for electricity 
suppliers to sell renewable electricity. 

Fund up to four demonstrations of 

capturing and storing emissions from  

coal power stations. 

Facilitate the building of new nuclear  
power stations.

Clarifying that Ofgem, in its job to protect 
consumers, both current and future, should 
help tackle climate change and ensure 

security of supply.

Making homes greener by:

Channelling about £3.2 billion to help 

households become more energy efficient 

by increasing the current programme by 20% 
between 2008 and 2011 and then extending 
it to the end of 2012.

Rolling out smart meters in every home by 
the end of 2020.

Piloting “pay as you save” ways to help 

people make their whole house greener – 
the savings made on energy bills will be used 
to repay the upfront costs.

Introducing clean energy cash-back 

schemes so that people and businesses will 
be paid if they use low carbon sources to 
generate heat or electricity.

Opening a competition for 15 towns, 

cities and villages to be at the forefront of 
pioneering green innovation. 

Helping the most vulnerable by:

Creating mandated social price support 
at the earliest opportunity with increased 
resources compared to the current voluntary 
system. The Government is minded to 
focus new resources particularly on older 
pensioners on the lowest incomes. 

Piloting a community-based approach to 

delivering green homes in low income 

areas, helping around 90,000 homes. 

Increasing the level of Warm Front grants 

so most eligible applicants can receive their 
energy saving measures without having to 
contribute payment themselves.

Helping make the UK a centre of green 

industry by supporting the development and 
use of clean technologies, including up to £120 
million investment in offshore wind and an 

additional £60 million to cement the UK’s 

position as a global leader in marine energy.

Transforming transport by cutting average 

carbon dioxide emissions from new cars 

across the EU by 40% on 2007 levels, 
supporting the largest demonstration project in 
the world for new electric cars, and sourcing 
10% of UK transport energy from sustainable 
renewable sources by 2020.

The first ever formal framework for tackling 

emissions from farming. 

Producing a longer term roadmap for the 
transition to a low carbon UK for the period 
2020 to 2050 by next spring and a vision for a 
smart grid. 

Setting out the Government’s assessment 

of the outlook for energy security.

Summary




 Executive summary 5

This White Paper sets out the UK’s 
transition plan for becoming a low 
carbon country: cutting emissions, 
maintaining secure energy 
supplies, maximising economic 
opportunities, and protecting the 
most vulnerable.

The challenge 
If the world continues emitting greenhouse 
gases like carbon dioxide at today’s levels 
then average global temperatures could rise 
by up to 6°C by the end of this century. This 
is enough to make extreme weather events 
like floods and drought more frequent and 
increase global instability, conflict, public 
health-related deaths and migration of 
people to levels beyond any of our recent 
experience. Heat waves, droughts, and 
floods would affect the UK too. 

To avoid the most dangerous impacts of 
climate change, average global temperatures 
must rise no more than 2°C, and that means 
global emissions must start falling before 
2020 and then fall to at least 50% below 
1990 levels by 2050.

The UK is calling for an ambitious global 
agreement at UN talks in Copenhagen 
in December 2009. The Government’s 
approach to this deal is set out in The Road to 
Copenhagen published in June 2009.

To encourage action, the EU, which 
represents the UK in these UN talks, has 
promised to cut its emissions to 20% below 
1990 levels by 2020, and by 30% if other 
countries play their part. The UK will make an 
above average contribution to meeting these, 
reflecting our relatively high income.

The EU has also created the world’s largest 
emissions trading scheme, which could form 
the basis of a global system to cut emissions 

and help fund emissions cuts in developing 
countries. And it is exemplifying the kinds 
of further targeted action that is needed by 
supporting renewable energy, testing new 
technologies and setting standards to cut 
emissions from cars and other products.

Driving the transition
We all need to play our part in making these 
changes. If we get it right, we will have a 
better quality of life, improved long-term 
economic health, new business opportunities 
in a fast-growing global sector, and, by 
reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, greater 
security of future energy supplies. 

But the transition is not without its 
challenges. We will need to drive major 
changes to the way we use and supply 
our energy and in doing so it is critical that 
our supplies continue to be safe, secure 
and reliable. We need new investment in 
low carbon infrastructure and to manage 
the risks associated with our increasing 

Changes in our climate mean that two out of every  
three people on Earth could experience water  
shortages by 2025




6 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

dependence on energy imports at a time 
when competition for global energy supplies 
is intensifying. Over time, energy costs will 
rise, so the Government will be vigilant in 
ensuring affordable prices and helping the 
most vulnerable.

The UK has made good progress so far. 
Emissions have already fallen 21% below 
1990 levels, nearly double what was 
promised at Kyoto, and over 800,000 people 
are employed in low carbon businesses. But 
there is more to do.

Dynamic, competitive markets, a strategic 
role for Government, and active communities 
will be needed to bring about the transition to 
low carbon.

To drive this transition, the Government 

has put in place the world’s first ever 

legally binding target to cut emissions 

80% by 2050 and a set of five-year “carbon 

budgets” to 2022 to keep the UK on track. 

This White Paper for the first time sets out 

how these budgets will be met – so that by 
2020 UK emissions will be 18% below 2008 
levels and over one third below 1990 levels. 
This will mean emissions falling faster than 
before: emissions have fallen about 1% a 
year since 1990, and will now fall 1.4% a year. 
The UK will go even further if other countries 
sign up to an ambitious global agreement.

 Executive summary 7

For the first time, UK Government 

departments have been allocated their 

own carbon budgets. Every delivery 
department will produce its own plan to 
show how it will stay within its carbon 
budget. If the Government fails to ensure that 
the UK lives within its carbon budgets then 
it will have to purchase credits from abroad.

One of the key ways the UK will achieve its 
carbon budgets is through a commitment 
in law to get 15% of all our energy – for 
electricity, heat and transport – from 
renewable sources by 2020. This White 
Paper sets out the Government’s plan 

to achieve this seven-fold increase, with 
more detailed plans in the Renewable Energy 
Strategy published in parallel with this 
Transition Plan.

This White Paper sets out the Transition 
Plan to 2020 for transforming our power 
sector, our homes and workplaces, our 
transport, our farming and the way we 
manage our land and waste, to meet 
these carbon budgets, secure energy 
supplies, maximise economic opportunities 
and protect the most vulnerable. These 
are detailed in the sections below. 

To deliver these goals the Government will:

Drive decarbonisation, by providing 
a carbon price, supporting the new 
technologies and infrastructure we need 
and helping households and businesses 
overcome barriers to low carbon choices.

Secure energy supplies by ensuring a 
supportive climate for the substantial 
new investment needed to bring 
forward low carbon infrastructure, and 
maximise the economic production 
of oil and gas from the North Sea to 
help secure the continued fossil fuel 
supplies needed during the transition. 

Help UK low carbon and energy 
businesses to grow.

Protect consumers, in particular the  
most vulnerable.

Help businesses manage the costs of 
tackling climate change and help everyone 
adapt to climate impacts.

Protect the environment by making the 
most of measures which bring wider 
environmental benefits and minimising 
impacts where they are unavoidable.

The plan will keep our energy supplies safe and secure

 Executive summary 9

Transforming our  
power sector
Three quarters of our electricity comes from 
coal and gas, and the power and heavy 
industry sector accounts for 35% of UK 
emissions. But by 2050 virtually all electricity 
will need to come from renewable sources, 
nuclear or fossil fuels where emissions 
are captured and safely stored for the long 
term. Electricity is likely to be used more 
extensively for heat and transport, so we will 
probably need more than today.

The plan to 2020 will secure power 

supplies and cut emissions from power 

and heavy industry together by 22% 

on 2008 levels, over half of the savings 

needed to meet carbon budgets, so that 

by 2020 around 40% of our electricity will 

come from low carbon sources. 

A key tool for delivering this is the EU 
Emissions Trading System which places a 

limit on emissions from electricity and heavy 
industry (and, from 2012, aviation too). 

But this alone will not be enough to enable 
the rapid development and use of low carbon 
technologies. So the Government is providing 
additional tailored support:

Renewables: renewable electricity 
will increase to around 30% by 2020, a 
five-fold increase.The Government is now 
launching the Office for Renewable 

Energy Deployment to help make this 
change happen, including developing 
supply chains to bring jobs to the UK, and 
is publishing a short list of possible Severn 
Tidal projects. 

Nuclear: the Government is streamlining 
the planning and regulatory approvals 
processes for new nuclear power stations. 
It is currently assessing sites where 
developers would like to bring new nuclear 
power stations into operation by 2025, 

The UK will need a bigger, smarter electricity grid for the future




10 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

and this assessment will be included in a 
draft National Policy Statement for nuclear 
power, which the Government will consult 
on later in 2009.

Carbon capture and storage: the 
Government has announced plans 
for a mechanism to support up to 
four demonstrations and a proposed 
requirement for any new coal power 
stations to demonstrate this technology, 
and measures to prepare the UK for roll out 
if the technology is proven. A consultation 
on these plans was launched in June 2009. 

We will also need a bigger, smarter 
electricity grid. The Government has 
therefore endorsed industry plans to increase 
grid capacity, taken action to speed up 
connection of renewable electricity to the 
grid and is supporting development of new 
technologies which could enable the grid to 
work better in the future. The Government 
will later this year publish a high 

level vision for a future smart grid and 
subsequently a plan for delivering this.

The scale and pace of the transformation 
that the Government expects to see in the 
electricity sector means that it needs to be 
alert to new challenges. Ensuring security 
of supply is a particular challenge because 
of the lead times for building new power 
stations and the requirement for significant 
capital investment. The Government is 
therefore creating a supportive climate for 
timely investment in a diverse mix of low 
carbon technologies. The Government is 
also ensuring that the market and regulatory 
framework can adapt to cope with the 
different characteristics of low carbon 
electricity generation technologies. 

The Government believes that the risk to 
security of electricity supplies over the next 
decade is low but that the scale and pace 
of change required will test the electricity 
market during the transition to a low carbon 

economy. The Government will shortly issue 
a call for evidence on electricity markets to 
further explore these issues. 

Transforming our homes 
and communities
Three quarters of the energy we use in our 
homes is for heating our rooms and water, 
most of which comes from gas-fired boilers. 
Together this accounts for 13% of the UK’s 
greenhouse gas emissions, and by 2050 
emissions from homes need to be almost 
zero by using energy more efficiently and 
using more low carbon energy. 

The plan to 2020 will cut emissions from 

homes by 29% on 2008 levels, introduce 

further measures to protect the most 

vulnerable, and improve the security of 

our gas supplies, a third of which is used 

in our homes. 

Two thirds of the homes we will live in by 
2050 have already been built, so we will  
need to make our existing homes much  
more energy efficient and heat and power 
them from low carbon sources. So the 
Government is:

Energy efficiency improvements could save 
households an average of £300 a year




 Executive summary 11

Increasing the obligation on energy 

suppliers to help households reduce 

emissions and save energy, the Carbon 

Emissions Reduction Target, by 20% 
between April 2008 and March 2011, 
so that about £3.2bn will be invested. 
Six million households have already 
been helped since 2002. But now the 
obligation will be extended to the end 

of 2012, which is expected to benefit 1.5 
million additional households.

Introducing a community-based 

approach to delivering significant 

energy efficiency treatments to 90,000 

homes in low-income areas, the 
Community Energy Saving Programme.

Piloting a move from upfront payment 

to ‘pay as you save’ models of long-

term financing for energy saving, so 
it will be more affordable to make the 
changes needed to make the whole house 
low carbon.

Introducing “clean energy cash-back” 

schemes so that people, businesses 
and communities will be paid if they use 
low carbon sources to generate heat or 
electricity. A household with well-sited 
solar panels could receive over £800, plus 
bill savings of around £140 a year.

We all need to act, and the Government is 
helping encourage collective action by:

Rolling out smart meters in every home 
by the end of 2020, which will enable 
people to understand their energy use, 
maximise opportunities for energy saving, 
and offer better services from energy 
companies.

Encouraging the provision of smart displays 
for existing meters now, benefitting some 
2-3 million households, and launching a 
new personal carbon challenge with 

rewards and incentives for saving 

energy.

Developing more proactive services 

from the Energy Saving Trust to provide 
households with information and advice 
when it is most likely to be useful.

Launching a competition for 15 
communities to be at the forefront of 
pioneering green initiatives.

Bigger changes will require new approaches, 
so the Government is:

Consulting on requiring Energy 
Performance Certificate ratings for 
rented properties to be put on property 
advertisements; and consulting on 
extending access to the performance 
information to help target efficiency offers 
and support.

Requiring new homes to be built to higher 
environmental standards and from 2016 all 
new homes will be ‘zero carbon homes’.

Considering how best to deliver significant 
‘whole house’ energy saving treatments 
in the longer term, setting out the strategy 
this autumn.

The policies in this Transition Plan will 
increase household energy bills. By 2020, 
the additional impact of all the policies in 
this plan, relative to today, is equivalent to 
approximately a 6% increase from current 
energy bills. When previously announced 
climate policies are included this figure is 8%.

The Government intends to clarify Ofgem’s 
remit. The Government continues to believe 
that effective competition remains the central 
way by which consumers’ interests can be 
protected. However, there are contexts in 
which means other than competition may be 
a preferable way to protect their interests. 
The Government proposes to amend the 

legislation to make this clearer, building 

on the existing legislation. 




12 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Tackling fuel poverty is a priority for the 
Government and it has set itself a target 
to end fuel poverty, as far as reasonably 
practicable, in vulnerable households by 2010 
and in all other households by 2016.

To help the most vulnerable, Government 
has already put in place a £20 billion package 
of support with payments for older and 
more vulnerable people, and subsidised 
energy efficiency measures and new heating 
systems. The Warm Front programme fits 
or repairs a central heating system every 
minute of every working day in vulnerable 
households across England. And more than 
800,000 vulnerable households in, or at risk 
of, fuel poverty currently receive discounts 
and other help with their energy bills as 
part of a voluntary agreement negotiated 
between Government and the energy 
companies. 

Now, in addition, the Government is:

Creating mandated social price support 
at the earliest opportunity with increased 
resources compared to the current 
voluntary system. The Government is 
minded to focus new resources particularly 
on older pensioners on the lowest 
incomes. 

Increasing the level of Warm Front 

grants so most people receiving benefits 
get their energy saving measures without 
having to contribute payment themselves.

Working to ensure that fuel poor 
households can benefit from new low 
carbon schemes, such as the Renewable 
Heat Incentive, to help reduce bills.

Most homes rely on gas for heating. This 
Transition Plan will reduce UK gas demand 
across the economy by 27% compared to 
2008 levels. But the UK remains heavily 
dependent on gas and so the Government 
is helping to ensure that the UK has reliable 
supplies. The UK is expected to rely on 

net imports to meet around 45% of its 
net gas demand in 2020, compared to the 
level of around 60% expected without the 
Government’s policies. But the diversity of 
its gas supplies has helped the UK to remain 
largely unaffected by international disputes. 
Future security of supply will also require that 
the UK improves its capacity to import and 
store gas and develops strategic partnerships 
with international gas suppliers.

The Government will shortly issue a 
commentary on the outlook for the security 
of UK gas supplies. Malcolm Wicks MP has 
reviewed how the UK can maintain secure 
energy supplies during the transition to a 
low carbon economy, and his report will be 
published in the coming months.

Transforming our 
workplaces and jobs
The changes we need to make to 2020 and 
beyond will transform our workplaces and 
our whole economy. Our workplaces are 
responsible for 20% of UK emissions.  
By 2050 all of our workplaces will need  
to be using less energy and making use 
of clean energy to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and potentially save billions of 
pounds each year. 

The plan to 2020 will cut emissions from 

our workplaces by 13% on 2008 levels, 

and build the UK’s position as a global 

centre of green manufacturing in low 

carbon sectors such as offshore wind, 

marine energy, low carbon construction 

and ultra-low carbon vehicles.

The Government will help reduce emissions 
from workplaces by:

Including high carbon industries in the 
EU Emissions Trading System, which will 
save around 500 million tonnes of carbon 
dioxide a year across the EU by 2020.




 Executive summary 13

Providing financial support and incentives 
for business and the public sector to 
save energy and invest in low carbon 
technologies including the Climate Change 
Levy and Climate Change Agreements, 
Carbon Reduction Commitment and low 
cost loans and grants for businesses and 
the public sector. 

Providing advice to help all workplaces 
change through the Carbon Trust, Business 
Link, the Waste and Resources Action 
Programme and Envirowise. 

But there will be costs from this transition: 
the additional impact in 2020 of the policies 
in this Transition Plan, relative to today, is 
equivalent to approximately a 15% increase 
in current energy bills for businesses 
consuming a medium amount of energy. 
When previously announced climate policies 
are included this is 17%. The Government is 
working to ensure that competitive energy 
markets deliver low cost energy and EU 
frameworks are fair to business.

But there are also huge opportunities for UK 
businesses to take part in the £3 trillion world 
low carbon market that will employ over 1 
million people in the UK by the middle of the 
next decade. 

To help make the UK a world centre of the 
green economy, the Government is:

Investing in research and development 

of new low carbon technologies, 

including by using the £405 million 

announced in April 2009 to deliver a 

major boost to technologies where 

the UK has the greatest potential, as 
described in more detail in the UK Low 
Carbon Industrial Strategy published in 
parallel with this Transition Plan. 

This includes up to £120 million of 
investment in offshore wind, and 

investment of up to an additional £60 

million to cement the UK’s position 

as a global leader in marine energy 

and help develop the South West of 

England as the UK’s first Low Carbon 

Economic Area.

The plan will also deliver support 

for a smart electrical grid, ultra-low 

carbon vehicle infrastructure and 

exploration of deep geothermal 

power.

Helping businesses to take up new 
opportunities by strengthening delivery of 
support for research and development, and 
taking action to help employees develop 
new skills.

Supporting businesses through the global 
financial crisis and facilitating access to up 
to £4 billion of new capital for renewable 
and other energy projects from the 
European Investment Bank.

There could be 1.2 million people in the UK working 
in green sectors by 2015




14 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Transforming transport
A fifth of our greenhouse gas emissions 
come from transport but by 2050 they will 
have to be radically reduced by using energy 
more efficiently and moving to more low 
carbon forms of energy.

The plan to 2020 will cut emissions from 

transport by 14% on 2008 levels and 

secure the oil supplies needed during the 

transition to a low carbon country. 

As set out in Low Carbon Transport: a 
Greener Future published in parallel with this 
Transition Plan, the first step is to improve 
the fuel efficiency of new conventional 
vehicles, so the Government is:

Cutting average carbon dioxide 

emissions from new cars across the EU 

to 95g/km by 2020, a 40% reduction from 
2007 levels.

Ensuring that the Government leads by 
example by setting targets for government 
departments and their agencies to procure 
new cars for administrative purposes that 
meet the EU standard for 2015 in 2011, 
four years early

Pressing the EU to require new vans 
to be more efficient.

 Investing up to £30 million over the next 

two years to deliver several hundred 

low carbon buses.

We must move away from petrol and diesel 
in the long term. So the Government is 
testing out options for the radically different 
technologies needed by:

Demonstrating 340 new electric and 

lower carbon cars on the UK’s roads, the 
largest project of its kind in the world. 

Providing help worth about £2,000 to 

£5,000 per vehicle towards reducing 

the price of ultra-low carbon cars, from 

2011, and up to £30 million to support 
the installation of electric vehicle charging 
infrastructure in six or so cities across the 


UK. 


Committing to source 10% of UK transport 
energy from sustainable renewable 
sources by 2020. 

Cutting transport emissions is not just 
about changing technologies. We all need 
to make low carbon travel choices, and the 
Government is helping by:

Launching a competition for the 
country’s first Sustainable Travel City, 
building on projects in towns which saw 
reported car trips fall by 9%, walking 
increase by 14% and cycling increase by 


12%.


Investing £140 million in promoting cycling 
in England in 2008-11, and a new £5 
million investment in improving cycle 

storage at rail stations.

Emissions from international flights and ships 
are growing. The Government is pushing hard 
for an international agreement to cut them, 
the only truly effective way to do so, and 
meanwhile is:

The Government is improving cycle storage facilities 
in railway stations




 Executive summary 15

Putting a cap on emissions from all flights 
arriving at or leaving from European 
airports by including them in the EU 
Emissions Trading System from 2012.

Introducing a target to limit UK aviation 
emissions to below 2005 levels by 2050, 
despite forecast growth in passenger 
demand, which is likely to be met 
through more efficient engines and other 
new technologies, and supported by 
government policies such as changes to 
airport passenger duty.

In the longer term the UK needs to reduce its 
dependence on oil for transport but it will still 
be an important fuel for some time to come 
and the Government needs to help ensure 
that the UK has safe and secure supplies of 
the oil products it requires. The Government’s 
approach is to maximise the economic 
exploitation of the UK’s own oil reserves, to 
work with other countries to ensure a well-
functioning global oil market, and to improve 
UK fuel infrastructure.

Transforming farming 
and managing our land 
and waste sustainably
Farms, changes in land use and waste 
contribute 11% of UK greenhouse gas 
emissions. We need to find ways of emitting 
less while safeguarding our environment and 
producing food sustainably. The equivalent 
of around 37 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide 
is currently locked into natural reservoirs 
of carbon like soils and forests – we need 
to carefully manage our land to keep these 
stores locked away.

The UK now recycles or composts a third of 
its waste, but we need to do more because 
rubbish dumped on landfills continues 
emitting greenhouse gas for many decades.

The plan to 2020 will cut emissions from 

farming and waste by 6% on 2008 levels 

through:

Encouraging English farmers to take 

action themselves to reduce emissions 

to at least 6% lower than currently 

predicted by 2020, through more efficient 
use of fertiliser, and better management of 
livestock and manure.

Support for anaerobic digestion, a 
technology that turns waste and manure 
into renewable energy. 

Reducing the amount of waste sent to 
landfills, and better capture of landfill 
emissions.

The plan will also encourage private 
funding for woodland creation.

For the first time farming and land use emissions will 
be included in a framework for tackling emissions

22 Summary

Action on climate change is urgently needed 
to prevent widespread human suffering, 
ecological catastrophes, and political 
and economic instability. In 2006, the 
Stern Review concluded that the costs of 
uncontrolled climate change could be in the 
range of 5% to 20% of global gross domestic 
product (GDP) per year, averaged over time.1

Action to reduce greenhouse gas  
emissions can offer improved energy and 
international security, a better environment, 
new economic opportunities and a fairer 
society. If emissions are reduced in a low 
cost way to a level that avoids the most 
dangerous risks of climate change, then  
the costs of acting could be as low as 1%  
to 2% of global GDP by 2050.2

Achieving this and preventing climate change 
will require a strong global framework; the 
UK is arguing for an international deal at 
Copenhagen in December that is ambitious, 
effective and fair.

Like every country, the UK must take  
action now. We need to plan our own low 
carbon transition. This will mean major 
changes to the way we use and supply 
energy. We need to ensure secure supplies 
of energy throughout the transition and 
to deliver change in a way that maximises 
economic opportunities and protects the 
most vulnerable.

Extreme weather conditions will become more frequent as the climate changes

Summary

22 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

1.  Direct costs: not including costs such as those related to political and economic disruption, and impacts of migrations
2.  Based on a target stabilisation concentration of greenhouse gases of 450-550 parts per million

 The challenge

3.  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (2007)

The urgency  
of action 
The consensus of scientists spanning over 
130 countries, is now overwhelming: human 
activities are causing global climate change.3 
The burning of fossil fuels, changes in land 
use, and various industrial processes are 
adding heat-trapping gases, particularly 
carbon dioxide (CO


2

), to the atmosphere. 

There is now roughly 40% more CO


2 in 


the atmosphere than there was before the 
industrial revolution. Such high levels have 
not been experienced on earth for at least 
800,000 years and in all likelihood not for the 
last three million years.

The effects of these additional greenhouse 
gases can already be seen today. Global 
average temperatures have risen by  
0.75°C since about 1900 (see chart 1),  
with consequences for both the environment 
and people’s lives.

Source: Met Office (2009)

1.  Sunlight passes 
through the 
atmosphere and 
warms the earth.

2.  Infrared Radiation 
(IR) is given off by 
the earth. Most IR 
escapes to outer 
space and cools the 
earth.

3.  But some IR is 
trapped by gases 
in the air and this 
reduces the cooling 
effect.

Summer Arctic sea ice continues to 
decline, with the smallest amounts  
ever recorded occurring in 2007 and  
2008 (see figure 2). 

Global sea levels have already risen by 
10cm over the last 50 years, and are 
conservatively projected to increase by 
between 18 and 59 cm by the end of this 
century, increasing the flood risk for some 
major coastal cities.

Ocean acidity is rising as a result of 
greenhouse gases, and is already having 
a detrimental impact on the many ocean 
animals that build shells of calcium 
carbonate, including many tropical reef-
building corals, molluscs and crustaceans 
such as lobsters.

Plants and animals from warmer climates 
now inhabit previously cooler regions. In 
some marine and freshwater systems, 
changes in the abundance of algae, 
plankton and fish are associated with  
rising water temperatures.

Rising temperatures are already  
affecting aspects of human health,  
such as heat-related deaths during  
heat waves and changes in the spread  
of infectious disease.

Within the UK, the nine hottest days on 
record for central England have all occurred 
in the last 15 years with 2006 being the

 Chapter 1: 25
 The challenge

If climate change continues unchecked, 
the additional consequences for the UK 
will be severe. The UK Climate Projections, 
published in 2009, gives the most detailed 
predictions yet of the most likely major 

changes to the UK’s climate in the absence of 
action to cut global emissions. For example, 
by 2080 we can expect:

More droughts: In Yorkshire and Humber, 
summer rainwater could drop by a quarter. 

More flooding: In the South East, winter 
rains and snow could increase by almost  
a third. 

Damaging heat waves: In 2003, an 
increase in average temperature of just 
two degrees led to 35,000 extra deaths 
across Europe. Such summers could soon 
count as being cooler than average. In 
the West Midlands, without a reduction 
in emissions, summer averages could 
increase by almost five degrees.

Across the world, the consequences of 
failing to control emissions would be worse 
still (see figure 4). 70% of Africans rely on 
agriculture for a living; by 2020, climate 
change is predicted to cut some rain-fed 
farming harvests by half in the continent.5 
Two of every three people on earth could 
experience water shortages by 2025.6 Three-

quarters of a billion people in Asia rely on 
water that melts steadily from glaciers in 
the Himalayas; but the glaciers are already 
melting faster than in any other part of the 
world, and if the present rate continues, they 
are likely to disappear by 2035.8 By 2050, 200 
million people could be rendered homeless 
by rising sea levels, floods and drought.9 By 
2080, an extra 600 million people worldwide 

could be affected by malnutrition and an 
extra 400 million people could be exposed to 
malaria.10

The world’s poorest countries will bear 
the brunt of a changing climate. A rise in 
temperature of a few degrees would slow or 
even reverse their development, and directly 
prevent poor people from lifting themselves 
from poverty.

Temperature increase relative to 1961 baseline, projections based on different ‘business as usual’ scenarios. 
The high scenario is based on heavier reliance on fossil fuels, whereas the low scenario assumes a strong 
move away from fossil fuels.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change definition of the central estimate is “as likely as not”. It is 
important to consider the entire range of projections to gain a full picture of the distribution of uncertainty, 
and to encompass all possible changes in climate, as indicated by the current science.7

28 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

A stable climate 
and a better life
These impacts are not  
inevitable. Early action can 
prevent the worst excesses 
of climate change. It can also 
improve the security of Britain’s 
energy supplies, create new 
economic opportunities, bring 
wider environmental benefits,  
and lead to a fairer society.

Energy security
The action that the Government is taking to 
cut emissions from the energy sector is good 
for the security of our energy supplies too. 
Global energy demand is forecast to increase 
by around 45% between 2006 and 2030, 
with almost 80% of this increase coming 
from fossil fuels.11

Without action, the UK would rely even 
more on imported fossil fuels and would 
have greater exposure to global energy price 
fluctuations (see chart 2), especially when 
demand recovers as the world emerges from 
the global economic downturn.

In 2008 the UK imported about 25% of the 
gas that it used. Projections suggest that by 
2020 this could rise to around 60%12. But 
with the measures in this plan, especially 
those which help to decarbonise our 
electricity supplies and increase our heat 
efficiency, we can reduce this to 45%.13

Substantial private sector investment  
will be needed to deliver this new low  
carbon infrastructure. The UK Government 
wants to ensure reliable, secure supplies of 
energy during the transition, including from 
the fossil fuels we will continue to rely on 
in the future. The pathway to delivering low 
carbon energy supplies is a necessary one 
but will need careful design to manage the 
energy security risks.

Preventing climate change and securing energy supplies go hand-in-hand

 Chapter 1: 29
 The challenge

Economic opportunities
The economic case for urgent action is 
compelling. First, the costs of not acting are 
much greater than the costs of acting: in 
2006, Lord Stern, former Chief Economist of 
the World Bank, estimated that if the world 
did nothing to tackle climate change then 
changes to global weather systems could 
inflict costs equivalent to between 5% and 
20% of global GDP a year, averaged over 
time.14 He has since said that new science 
research published since the Stern Review 
suggested the review underestimated the 
risks and dangers of inaction.15 On the other 
hand, if the world takes action to reduce 
emissions in a low cost way to a level 
consistent with avoiding dangerous climate 

change, Stern estimates the cost as 1%  
to 2% of global GDP by 2050.16

Second, acting on climate change will 
stimulate innovation and new technologies 
to help businesses reduce energy costs, and 
will provide employment in ‘green industries’. 
Already, low carbon and environmental goods 
and services are worth an estimated £3 
trillion worldwide.17 This fast growing global 
market will generate huge demand for the 
technologies, goods and services that will 
allow countries across the world to make the 
transition to a low carbon economy. 

There will be costs to business in adapting to 
this world, and every part of the economy will 
need to change the way it operates, but for 
those who seize them, the opportunities are

 National strategy for climate and energy

equally vast. The UK, which already has a low 
carbon and environmental sector worth £106 
billion a year, has the chance to become a 
world centre of green manufacturing, and the 
Government is committed to help business 
to grasp that opportunity.

There will be broader benefits for 
international and national security.18 The 
effects of climate change are one of the 
key drivers of national security threats, 
exacerbating weaknesses and tensions 
around the world.19 The changes that 
scientists are predicting in our climate unless 
we can stabilise it will worsen poverty, have 
a significant impact on global migration 
patterns, and risk tipping fragile countries  
into instability, conflict and state failure.

Fairness
Tackling climate change provides many 
opportunities to create a fairer society. 
Some of these actions will require upfront 
investment, but they will bring long-term 
benefits, in particular for the poor and most 
vulnerable. Better insulation can make 
homes more comfortable in winter, and 
more green spaces can provide a cooler 
environment in summer (reducing the need 
for air conditioning) and also renew run-
down areas. Innovative transport options 
and more flexible working patterns can make 
it easier to use public transport or to cycle, 
and reduce the need for commuting. Health 
improvements will also be gained by the 
reduction in air pollution, for example from 
car engines. Grasping the opportunities for 
solving problems together can build a sense 
of community, wherever people live.

Preventing dangerous climate change is 
self-evidently in Britain’s national interest: 
in the interests of citizens who want a 
healthier life, a more prosperous economy 
and greater international and energy security. 
But more fundamentally, given the impact 
and permanency of the effects, it is a moral 
imperative. Future generations will pay the 
price if we fail to rise to this challenge.

Low carbon industries offer exciting global business 
opportunities

There will be many lifestyle advantages of a low 
carbon economy

Global climate 
change needs a 
global response 

For all these reasons, the UK is arguing for  
an international agreement that matches  
the scale of the challenge. 

Under the United Nations, countries from 
around the world will meet in Copenhagen 
in December 2009. The UK argues that the 
ambition of the deal must match the science. 
If temperature rises exceed 2°C compared 
to pre-industrial times, the risks of major, 
irreversible changes and feedback effects 

increase. Even if the world could stabilise 
levels of greenhouse gases tomorrow, 
warming of at least 1.4°C by 2100 is almost 
certain due to the time lag between 
emissions and temperature rise.20

In an effort to keep the increase below 2°C, 
the UK is calling for developed countries 
as a group to reduce their emissions by 
at least 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 
levels, including stretching mid-term 
targets on a pathway to getting there. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 
analysis suggests developed countries should 
collectively reduce their emissions by 25-
40% below 1990 levels by 2020. But even if 
developed countries could reduce emissions 
to zero, the world as a whole would still not 
avoid temperature increases above 2°C.

Act on Copenhagen

www.actoncopenhagen.gov.uk is 
the official UK Government website 
presenting information on the climate 
change negotiations. It will act as the 
domestic and international hub for 
information and communications 
in the lead up to the UN talks in 
Copenhagen in December 2009.

The Copenhagen conference will be a key  
stage in building global agreement to act  
on climate change

That is because of the predicted growth of 
developing countries. The UK is therefore 
calling for action from developing countries 
that would see global emissions peak by 
2020 and fall to less than 50% of 1990  
levels by 2050.

An ambitious agreement must also ensure 
that all major sources of emissions are 
included, including those from international 
aviation and shipping and deforestation. 

A global agreement must also be effective: 
if countries are to meet ambitious emission 
reduction commitments then investment 
must flow to where it has the most effect. 
The UK therefore supports the development 
of a global carbon market, including the 
expansion and linking of emissions trading 
systems as part of a broader economic 
transformation needed for a low carbon world.

Finally, the UK argues the global deal must  
be fair. A priority for Copenhagen will be to 
put in place finance to support developing 
countries to cut their emissions and adapt  
to climate change.

The transition 
starts at home
The negotiations on a global deal are not a 
reason to delay action at home, but are a 
reason to act now. The UK is playing a leading  
role in driving international negotiations,  
and cannot expect others to sign up to a  
deal unless we show a firm commitment  
to change ourselves.

This Transition Plan shows how the UK is 
going to deliver the immense changes that 
are required. A transition of this scale needs 
a comprehensive plan to map the best 
opportunities, the sequences of decisions 
and the part that every sector, business 

and household can play, ensuring that the 
necessary changes are carried through in  
the most cost-effective way. 

In delivering the transition to low carbon,  
this plan will also provide:

security of our energy supplies;

economic opportunities; and

fairness for consumers, keeping bills as 
low as possible, particularly for the most 
vulnerable.

36 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

As set out in chapter 1, the scale of change 
we need in our economy and, in particular, 
our energy system is unparalleled. If we 
are to achieve this, Government will need 
to drive change by setting clear goals and a 
comprehensive plan to meet them. 

Carbon budgets set the pathway. They are 
a world first: legally-binding caps on the 
greenhouse gases that the country produces 
over five-year periods. Informed by the 
evidence and monitored by the independent 
Committee on Climate Change, they chart 
the course to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions by at least 80% below 1990  
levels by 2050.

The first three carbon budgets were  
set in law following Budget 2009,  
committing to cut the UK’s greenhouse  
gas emissions, compared to 1990 levels, by 
22% in the current period, 28% in the period 
centred on 2015, and 34% in the period 
centred on 2020.

The UK has already made large savings. 
The country is set to deliver almost twice 
the greenhouse gas reductions the UK is 
committed to under Kyoto. But to stay  
within the carbon budgets, and have a 
contingency margin, a further 715 million 
tonnes of greenhouse gas savings are 
needed, including 459 million tonnes over  
the third period. 

This will be stretching. It will need a view 
across sectors to make sure effort is focused 
in the most cost effective way, and one that 
covers both immediate action and long-term 
thinking: in short, a comprehensive plan. 

The plan must harness the power of 
dynamic, competitive markets. However 
markets alone will not be enough - there 
is a strategic role for government. This 
means putting a price on carbon, driving 
new technologies, helping individuals and 
businesses to make informed choices, acting 
to maintain secure supplies (for example of 
the fossil fuels that we will continue to need 
for some time and in planning low carbon 
technologies), protecting the most vulnerable 
and maximising economic opportunities. 
Communities, too, have an active role: many 
are already organising themselves to bring 
about change in their own areas. 

The plan also shows the balance of  
effort between sectors, based on  
bottom-up analysis of where savings  
are most cost-effective.

To stay on track, the Government is moving 
to a radical new approach. Every major 
decision now needs to take account of the 
impact on the carbon budget as well as the 
financial budget. The budget constraint will 
be real: failure to reduce emissions through 
policies and measures could mean a need 
to buy credits from abroad. A shortfall of 
25 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, for 
example, assuming credits are £20/tonne, 
would mean a £500 million liability.

As important, the move to carbon budgets 
will mean that many more people have direct 
responsibility for action. The Government 
is piloting a new approach in which all 
major government departments have been 
allocated their own carbon budget, which will

38 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The previous chapter showed how 
demanding the task is: a rapid transition to a 
low-carbon economy, in doing so, ensuring 
that energy supplies remain secure, new 
economic opportunities are maximised, costs 
are minimised and the most vulnerable are 
protected. This chapter explains how the 
Government will drive the transition, with:

A clear pathway to 2020 and beyond;

A comprehensive plan to meet it: 
action will be achieved through dynamic 
and competitive markets, strategic 
government, and active communities; 
the plan will also set out how emissions 
reductions in each part of the economy  
add up to the total needed.

A new system to share responsibility 
across Government to help the UK to  
stay within its budget.

How the Government manages the  
costs of transition.

Setting the 
Pathway: carbon 
budgets
The UK’s pathway is underpinned by  
the Climate Change Act, which became law 
in 2008. The Act commits the UK to achieving 
at least an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. 
This was the target recommended by the 
independent Committee on Climate Change 
as a fair and achievable share of the target to 
at least halve global emissions by 2050. 

The Climate Change Act made the UK the 
first country in the world to adopt a long-term 

legal framework for reducing emissions: 
a system of five-year “carbon budgets”, 
which provide a clear pathway for reducing 
emissions into the future. Carbon budgets 
are a limit on the total quantity of greenhouse 
gas emissions over a five year period. 
They reflect the fact that the UK’s overall 
contribution to reducing global greenhouse 
gas emissions is determined by our 
emissions into the atmosphere over time, not 
by meeting specific targets in specific years. 

The Committee on Climate Change  
also advises on the level of each budget,  
and provides scrutiny by reporting each  
year on progress. It ensures that the 
framework for the UK is guided by the 
science and evidence. 

Carbon savings to 2020
The Government announced the first  
three budgets, covering the periods 2008-
12, 2013-17 and 2018-22, in April 2009 (see 
table 1 below). These budgets are in line with 
those recommended by the Committee on 
Climate Change.

The UK is already on the path to cut 
emissions – and to deliver around twice the 
emissions reductions we are committed to 
under Kyoto – but the new carbon budgets 
will be stretching. The final budget period 
centred on 2020 requires a 34% cut on 1990 
levels (or an 18% cut on 2008 levels), which 
requires an additional 420 million tonnes of 
savings.3 This plan sets out the proposals and 
policies for meeting the UK’s carbon budgets, 
as required by the Climate Change Act.

Chart 2 below provides an illustration of

Box 1
Climate Change Act: The First Three Carbon Budgets 

What happens if an ambitious global 

deal is reached at Copenhagen?

The Government has committed to 
moving to tighter carbon budgets if a 
credible deal is reached at Copenhagen, 
and this will require the UK to cut its 
emissions even further. Tighter budgets 
are expected to be in line with the 
UK’s share of the EU commitment to 
increase its 2020 target to as much as 
a 30% reduction on 1990 levels if other 
developed countries make comparable 
efforts under a new global agreement. 

The extra effort to meet them can be 
made in different ways. As part of its 
30% target, the EU will adopt a tighter 
cap for the EU Emissions Trading 
System (EU ETS). For emissions not 
capped by the EU ETS, the Government 
then has a choice between driving 
additional emissions reductions at 
home, for example through policies to 
incentivise cleaner transport or further 
efficiency improvements in housing 
stock, or purchasing offset credits that 
will deliver emissions reductions in 
developing economies. It will be guided 
by the most cost effective path towards 
the 2020 and 2050 targets, and will 

ask the Committee on Climate Change 
to review its recommended budgets 
following a global deal and once 
proposals on sharing out the new  
EU target are agreed.

Can offset credits from abroad be 

counted? 

The carbon budgets set a limit on the 
level of the net UK carbon account. 
This is calculated by adjusting net UK 
greenhouse gas emissions to account 
for any carbon units which have 
been brought in from overseas by 
Government and others to offset UK 
emissions (‘credits’), and UK carbon 
units which have been disposed 
of outside the UK (‘debits’). The 
Government is aiming to meet the 
current budgets through domestic 
emissions reductions, without 
purchasing international offset credits, 
and this Transition Plan shows how 
this will be achieved. Delivering current 
carbon budgets through domestic effort 
will help prepare the UK for the move to 
a tougher 2020 target. 

However, carbon units can still be 
bought or sold from abroad by 
companies participating in the EU 
Emissions Trading System, and the net 
UK carbon account must take account 
of this, whether it represents an overall 
credit against the budget (if, taken 
together, UK participants in the EU ETS 
buy more carbon units than they sell) 
or a debit (if they sell more than they 
buy).5 The Government expects UK 
participants in the EU ETS to vary over 
the three budget periods between being 
net sellers and net purchasers of credits 
and allowances from abroad.

The UK’s carbon budgets and 2050 targets are  
set in law




 Chapter 2: 41
  Driving the transition

A comprehensive 


plan

Cost-effective changes require an economy-
wide approach: effort must be concentrated 
where it will achieve the most for the least 
cost. To track delivery the Government must 
measure greenhouse gas savings across the 
economy to make sure overall emissions fall 
within the total budget. 

Decisions cannot be guided by their short 
term impact alone. Changes to our homes 
and our energy infrastructure, for example, 
will have impacts lasting for decades so we 
must take action today while taking into 
account the changes that we will need to 
make in the future. As we move towards 
delivering a low carbon UK we must also act 
to maintain secure energy supplies, create 
jobs and ensure fairness. We therefore need 
a comprehensive plan.

A plan for governments, 
markets and 
communities
The plan includes a strategic role for 
government: putting the conditions in place 
for dynamic, competitive markets, mobilising 

communities and driving forward the 
transition to a low carbon economy and the 
sustainable development of the UK.

Government needs to put in place the 
necessary conditions for markets to be 
competitive. This means an independent 
regulator with responsibility for ensuring 
competition and proactively protecting 
consumers interests.

But markets alone cannot deliver a transition 
of this speed or scale. Failures in the market 
mean people or businesses can take 
decisions that are right individually, but lead 
to worse outcomes for society as a whole.

Lord Stern’s Review of the Economics of 
Climate Change (2006) showed that in 
reducing emissions governments need to 
act in three ways to deliver change. These 
broadly guide the Government’s strategic 
interventions.

First, governments should put a price on 
carbon emissions to reflect the true costs of 
the damage caused through climate change, 
and to give incentives to consumers and 
companies to move to cleaner technologies 
or to change their behaviour. Chapter 3 
outlines how the power sector and heavy 
industry now have to factor in the price of 
carbon through the European cap-and-trade 
scheme, the European Union Emissions 
Trading System (EU ETS). 

Do carbon budgets offer flexibility? 

Lord Stern’s Review of the Economics 
of Climate Change (2006) emphasises 
the importance of flexibility when 
designing policies to reduce the impact 
of climate change. The five-year budget 
system therefore allows “banking” 
and “borrowing” between budgets to 
increase the system’s flexibility. Any 
emissions reductions which exceed 

those budgeted can be “banked” to 
help meet the next budget period, 
which rewards early action. Similarly, 
“borrowing” a limited quantity of 
emissions rights from the subsequent 
period will smooth out unexpected 
events towards the end of a budget e.g. 
a severe winter leading to higher energy 
demand and more emissions. 




42 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Second, government must drive the  
new technology and infrastructure that  
is needed. Businesses do not invest as  
much or as quickly in these areas as society 
needs, both because of the risks involved  
and because many of the benefits of 
investment do not accrue to the firm, but 
to society more generally. For example 
the Government is funding incentives 
and infrastructure to encourage swifter 
deployment of electric cars. 

Third, government must help people  
make low carbon choices. People and 
businesses often face obstacles such as 
upfront costs, a lack of information, or inertia. 
Government provides information and wider 
support for households to install insulation. 

To maintain energy security, the Government 
needs to ensure a supportive investment 
climate so that new low carbon energy 
infrastructure is built and, because we will  
be reliant on fossil fuels for many years to 
come, to ensure that we maximise the  
UK’s own economic reserves of oil and  
gas and have secure supply chains for the 
energy we do import. 

To maximise the economic opportunities of 
transition, the Government is building up the 
skills and infrastructure needed, developing 
regional hubs and putting in place support for 
the new industries of the future, as described 
in chapter 5 and in the UK Low Carbon 
Industrial Strategy published in par allel with 
this Transition Plan. And the Government is 
acting to secure fairness, through providing 
support to the most vulnerable and improving 
the energy efficiency of their homes.

Tackling climate change is clearly crucial to 
protect our natural environment. But the 
Government will work to ensure that the 
action it takes improves the environment 
more widely, making our cities healthier 
and quieter, cutting our resource use and 
protecting the natural environment. But 
where impacts cannot reasonably be  
avoided, the Government will take steps  
to minimise them.

The UK has a target to produce 15% of its energy 
from renewable sources by 2020




 Chapter 2: 43
  Driving the transition

The balance of effort 
A comprehensive plan also needs to include 
communities, individuals and businesses. 
Many thousands of people are already 
working together, exchanging ideas and 
spurring each other on. The transition 
cannot happen without them, and this plan 
announces a range of further support (see 
chapter 4).

The UK’s Transition Plan sets out how we will 
cut emissions by 459 million tonnes by the 
third carbon budget. On the basis of current 
central projections the Government will 
over-deliver the reductions needed to meet 
the third budget by a margin of 39 million 
tonnes in that period, and by 147 million 
tonnes over all three carbon budgets. This 

will help provide a buffer against uncertainty, 
and prepare for a tightening of the carbon 
budgets that will follow an ambitious 
international deal.

This will need action in every sector of the 
economy. Chart 4 shows where the savings 
will be made, based on the policies in 
succeeding chapters. 

A major contribution to meeting the carbon 
budgets comes from the transition to 
renewable sources of energy, covering 
electricity, heat and transport. Under an 
agreement to drive the uptake of renewable 
energy across Europe, 15% of energy in the 
UK must be renewable by 2020 (see chart 
5). The UK Renewable Energy Strategy is 
published in parallel with this document.

Staying  
on budget
These budgets need to be met despite 
uncertainty about the future. Some policies, 
like the EU Emissions Trading System, 
guarantee that net emissions will be no 
higher than the limit or ‘cap’ that is set. 
However, in other sectors the Government 
cannot be completely confident in advance 
about future emissions. There is uncertainty 
about what policy will deliver and whether 
other factors, such as faster than expected 
economic growth will drive up emissions. 

Chart 6 shows that the UK is on track to meet 
its carbon budgets on central projections 
and has factored in an additional contingency 
margin to mitigate some of the uncertainty 
described above. 

There are a number of other ways in which 
the Government is working to increase the 
certainty that the UK will meet its carbon 
budgets.6 Emissions projections have been 
improved to remove any double counting 
of carbon savings, and the Government is 
continuing to explore new policy options, 
such as new ways to help small businesses 
to save carbon. 

The introduction of carbon budgets 
introduces a new imperative: they are  
legally binding and must be met. As a  
result there are also risk management  
tools that could be used if required as a 
last resort: the provision to “bank” and 
“borrow” (within defined limits) between 
budget periods, and to buy international 
credits to offset domestic emissions. In 
effect, there will be a cash penalty for failing 
to meet the plan: a shortfall of 25 million 
tonnes of greenhouse gases, for example, 
assuming credits are £20/tonne, would mean 
a liability of £500 million. While they remain 
an insurance option, these tools are not part 
of this Transition Plan, and the Government 
has set a legal limit preventing it from buying 
credits for the first budget period.

higher education institutions and the NHS. 

Second, an allocation is made to all delivery 
departments depending on their degree of 
influence on reducing emissions in each 
sector of the economy. This will incentivise 
departments to work together in a 
collaborative way to reduce emissions across 
the economy. For example, the Department 
for Transport and the Department for 
Children, Schools and Families will have an 
interest in helping parents to make choices 
that will reduce emissions from the school 
run, such as using yellow school buses or 
cycling to school.

budgets, the Government’s expectation of the range over which the net UK carbon account might fall, taking 
into account uncertainty.

Taking responsibility 
across government
Every part of Government will need to  
help drive the transition that is needed to  
live within the UK’s carbon budgets. For 
the first time, each major government 
department will now have its own 
carbon budget representing its share of 
responsibility (see chart 7). This pilots a  
new approach in Government. 

The budgets will be made up of  
two elements.

First, an allocation is made to reflect 
emissions from Departments’ own estate 
and operations. From April 2010, it will also

Business, Innovation and Skills 7% 

Communities and Local Government 5% 

Department for Children Schools and Families 0.4%

Department of Health 1% 

Other 2%

The Government’s plans are for emissions 
reductions in the government estate to 
be at least as ambitious as the rest of the 
economy. For the Department of Energy and 
Climate Change (DECC) to set an example, 
it has challenged itself to reduce its own 
emissions by 10% in 2009 -10.  

To underpin the delivery of its carbon budget, 
each department will publish its own carbon 
reduction plan by Spring 2010. These will set 
out in detail the actions the department will 
take, on its own and working with others, 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 
the parts of the wider economy that it can 
influence, as well as from its own estate and 
use of transport. These plans will include 
milestones and indicators to measure 
progress and ensure that planned actions  
are delivered.

Every department will also publish its plans 
to cope with the effects of climate change 
that are already unavoidable. The details of 
the budget-setting process and the budget 
for departments in each period are given 
in Annex B. This approach will be reviewed 
ahead of the second budget period.

HM Treasury will play a key role in the 
departmental carbon budget system, 
supporting the delivery of carbon budgets  
in keeping with its role at the centre  
of government. 

The UK Government is one of the first to 
integrate climate change and energy issues in 
one department, through the creation of the 
Department of Energy and Climate Change 
(DECC). DECC has overall responsibility for 
ensuring delivery of all the measures set 
out in this plan. Following publication, and 
in parallel with the emerging work on the 
vision for 2050 (set out in chapter 8), DECC 
will work with its delivery partners and wider 
stakeholders on the necessary arrangements 
to ensure the commitments set out here 
today are delivered effectively. 

Managing costs 
As described in chapter 1, tackling climate 
change is the lower cost option for Britain: 
failure to act would mean more extreme 
droughts and floods, greater  
dependency on imported fossil fuels,  
and a missed opportunity to lead new  
low-carbon industries. 

The UK can meet its carbon budgets at 
the same time as doubling the size of its 
economy by 2020 on 1990 levels,7 and in 
doing so deliver extra benefits, including 
improved energy security and local 
environmental quality. The UK is expected 
to rely on net imports to meet around 45% 




48 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

of its net gas demand in 2020, compared to 
the level of around 60% expected without 
the Government’s policies to reduce demand 
(see chart 8).

There is therefore a compelling argument for 
pursuing the policies set out in this Plan. They 
do come at a cost however – such as extra 
investment in low carbon technologies, which 
needs to be properly managed. 

Table 2 presents today’s value of the costs of 
the policies set out in this plan including both 
public and private costs.8 Total net costs over 
the lifetimes of these policies are estimated 
to lie between £25 and £29 billion.

These net costs are significant but are 
broadly consistent with other estimates  
of the costs of action on climate change.9 
Net cost estimates for some components 
of the package are somewhat lower than 
previously estimated owing to changes  
in fossil fuel price assumptions and  
wider factors. 

In developing the package of policies, 
the Government has focussed wherever 
possible on the most cost effective sources 
of emissions reductions. As highlighted in 
table 2, many of the policies to meet carbon 
budgets have a negative cost, which means 
they help tackle climate change and save 
resources for the economy while saving on 
bills. This is particularly the case for policies to 
improve energy efficiency in the household 
sector (see chapter 4). As set out in chapter 
5, the transition to low carbon will bring costs 
but also business benefits. 

The impact from the policies to households 
and businesses will be through higher prices 
for some carbon-intensive goods and services 
and changing patterns of consumption. 
However, the most significant impact on 
consumers will be an increase in energy bills. 
The additional impact in 2020 of the policies 
in this plan is equivalent to a 6% increase on 
current household energy bills and a 15% 
increase on current business energy bills.

The Department of Energy and Climate Change will work with its delivery partners and wider stakeholders  
to ensure the commitments set out here are delivered effectively

These figures do not take account of the

costs of failing to tackle climate change.

The Government continues to seek to 
minimise the upward pressure on prices 
through policies to help households and 
businesses improve their energy efficiency. 
This is set out in chapters 4 and 5. 

To ensure transparency, accountability and 
value for money in costs associated with 
tackling climate change, the Department for 
Energy and Climate Change will report on 
the financial flows to tackle climate change 
through instruments which impose costs 
on energy bills, as required for National 
Accounts purposes. To ensure long-term 
certainty for investors while acknowledging 
the uncertainties associated with future 
technology costs and deployment rates, 
DECC will also undertake regular reviews 
of support levels across the range of levy 
mechanisms to support climate policy.

Chapters 3-7 look sector by sector to  
explain how carbon savings will be achieved 
and in doing so support security of energy 
supplies, economic opportunities and  
protect the most vulnerable.

The power and heavy industry sector will contribute over half of the additional savings

Currently three quarters of our electricity 
is generated using coal and gas. By 2050 
we may need to produce more electricity 
than we do today but must do so largely 
without emitting greenhouse gases. So we 
will need to transform our system so that 
electricity is generated from clean sources 
such as renewables, nuclear and fossil fuel 
plants fitted with carbon capture and storage 
technology. To support these changes, we will 
need an electricity grid with larger capacity 
and the ability to manage greater fluctuations 
in electricity demand and supply. To make this 
transition, the Government needs to maintain 

the right conditions for energy companies to 
invest very large sums in new power stations 
and in the transmission and distribution 
networks.

This Transition Plan, along with wider policies, 
will put us well on this path, with around 
40% of our electricity coming from these low 
carbon sources by 2020. It will cut emissions 
from the power sector and heavy industry by 
22% on 2008 levels by 2020.

At the heart of the Plan is the EU Emissions 
Trading System which sets a declining limit or 
‘cap’ for emissions. 

Summary




But this alone will not be enough to enable 
the rapid development and use of low carbon 
technologies. So the Government is taking 
further action:

Renewables: the Government is going 
further to support renewable technology 
by increasing financial incentives 
for renewables developers through 
the Renewables Obligation and the 
forthcoming clean energy cashback 
initiative. It is also streamlining the planning 
process, supporting innovation, speeding 
up grid connection and developing UK 
supply chains. To provide targeted support 
to UK businesses the Government is 
launching the Office for Renewable Energy 
Deployment. In addition, the Government 
is publishing a short list of Severn Tidal 
projects for further study.

Nuclear: the Government’s Office for 
Nuclear Development has made strong 
progress in facilitating the building of 
new nuclear power stations by energy 
companies, by taking action to streamline 
the planning and regulatory approvals 
processes for new nuclear power stations. 
The Government is currently assessing 
sites nominated by potential developers, 
to establish which are potentially suitable 
for the deployment of new nuclear 
power stations by the end of 2025. This 
assessment will be included in a draft 
National Policy Statement for nuclear 
power, which the Government will publish 
for consultation later in 2009.

Carbon capture and storage: in 2007 the 
Government launched a competition to 
build one of the first commercial scale 
carbon capture and storage demonstration 
projects in the world. In April 2009 the 
Government announced that new fossil 

fuel power stations would have to be 
designed and built so that they could 
fit CCS in the future. In a consultation 
launched in June 2009, the Government 
proposed a new financial and regulatory 
framework to drive the development of 
CCS. These proposals included plans to 
fund up to four CCS demonstrations in  
the UK and a requirement for any new  
coal power station to demonstrate CCS. 
The Department of Energy and Climate  
Change will also establish an Office of 
Carbon Capture and Storage to support  
the delivery of this work.

The Government is working with the 
regulator (Ofgem) and industry to increase 
grid capacity and to support development 
of new technologies which could enable 
the grid to work better in the future. The 
Government will later this year publish a high 
level vision setting out what a future smart 
grid could look like, linked to wider work on 
the roadmap to 2050 (see chapter 8).

The Government would like to see a smooth 
transition from the existing system to a 
new cleaner power sector. It expects the 
risks to security of electricity supply to 
be manageable over the next decade as 
new investment comes through to replace 
closing power stations. In the longer term, 
the Government will need to ensure that it 
maintains security of supply as low carbon 
technologies become increasingly important. 
Government plans to issue a call for evidence 
later in 2009 to seek views on these issues.

54 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The scale of the 
challenge
Three quarters of the electricity we use in 
our homes, businesses and public buildings 
is produced from coal and gas (as shown 
in chart 2). The way in which electricity is 
produced and supplied to us is described 
in box 1. But by 2050 the UK will need to 
produce very few greenhouse gas emissions 
overall. As set out in chapter 8, taking into 
account the costs and potential of all the 

options it is likely that we will need to  
reduce the emissions from the power  
sector to almost zero. 

To do this, we need to produce our electricity 
from low carbon technologies such as 
renewables, nuclear and fossil fuel fired 
generation fitted with carbon capture and 
storage technology. We also need a bigger, 
smarter electricity grid that is able  
to manage a more complex system of 
electricity supply and demand.

 Chapter 3: 55
 Transforming our power sector

The plan to 2020
The policies set out in this Transition Plan will 
help ensure we cut emissions from electricity 
and heavy industry by 22% on 2008 levels 
by 2020, and secure our electricity supplies. 
The private sector will be responsible for 
bringing forward the investment needed 
to deliver this change, but because of the 
importance of the task and the public policy 
choices involved, the Government will need 
to lead this change by setting out clear goals 
and an appropriate policy framework. The 
Government’s approach to decarbonising our 
electricity system is to apply a carbon price 
through the EU Emissions Trading System 
(EU ETS) (set out in more detail below), and 
to support the rapid development and use of 
low carbon technologies. Already, electricity 
generated from renewables has more than 
doubled in the last five years, and action is 
being taken to facilitate new nuclear power 
and the demonstration of carbon capture and 
storage, to reform the planning system and 

to review the process of connecting new 
generation to the electricity grid. 

But Government and private sector must 
together focus on delivery. The Department 
of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), has 
already piloted a new approach to delivering 
more proactive support to industry in the 
Office for Nuclear Development (OND), and 
the Government will be pursuing the same 
approach for renewables and carbon capture 
and storage, by setting up an Office for 
Renewable Energy Deployment (ORED)  
and an Office of Carbon Capture and  
Storage; all aim to remove barriers to vital 
investment, and make use of both private 
sector and regulatory expertise in carrying 
out their work.

The extent to which companies will build 
new power stations ultimately depends on 
the expected profitability of such investments 
which relies on the way in which they  
believe factors such as fossil fuel, carbon  
and electricity prices, technology costs  

Box 1
Electricity production and supply

Electricity is generated by privately 
owned companies operating in a 
competitive market within the policy 
framework set out by the Government. 
The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets 
(Ofgem) has responsibility for ensuring 
effective competition and enforcing 
regulation in the energy market while 
the Government’s policy framework is 
set to achieve public policy goals such 
as tackling climate change.

 Most electricity is produced in power 
stations which burn fossil fuels (coal,  
oil or natural gas) or use nuclear energy. 
A small, but increasing amount of our 
electricity is generated in other places 
such as wind farms. 

Three Transmission Owners (National 
Grid in England and Wales and SP 
Transmission Limited and Scottish 
Hydro-Electric Transmission Limited in 
Scotland) and 14 Distribution Network 
Operators construct and operate the 
electricity grid under licence from 
Ofgem which allows electricity to flow 
from where it is produced to where it 
is needed. National Grid also acts as 
‘system operator’ ensuring the amount 
of electricity produced and consumed  
is balanced second-by-second. 
Consumers then buy their electricity 
from electricity suppliers; these are  
also private companies.




56 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

and regulatory or planning risks will evolve  
over time.

So in taking action, the Government remains 
mindful of the need to provide as much 
clarity as possible in the market framework 
to enable private sector investment to come 
forward. The Department’s plan involves:

Incentivising the power sector to reduce 
emissions through the EU ETS

Taking action to make sure renewables, 
nuclear and carbon capture and storage 
can play their part

Putting the measures in place to create 
a bigger, smarter grid, ensuring fair and 
timely access

Using electricity more efficiently 

Keeping our electricity supplies safe 
and secure.


 

Putting the plan 
into practice

Incentivising the  
power sector to  
reduce emissions
The best way of incentivising the most cost 
effective mix of low carbon technologies is 
to put a limit or ‘cap’ on emissions. Since 
2005, the European Union Emissions Trading 
System (EU ETS) has set a declining cap on 
emissions from the large industrial sectors, 
including power. 

The EU ETS is the first multilateral carbon 
trading system of its scale, anywhere in the 
world, and is expected to account for over 
65% of the emissions savings in Europe by 
2020.2 It will reduce Europe’s emissions by  
around 500 million tonnes in 2020, which is 
about the same as the UK’s carbon dioxide 
emissions this year.

2.  Other countries, such as the United States and Australia, are developing similar ‘cap and trade’ systems, which may link to the EU ETS in the 
future, making it a cornerstone of a global carbon trading system. 




 Chapter 3: 57
 Transforming our power sector

3.  From 2012 aviation emissions will also be included in the EU ETS (see chapter 6).

The EU ETS is the single most important 
policy to reduce UK emissions (covering 
about half of the UK’s carbon dioxide 
emissions) and is expected to deliver 
emissions reductions from the power sector 
and heavy industry of 22% on 2008 levels 
by 2020 – underpinning the transition to low 
carbon electricity generation (see chart 3). 

It tackles emissions from large sources such 
as electricity generation and heavy industry;3 
it also allows the companies involved to trade 
the right to emit with each other, creating 
a carbon price and enabling emissions cuts 
to be made where they are cheapest. As 
the carbon price generated by the EU ETS 
increases, it makes producing electricity 
from high carbon power stations less and 
less attractive and creates an incentive for 
power station operators to invest in cleaner 
electricity generation (see box 2).

The EU ETS and other policies to bring 
forward low carbon technologies – set out 
below – put us on track to decarbonise the 
UK’s electricity system by around 40%  
by 2020. There will need to be significant 
further change in the period beyond 2020. 
Chapter 8 (2050) sets out the possible 
trajectories for reducing power sector 
emissions further. The Government is 
planning for an ambitious global deal to 
reduce global emissions at Copenhagen, 
which will mean the EU acting to reduce its 
emissions by 30% by 2020. This will lead to a 
significant tightening of the EU ETS cap and 
a system where all companies pay for their 
emissions and a guarantee that most  
of these reductions take place in the EU.

Box 2
What is a ‘carbon trading system’?

A carbon trading system, like EU ETS, 
places a cap on the total emissions of 
participants, divides that cap into rights 
to emit or ‘allowances’, and allows 
participants to trade those allowances. 

Each participant must surrender 
allowances proportional to the number 
of tonnes of carbon dioxide they emit. 
This encourages them to reduce their 
emissions if they can do so for less 
than the cost of allowances. Allowances 

are initially distributed either freely to 
participants, or through an auction. Once 
distributed allowances can be traded 
between participants. The trading of 
allowances gives them a value, or price, 
which is the same for all participants. 
This common price creates the same 
incentive for all participants to reduce 
their emissions which keeps the costs 
down by incentivising the least cost 
options to reduce emissions across the 
whole of the system.




58 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Box 3
New Single Consent Regime for Infrastructure and Infrastructure  
Planning Commission 

Introducing a carbon price as just described 
is critical to achieving clean electricity 
generation but it is not the complete answer. 
This is because other barriers exist to the 
development and deployment of innovative 
technologies such as high development 
costs, uncertainties around volatile fuel prices 
and technology costs and the lack of an 
effective supply chain. 

The Government looks forward to the first 
UK progress report from the Committee on 
Climate Change in October 2009, which will 
include details on the capability of the power 
sector in delivering decarbonisation at the 
pace required. 

Taking action to bring 
forward renewables, 
nuclear and carbon 
capture and storage 
There are some barriers which are common 
to all electricity generation technologies and 
the Government is taking action to remove 
them. However other barriers that need to  
be removed are specific to each technology 
or group of technologies. Renewable 
electricity, nuclear and carbon capture and 
storage will be needed in some combination, 
and the Government is therefore taking 
action to enable each one to contribute  
as part of the mix.

The Planning Act 2008 provides for 
a new independent Infrastructure 
Planning Commission to take decisions 
on nationally-significant energy 
infrastructure projects, and this will 
happen from 2010.

Following public consultation and 
Parliamentary scrutiny, Ministers will 
designate National Policy Statements 
(NPSs) for infrastructure development. 
These will set out the national need 
for energy infrastructure and other 
guidance on national policy that the 
IPC needs to consider when making 
decisions. Planning authorities, including 
responsible regional authorities 
preparing Regional Strategies, must 
have regard to these new NPSs when 

preparing development plans and, 
where relevant, when making planning 
decisions under the Town and Country 
Planning system. This will help ensure 
that decisions on renewables and other 
sectors, whether large or small, are 
taken consistently. The Government 
will publish the first of these NPSs for 
consultation later this year.

The new regime will provide three 
opportunities for communities and 
interest groups to have their say: 
during the public consultation on the 
NPSs; through local consultation at the 
pre-application stage; and, by making 
representations to the IPC when it 
considers an application.




 Chapter 3: 59
 Transforming our power sector

Supporting all generation 
technologies

The Government is undertaking major 
planning reform to ensure that planning 
supports the deployment of all electricity 
technologies (see box 3)

These changes will create greater clarity and 
predictability in the planning framework for 
nationally significant energy infrastructure 
and better opportunities for the public to 
engage with the process, with increased 
transparency and accountability for decisions.

The Government is also taking action to help 
ensure that high-quality forward-looking 
information is available. Investments in new 
infrastructure will be informed by views of 
future changes in energy prices and demand. 
Through the Energy Markets Outlook, the 
Government provides information that 
potential investors may find helpful in taking 
decisions on energy infrastructure.

The Government is improving the way it 
supports technology innovation which will 
affect all low carbon power technologies. 
Further details are set out in chapter 5.

Renewable power

Delivering large increases in renewable 
electricity will be critical in decarbonising the 
power sector. However generating electricity 
using renewables still costs more than fossil 
fuel generation and deployment is hampered 
by a range of barriers such as access to 
transmission capacity and lack of an effective 
supply chain. 

The Government has already made progress 
in removing these barriers and is publishing 
the UK’s Renewable Energy Strategy (2009), 
alongside this document. This sets out 
how the UK will increase its energy from 
renewable sources almost seven-fold, and 
the role of the electricity sector  
in contributing to this.

Box 4
The Renewables Obligation provides financial incentives for renewable 
electricity generation

The Renewable Obligation provides 
a financial incentive to invest in 
renewables by placing an obligation on 
electricity suppliers to source a certain 
proportion of the electricity they sell to 
customers from renewable sources. 

Renewable energy generators receive 
Certificates, known as Renewables 
Obligation Certificates (ROCs) for the 
renewable electricity they produce, 
and can then sell these to electricity 
suppliers, who use them to meet their 
obligations.

They demonstrate this by submitting 
the ROCs they have bought. If they are 
unable to present ROCs for the whole of 

the specified amount of electricity, they 
have to pay a penalty. These payments 
are redistributed to suppliers who did 
present ROCs. It is this redistribution that 
provides the incentive for suppliers to 
present ROCs rather than simply paying 
the buy-out price. 

ROCs can be sold with or without the 
electricity they represent, meaning that 
they provide generators with financial 
support above what they receive from 
selling their electricity in the wholesale 
market. Different technologies receive 
different numbers of ROCs, to account 
for differences in technology costs.




60 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Around 30% of our electricity is expected to 
come from renewables by 2020; highlights of 
how this will be achieved are outlined below. 

Ensuring large scale renewable power 

makes financial sense

To ensure that investing in renewables  
makes financial sense for investors and  
help bring down the costs of renewables 
in the future, in 2002 the Government 
introduced the Renewables Obligation  
(RO) (see box 4 above).

Since the RO was introduced, renewable 
electricity generation has tripled from less 
than 1.8% in 2002 to around 5.3% in 2008. 
The UK is now number one in the world for 
installed offshore wind capacity. The wind 
farms under construction today and those 
awaiting construction will together produce 
enough electricity for another 5.5 million  
UK homes.

 Chapter 3: 61
 Transforming our power sector

By 2010 the RO along with exemption from 
the Climate Change Levy (see chapter 5) 
will be worth around £1 billion a year to the 
renewable electricity industry. However 
we need to do more if the UK is to further 
increase the levels of renewable electricity:

In November 2008, the Government 
confirmed that the RO will be retained 
and extended from 2027 to at least 2037, 
therefore giving certainty to investors 
about long-term support for investment  
in renewable generation.4 

In April 2009, the Government  
announced that it would be reviewing 
the level of support to offshore wind to 
determine whether it should be increased. 
In total it expects up to 3 GW of planned 
projects could benefit from any increase in 
support – enough to power an estimated  
2 million homes.

Improving grid connection

The Government is delivering a new strategic 
approach to investment in the grid both 
onshore and offshore, and speeding up 
access arrangements, so that renewable, 
new nuclear and other low carbon generation 
can connect to the grid when it needs 
(further detail set out below). 

Ensuring planning supports 

renewables deployment

As set out above, the planning system 
will need to play a central role in 
supporting the deployment of renewable 
energy. Improvements to the system are 
already being made with the provisions  
in the Planning Act 2008, which creates  
a new system of development consent 
for nationally significant infrastructure 
projects with the Infrastructure Planning 
Commission taking decisions on larger 
renewable projects including large wind-
farms in England and Wales (over 100  
MW offshore or 50 MW onshore).

But further action is needed at regional and 
local level to ensure projects below these 
thresholds are also supported whilst ensuring 
development takes place in appropriate 
places, at the right time, and in a way that 
gives business the confidence to invest.  The 
UK Renewable Energy Strategy (2009) also 
sets out reforms to the Town and Country 
Planning system which are designed to 
deliver a more effective, transparent and 
responsive system in England. This includes 
a package of measures designed to support 
more effective and proactive planning by 
local and regional authorities so that they are 
better able to capitalise on the renewable 
opportunities available to them. 

Of course, there will always be locations 
where new infrastructure will not be 
appropriate and the Government will  
continue to apply higher planning tests in 
National Parks and Areas of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty.

Developing the renewables  

supply chain

The Government wants to maximise the 
economic and employment opportunities 
for Britain in expanding renewable sources 
of energy, putting us at the forefront of 
global competition in the low carbon 
economy.  The UK must make the most of 
its strengths as one of the world’s largest 
manufacturing economies, as a world 
class centre of expertise and as a leading 
location for inward investment. The increase 
in deployment of renewables both here 
and in other countries has highlighted the 
bottlenecks and constraints in the supply 
chain.  The Government needs to ensure 
that the renewables industry and its supply 
chain can deliver the unparalleled deployment 
required.  Further rapid growth will depend 
on more investment in innovation and 
manufacturing, the availability of skills, 
and the development of infrastructure  
such as ports and construction vessels  
for offshore deployment.

To deliver this support, the Government 
has launched the Office for Renewable 
Energy Deployment. The Office, part of the 
Department of Energy and Climate Change, 
will have the objective of significantly 
ramping up renewables deployment, by 
addressing delivery issues across a range of 
renewable energy technologies with a strong 
emphasis on facilitating investment and 
supporting the supply chain to maximise the 
economic opportunity presented by the UK 
renewables target. 

Exploring untapped resources

The Government is undertaking work to 
explore the potential of untapped renewable 
sources, including the Severn Estuary – see 
box 5 for further details

Nuclear power 

In January 2008, following consultation, the 
Government published its White Paper on 
Nuclear Power.4 The White Paper sets out 
the Government’s view that nuclear power 
is low carbon, affordable, dependable, safe 
and capable of increasing diversity of energy 
supply. The White Paper also explains the 
Government’s belief that new nuclear power 

Box 5
Could we generate power from the Severn Estuary? 

The Severn Estuary has one of the 
largest tidal ranges in the world – a 
difference of about 14 metres between 
high and low tide. This could be 
harnessed to provide a long-term  
supply of electricity – up to 5% of 
the UK’s supply – and could make an 
important contribution to delivering 
our renewable energy and climate 

change targets. But, as well as huge 
potential, a scheme in the Severn also 
has drawbacks including its costs and 
impacts on the natural environment. 

The Government is investigating these 
issues, and after public consultation in 
2010, will decide whether to support a 
scheme in the Severn. A full planning 
process would follow a decision to go 
ahead. The potential for new innovative 
technologies is also being considered 
and the Government will consider the 
potential of new technology options 
before taking decisions on Severn  
tidal power. 

Alongside this Transition Plan, the 
Government published a shortlist of 
schemes under consideration – including 
several options for barrages and 
impounded areas within the Estuary, 
and which innovative technologies will 
receive funding. 

The Severn Estuary




 Chapter 3: 63
 Transforming our power sector

stations should have a role to play in this 
country’s future energy mix alongside other 
low carbon sources; that it would be in the 
public interest to allow energy companies 
the option of investing in new nuclear power 
stations; and that the Government should 
take active steps to facilitate this.

Nuclear power is a proven technology, and it 
will be for energy companies to fund, develop 
and build new nuclear power stations  
in the UK, including meeting the full  
costs of decommissioning and their full  
share of waste management and disposal 
costs. However, the Government has a 
strategic role in removing unnecessary 
obstacles to the development of new  
nuclear power stations.

Since the White Paper on Nuclear Power, 
the Office for Nuclear Development, part 
of the Department of Energy and Climate 
Change, has made good progress in helping 
to facilitate nuclear new build: 

The Government is running a Strategic 
Siting Assessment to establish which 

sites in England and Wales are potentially 
suitable for the deployment of new nuclear 
power stations by the end of 2025. A list 
of potentially suitable sites will be included 
in a draft National Policy Statement for 
nuclear power, which will be published for 
consultation later this year (see below). 

The Government has legislated in the 
Energy Act 2008 to ensure that operators 
of new nuclear power stations will have 
secure financing arrangements in place to 
meet the full costs of decommissioning 
and their full share of waste management 
and disposal costs. 

The Government is running a process 
of Regulatory Justification to meet the 
requirement of European law under which 
Member States must make an assessment 
to ensure that the benefits of a new 
class or type of practice involving ionising 
radiation outweigh any detriments to 
health. The Government will be consulting 
on the Secretary of State’s proposed 
decisions on this later in 2009. 

Box 6
Safety and security of nuclear power 

The UK has strict, independent, safety 
and environment protection regimes for 
nuclear power. Any new nuclear power 
station will be subject to safety licensing 
conditions and will have to comply with 
the safety and environmental conditions 
set by the regulators. Statutory 
obligations require that radiation 
exposures not only comply with dose 
limits but are as low as reasonably 
achievable. The security of civil nuclear 
material and sites is regulated by the 
Office of Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS). 
OCNS ensures that security measures 
are included in plans for the construction 
of any new nuclear power station from 
the outset.

Having reviewed the evidence and 
arguments, and based on the advice 
of the independent regulators, and 
the advances in the designs of power 
stations that might be proposed by 
energy companies, the Government 
believes that new nuclear power  
stations would pose very small risks  
to safety, security, health and 
proliferation. The Government also 
believes that the UK has an effective 
regulatory framework that ensures that 
these risks are minimised and sensibly 
managed by industry.




64 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The Government is working to ensure that 
the nuclear regulators continue to have the 
resources and tools necessary to assess 
the safety, security and environmental 
impacts of new nuclear reactor designs 
through the Generic Design Assessment 
process by June 2011. 

In addition, the Government launched a 
consultation in June 2009 on proposals 
to enhance the transparency and 
accountability of nuclear regulation, 
creating a regulator with the autonomy and 
flexibility needed to meet challenges of the 
changing nuclear environment.

As set out in this plan, in order to 
decarbonise, our electricity supply will  
need to come from a mix including 
renewable sources, nuclear power and 
fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage. 
The draft National Policy Statement (NPS) 
for nuclear power, which the Government 
is publishing for public consultation and 
Parliamentary scrutiny later this year, will 
set out in more detail why the Government 
considers there is an early need for nuclear 
power as part of this mix. 

The new Infrastructure Planning Commission, 
when set up, would use the NPS to help it 
make decisions about applications to develop 
new nuclear power stations on particular 
sites. This would allow for the earliest 
possible deployment of new nuclear  
power stations. 

The action taken so far has resulted in 
real interest in new nuclear in the UK with 
energy companies announcing plans to build 
over 12 GW of new nuclear capacity. The 
Government is committed to enabling nuclear 
new build as soon as possible, and envisages 
the first new nuclear power stations 
operating from around 2018, but will look to 
accelerate timescales where possible.

The Office for Nuclear Development will 
continue to work with industry and others to 
meet new nuclear skills requirements and 
to develop a globally competitive UK supply 
chain, focusing on high value added activities 
to take advantage of the UK and worldwide 
nuclear new build programme.

The Government is also taking action to deal 
with our old nuclear facilities effectively and 
responsibly. The Government created the 

Nuclear is part of the future




 Chapter 3: 65
 Transforming our power sector

Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) 
to ensure that civil public sector nuclear sites 
are decommissioned and cleaned up safely, 
securely, cost effectively and in ways that 
protect the environment and is funding the 
largest ever amount of expenditure on the UK 
civil nuclear clean-up programme. 

In its first four years the NDA has made 
significant progress. For the first time there 
is a single body with responsibility for an ever 
improving understanding of the UK’s nuclear 
liabilities and good progress has been made 
on decommissioning, with the focus being 
on tackling the highest hazards, particularly  
at Sellafield.

Clean fossil fuels through 
carbon capture and storage 

Coal and gas will remain important to ensure 
our electricity supply is reliable and secure 
as we move towards a greater dependence 
on intermittent renewable sources like wind. 
However, coal power stations have higher 
carbon emissions for a unit of electricity than 

any other fuel and they can only remain part 
of our energy mix if they can be part of a 
low carbon future. There is the prospect of 
a solution to the challenge – carbon capture 
and storage (CCS) – which has the potential 
to reduce emissions from fossil fuel power 
stations by up to 90%.

Carbon capture and storage is the capture of 


CO2

 from large point sources such as, power 

stations and other industrial installations, 
transporting it and storing it underground. 
There are different ways of doing this – it is 
not one single technology.

One of the biggest challenges with this 
technology is that while each stage – 
capture, storage and transport – has been 
shown to work, CCS has never been tried 
at a commercial scale on a power station 
and never the complete process from start 
to finish. Action is therefore needed to 
demonstrate the technology at commercial 
scale, whilst ensuring the UK is prepared for 
its eventual deployment.

Box 7
Managing the waste from new nuclear power stations

The Government is aware of the  
need to manage radioactive waste 
effectively and particularly the need to 
make progress towards a long-term 
disposal solution.

In June 2008 the Government published 
the White Paper on Managing 
Radioactive Waste Safely. This sets the 
framework for managing higher activity 
radioactive waste in the long term 
through geological disposal, coupled 
with safe and secure interim storage 
and ongoing research and development. 
It also invites communities to express 
an interest in opening up without 

commitment discussions with 
Government on the possibility of  
hosting a geological disposal facility  
at some point in the future.

As was made clear in the White Paper 
on Nuclear Power, our policy is that, 
before development consents for new 
nuclear power stations are granted, the 
Government will need to be satisfied 
that effective arrangements exist or 
will exist to manage and dispose 
of the waste they will produce. The 
Government currently expects to set out 
its view on this in the National Policy 
Statement for nuclear power.




66 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The UK is leading international efforts to 
develop CCS and, in 2007, we were one of 
the first countries to launch a commercial 
scale CCS demonstration project. In April 
2009 the Government confirmed that subject 
to receiving suitable bids and being able 
to reach appropriate terms, it remains the 
Government’s intention to proceed with 
the current competition to contract award. 
As with any long-term procurement, final 
funding approval for this will depend on 
decisions taken at the next Government 
Spending Review. The Government also 
announced public funding for the next stage 
of the competition and bids are now being 
selected to proceed with this stage. The 
Government confirmed all new combustion 
power stations over 300 MW in England and 
Wales would have to be designed and built 
“carbon capture ready” i.e. so that they could 
fit CCS. This will minimise the barriers to 
deployment of CCS once the technology 
has been proven. 

But if we are to see CCS ready for 
commercial deployment from 2020, we need 
to go further. In April 2009, the Government 
also set out proposals for an ambitious 
new financial and regulatory framework 
for the development of carbon capture 
technology, followed by publication of a 
formal consultation in June, which closes 
on 9 September. The consultation sets out, 
and seeks views on, proposals to drive the 
development of clean coal by: 

Providing financial support for up to four 
commercial-scale CCS demonstrations in 
Britain covering a range of CCS technologies 
including for example pre and post 
combustion capture. 

Requiring any new coal power station in 
England and Wales to demonstrate CCS  
on a defined part of its capacity: at least  
300 MW net (around 400 MW gross).

Requiring new coal power stations to 
retrofit CCS to their full capacity within five 
years of CCS being independently judged 
technically and economically proven. The 
Government will plan on the basis that 
CCS will be proven by 2020. 

Preparing for the possibility that CCS 
will not become proven as early as the 
Government expects.

The Government is focusing further actions 
on coal-fired power stations because 
the emissions per unit of electricity are 
substantially higher than from gas; these 
higher emissions mean that tackling coal 
first makes the most economic sense; and 
the projected increases in coal use globally 
create a greater sense of urgency to tackling 
emissions from coal. However, all gas plants 
(over 300 MW) will in future be built ready 
to fit the technology in order to facilitate its 
deployment once it has been proven.

Low carbon coal technologies represent 
a major future market for UK business 
estimated to be worth of the order of £2-4 
billion to the UK by 2030, sustaining 30,000 - 
60,000 jobs.5

The Government is considering how to 
encourage clusters of CCS infrastructure 
and expertise, in key areas, such as Yorkshire 
and Humber, the Thames Estuary, the 
Firth of Forth, Tyne/ Tees and Merseyside, 
bringing major employment and regeneration 
benefits. 

Working with other countries to develop 
CCS will be critical to developing and proving 
the technology because a large number and 
range of commercial scale demonstration 
projects will be needed globally to meet 
our climate change goals. The International 
Energy Agency’s Technology Roadmap for 
CCS envisages 30 will be needed globally  
by 2020. Details about international action  
in this area are set out in Box 9.

Box 8
Office of Carbon Capture and Storage

CCS is a crucial part of the solution to climate 
change, in the UK and globally. It also offers 
an opportunity to create a new industry in 
capturing and storing carbon. 

The UK is well placed to lead the way because 
the North Sea offers many potentially 
suitable sites for carbon storage. And it is 
possible to envisage a future in which there 
are geographic clusters of carbon capture, 
in areas like the Thames Gateway, 
Humberside, the Firth of Forth, Merseyside 
and Tyne/Teesside, based around pipelines 
transporting carbon dioxide to storage 
under the North and Irish Seas. The UK has 
the basics from which to build a CCS 
industry, from strong clean coal research 
and development expertise through a long 
tradition of fossil fuel power generation to 
the skills and experience of working with 
hydrocarbons on and offshore. 

The UK is also home to the engineering and 
project management expertise needed to 
integrate the CCS chain of capture, transport 
and storage, and the financial and legal 

expertise to pull projects together. It is the 
job of Government to enable this future to 
become reality, helping to develop an 
integrated capability to take forward these 
very major projects at home and overseas. 

The measures proposed in the recent 
consultation document, published on 17 
June, to support up to four demonstration 
plants are a start. But they need to be the 
start of a road to deploying CCS technology 
at scale, so creating the new industry of the 
future. So the Department of Energy and 
Climate Change now intend to establish an 
Office of Carbon Capture and Storage 
(“OCCS”) within the Department to make 
this happen, in the same way that it has 
created an Office for Nuclear Development 
and an Office Renewable Energy 
Deployment. 

The first step will be to consult with 
stakeholders on the objectives, functions 
and tasks of the OCCS. The Department will 
aim to announce further details of the new 
Office in the autumn.

from fossil fuels, and storing them underground. British Geological Survey (2008)




68 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Taking action to create 
a bigger, smarter grid 
Whatever combination of technologies exists 
from now to 2050, we will need a smarter, 
more flexible grid that will be able to manage 
electricity generated from new technologies 
and respond to changes in energy demand. 
In the shorter term the Government needs 
to ensure that the grid is able to respond to 
the pressures for connecting the new power 
stations under construction in a timely way. 

More investment in the existing grid 

The UK network needs expansion to 
connect the new sources of generation the 
Government needs to meet our carbon and 
energy goals in 2020. Ofgem has approved 
£4-5 billion of refurbishment and expansion 
plans to ensure the grid is capable of 
supplying current and future electricity to our 
homes, businesses and industry in the next 
few years. The Government is developing 

a Grid National Policy Statement and will 
publish it for consultation later this year. 

Looking towards 2020, the DECC-Ofgem co-
chaired industry group: Electricity Networks 
Strategy Group (ENSG) has produced a vision 
for network investments the Government 
needs to meet 2020 renewables and 
energy targets. The ENSG found that an 
additional £4.7 billion was needed to develop 
the onshore grid to support connection 
of up to 35 GW of renewable generation 
coming forward by 2020 and accommodate 
increased flows of electricity across the 
network. This work presented a consensus 
view of the strategic investments that are 
required under different scenarios and an 
agreed plan to deliver these investments 
ahead of requests by generators for a grid 
connection. Ofgem has approved up to £43 
million of pre-construction work on projects 
identified in the ENSG vision and by summer 
2010 will finalise new incentives for network 

Box 9
The UK is working internationally to develop carbon capture and storage

  The UK is working with EU partners 
to develop CCS and in December 
2008 was instrumental in reaching 
agreement that allowances from the 
EU Emissions Trading System should 
be used to support the EU’s ambition 
to have 12 demonstration projects by 
2015. Further support for CCS projects 
in seven EU member states was 
agreed in April 2009.

 In July 2008, the G8 leaders 
announced that “we strongly support 
the launching of 20 large scale CCS 
demonstration projects globally by 
2010, taking into account various 
national circumstances, with a view 
to beginning broad deployment of 

CCS by 2020”. The UK will be seeking 
concrete progress this year on this 
commitment.

 The UK has also played a key role  
in the development of the EU-China 
Near Zero Emissions Coal Initiative  
to demonstrate commercial scale  
CCS in China. 

 To facilitate international progress 
on CCS, the UK is co-hosting with 
Norway the Carbon Sequestration 
Leadership Forum Ministerial meeting 
on 12-13 October 2009 in London, 
where Ministers and CEOs from 
around the world will convene to 
agree steps to bring forward the 
commercialisation of CCS.




 Chapter 3: 69
 Transforming our power sector

companies to build the new lines necessary 
to meet 2020 targets. 

The Government also needs to consider now 
how to plan for network investment beyond 
2020. As set out in Chapter 8, Government 
is considering what further actions are 
necessary in shaping the long term path 
to meeting our energy and carbon policy 
objectives. A key element of the future 
energy system is the network infrastructure 
required to support and match the demand 
for and supply of electricity.

This includes how the Government should 
work with the regulator and in consultation 
with the industry to develop a long term 
vision for the network, including the 
investments that would help contribute to 
the Government’s policy objectives. Part 
of the Government’s considerations will 
include how best to underpin this vision and 
how all parties can report progress on their 
contribution to the delivery of the vision. This 
work will address questions about the scale 
of the investment required; the prioritisation 
of investment; and the investment needed to 
produce a smarter grid capability, consistent 
with the interests of consumers today and in 
the future.

Setting the right incentives framework for 
network companies will also help deliver 
networks which are fit for purpose.  
Through the next electricity distribution price 
control to be set from April 2010, Ofgem is 
looking to expand funding for innovation and 
to get the networks ready for the challenges 
of the low carbon future such as more local 
generation. In addition, Ofgem’s RPI@20 
project will report in summer 2010. This 
comprehensive review covers all networks 
to make sure the regulatory framework is 
capable of delivering the networks needed 
for a low carbon economy.

Quicker and fairer connection  

to the grid

Timely and effective reforms of the grid 
access regime are essential to speed up 
the connection of new generation and to 
ensure security of supply. A new grid access 
regime is required which is consistent with 
the Government’s policy goals for meeting 
the renewable energy target in 2020, as 
well as its broader energy policy objectives. 
The Government therefore took powers 
in the Energy Act 2008 to implement new 
grid access rules if the industry grid access 
reform process did not deliver as quickly  
as needed. 

Having considered industry submitted 
proposals for enduring grid access reform, 
Government has decided to use the 
Energy Act 2008 powers to implement 

Offshore wind farms will be part of the  
future electricity supply




70 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

enduring reform of the transmission 
access arrangements. The Government has 
considered the industry proposals and the 
advice of Ofgem on the best way forward. 
The Government’s key considerations have 
been the extent to which the proposals 
add certainty for developers, speed up 
connections, and ensure the efficient 
operation of existing plant. The risks to 
current and future consumers of grid access 
reform have been considered in relation 
to the impact on the required generation 
investment, and other Government policy 
goals, and the costs of the possible options.

The Government has decided to use the 
powers taken in the Energy Act 2008 to 

introduce the necessary reforms. To make 
progress in the short term, the Government 
has also taken urgent steps - with Ofgem, 
National Grid and industry - to ensure that 
ready to go projects can connect at the 
earliest possible date. This has successfully 
resulted in around 1 GW of renewable 
projects receiving earlier connection offers –  
enough to power 600,000 homes. 

Investment in a new offshore grid

The Government and Ofgem have developed 
a new regulatory framework for offshore 
electricity transmission to provide clear, cost 
effective and co-ordinated delivery of £15 
billion worth of grid connections needed for

consumers, notably through smart 
meters, to allow them to manage their 
energy use (and hence energy bills) 
more effectively.

   Facilitating demand management, 
providing data to technologies 
in homes and buildings that 
can regulate electricity use (e.g. 
encouraging electric cars to recharge 
when there is “surplus electricity” 
available on the system). 

   Enabling individuals and businesses 
to sell electricity into the network 
as well as buying from it, through 
microgeneration and on-site 
technologies.

   Enhanced monitoring and information 
flows for network operators, allowing 
them to make more efficient decisions 
about where energy flows across the 
network on a real time basis. This 
is likely to be particularly important 

with increasing levels of intermittent 
renewable generation on the system. 
A greater use of energy storage 
would also increase the need for 
smarter information flows for network 
operators on energy storage supply 
and timing of its use. 

   Use of a range of technologies 
including advanced communications

in large scale demonstrations and 
the actual mix that is deployed will 
depend on their feasibility.

radical offshore wind growth. This regime 
went active in June 2009.

A smarter grid for the future

By 2030 we will see a step change in 
intermittent generation delivered through 
both large and small scale renewable plants, 
more price responsive consumers enabled 
by the roll out of smart meters and possible 
increases in demand for electricity from 
structural changes in power use, such as a 
move to use of electric vehicles. 

In the long term the electricity grid will 
continue to need to develop in order to 
connect and integrate new technologies 
and enable even more active management 
of fluctuations in supply and demand than 
we experience today. To do this network 
operators could benefit from having more 
real time information on energy use and 
supply and network conditions and  
capability for more automated response  
to changes on the network. 

The Government has therefore started 
considering what a UK smart grid might look 
like in practice; possible key elements are set 
out in box 10.

The UK already has a grid capable of coping 
with fluctuations and balancing supply and 
demand. The key issue is developing this 
capability even further to cope with the 
evolving energy system to 2050 so that 
the grid is fit for purpose in the future. The 
Government is already working on key areas 
of smart networks to ensure it understands 
the benefits of smart grid technologies 
for meeting our goals and to encourage 
deployment in the coming years. Its 
programme currently consists of:

Smart meters: A programme to roll out 
smart meters to every home by end 2020 
– an £8bn private sector investment. This 
is one of the building blocks for creating a 
smart grid (see Chapter 4).

Deploying new technologies: Encouraging 
Distribution Network Operators through 
regulatory incentives to trial new ‘smarter’ 
technologies on their networks. Ofgem 
are proposing to significantly increase the 
amount of funding available for this.

Developing new technologies: Providing 
direct funding for innovation through the 
Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) which 
aims to invest up to £1bn over the next 10 
years in low carbon energy technologies, 
including networks.   The Government is 
engaging with the recently established 
ETI networks panel that is scoping the 
objectives they set for a call for projects.

Funding research: Providing direct 
funding, through the Research Councils, 
of over £30m for collaborative research in 
networks involving academia and industry. 
Providing complementary funding of £6m 
to supplement other funding for network 
innovation such as Ofgem’s Innovation 
Funding Incentive amongst other sources. 
Government funding for smart grids will be 
used to support early stage development 
of trials of key technologies consistent with 
a vision for a smart grid in the UK to be 
published later this year.

The costs and benefits of a smart grid  
will ultimately depend on the combinations 
of technologies that are brought together - 
some are well understood, some at an  
early stage of development, others do  
not yet exist.

The ENSG ‘smart grid working group’ are 
taking forward a study on smart grids in 
a UK context. The study will consider the 
costs, benefits and issues to be addressed in 
developing a smart grid for the UK electricity 
system, including technology readiness, how 
such a system might develop, and the drivers 
and barriers at each stage. 




72 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Following completion of this work the 
Government will publish:

A high level “vision” setting out what a  
UK smart grid might look like and why  
the Government would want to develop  
it later this year.

In the light of work on the 2050 energy 
roadmap next year, a ‘route map’ for 
delivery of this vision.

Using electricity more 
efficiently 
An effective way of reducing energy demand 
is through the introduction of minimum 
energy efficiency standards for new products 
on sale. European Union countries agree 
the rules on minimum energy efficiency 
standards for products such as white goods 
and televisions; and the information available 
to consumers, such as the ‘A-G’ energy label 
rating. These minimum standards mean that 
the products which waste the most energy 
are taken off the shelves. 

The Government is pushing to achieve more, 
and extend the ambition set out in the 2007 
Energy White Paper, with the aim of doubling 
the emissions savings expected by the 
measures agreed so far, by 2020. To achieve 
this, Government will continue to work hard 
in Europe in the next two years to ensure 
that new standards are brought forward.6

 The minimum standards agreed so far in 
Europe are expected to save £900 million 
per year from people’s energy bills and help 
save around 7 MtCO2 per annum by 2020. In 
the UK, the Government has also introduced 
a voluntary initiative to bring forward the 
phase-out of energy-wasting incandescent 
light bulbs by 2011, ahead of EU legislation.

Keeping our electricity 
supplies safe and secure
To date, our electricity system has given us 
an extremely reliable supply, with the average 
consumer in the UK spending less than an 
hour and a half without power in a year. 
It is critical that the UK continues to have 
secure and reliable supplies of electricity 
as we make the transition to a low carbon 
economy. However, the scale and pace of 
the transformation that we expect to see in 
the electricity sector means that we need to 
be alert to new challenges to our electricity 
security of supply as we make this transition.

The Government’s Updated Energy 
Projections suggest that demand for 
centrally generated electricity will be lower 
over the next decade compared to today 
given the combined impact of our energy 
efficiency policies, the increase in small scale 
generation and the economic downturn. 
However, it is possible that beyond this 
electricity demand could be significantly 
higher, for example we may use electricity  
for transport or to heat our homes. 

Ensuring security of supply during  
our transformation to lower carbon  
electricity is a particular challenge because 
of the lead times for building new power 
stations and the requirement for significant 
capital investment. 

To deliver secure supplies of electricity  
requires:

a supportive climate for timely 
investment in a diverse mix of low carbon 
technologies; and

a market and regulatory framework  
that can adapt to the different 
characteristics of low carbon  
electricity generation technologies.

 6.  The analysis in this plan does not take account of this potential additional abatement which the Government will consult on later this year.




 Chapter 3: 73
 Transforming our power sector

Outlook to 2020

Around sixteen power stations representing 
approximately 25% (18 GW) of our electricity 
generating capacity are scheduled to close 
by 2018. Significant new investment is 
needed to replace them and to ensure a 
healthy margin of spare electricity generation 
capacity, and latest figures show the market 
is responding to this need with over 20 
GW of investment under construction or 
with planning consent. These investments 
comprise the following:

The construction of 2 GW of generating 
capacity that has recently been completed 
and will be commissioned this year.

8 GW of new generating capacity that is 
currently under construction 

An additional 10.5 GW that has both 
planning consent and agreement to 
connect to the grid

A further 7.5 GW that has applied for 
planning consent in England and Wales

74 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Chart 5 shows the overall impact of these 
changes on electricity supply, compared to 
the National Grid’s projection of demand. 

Beyond the middle of the next decade, 
further closures will be driven by the EU’s 
Industrial Emissions (Integrated Pollution 
Prevention and Control) Directive, which 
will replace the regulatory framework 
established by the EU’s Large Combustion 
Plants Directive and sets stricter limits on 
the emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxide. 
The Government believes that the position 
reached at the Environment Council in June 
2009 would enable us to manage the risks 
that these further closures could pose to 
security of electricity supplies while allowing 
a smooth transition to a system of low 
carbon generation. The Directive now needs 
to be agreed by the European Parliament 
before it becomes law. 

A diverse mix of low carbon 
technologies

A diverse mix of low carbon technologies 
helps deliver energy security by reducing 
the risk of problems that may arise with one 
type of technology or fuel. The challenge 
is to ensure that these technologies, each 
of which has different characteristics, can 
operate together to provide reliable secure 
supplies of electricity. 

A significant share of our future electricity 
supply is likely to be generated from 
renewable sources (e.g. wind and tidal).  
Wind generation, which is likely to provide 
most of our renewable generation in 2020, 
is both intermittent and unpredictable; so 
we will need power stations whose output 
can be flexed at short notice to ensure that 
demand can be met during periods when  
the wind is not blowing.

As the output of nuclear power stations is 
relatively inflexible, in the medium term this 
flexibility is likely to be provided by fossil 
fuel fired power stations. Fossil fuel fired 
power stations are able to quickly change the 
amount of electricity they generate and this 
flexibility can be used to ensure a reliable  
and predictable total supply of electricity to 
meet demand. 

Longer term there are a number of options 
for making our electricity system more 
flexible, while at the same time ensuring a 
shift to low carbon supplies, including: coal 
and gas fired power stations with carbon 
capture and storage; greater interconnection; 
more storage capacity; and greater flexibility 
in electricity demand, which could be 
provided by active management of new 
sources of electricity demand such as  
electric cars. 

Renewable electricity can be generated from

8. ‘Operating the Electricity Transmission Networks in 2020’

A supportive climate  
for investment

To ensure secure supplies while reducing 
power sector emissions we will need a 
market and regulatory framework that 
supports investment in increasingly low 
carbon generation with sufficient flexibility. 
Factors affecting power station investment 
decisions include expected fossil fuel, carbon 
and electricity prices. Fossil fuel prices are 
influenced by international markets, while 
the Government sets the framework which 
delivers a price for carbon through the EU 
Emissions Trading Scheme. The growth of 
renewable electricity is expected to make 
future electricity prices more volatile –  
see box 1. 

Higher wholesale prices for electricity at 
times of peak demand will be important in 
providing sufficient returns for investors in 
the flexible power stations. These stations 
might be expected to operate for a limited 
number of hours per year when renewable 
electricity generation is not available. So 
these investors will need to be confident that 
prices will reach sufficiently high levels on a 
sufficient number of occasions to allow them 
to recover their costs. 

Our analysis suggests that we will see 
sufficient investment in flexible back up 
generation to ensure secure supplies  
so long as investors expect prices to  
accurately reflect the value of providing  
this flexible capacity.

National Grid’s recent consultation8 sets out 
their view that a number of changes to the 
technical operation of the supply and demand 
balancing arrangements might be necessary 
in the period to 2020 in part to manage the 
intermittency of renewables supplies. There 
would need to be greater reserve capacity, 
but they did not consider that fundamental 
change was required. 

The Government believes that the risks to 
electricity security of supply are manageable 
to 2020 given its assessment of:

future power station closures, the 
investments coming forward and future 
electricity demand, and

the implications for electricity security  
of supply from the increase in intermittent 
wind generation delivered by the 
Government’s Renewable Energy  
Strategy (2009).

However, the Government recognises that 
the scale and pace of change needed will 
test our market during the transition to a 
low carbon economy and some issues may 
need to be considered further. For example, 

Box 11
How renewable electricity affects 
wholesale electricity prices

Increased levels of renewable 
electricity generation are likely to 
change the shape of electricity prices. 
Independent analysis7 suggests that 
the volatility of spot prices is likely to 
increase as a result of wind generation. 
The analysis shows that wholesale 
prices may fluctuate from levels which 
are sometimes negative (due to wind 
generation bidding at its opportunity 
cost of -1 ROC) to above £1,000/MWh. 
The probability of lower and negative 
prices is likely to increase as well as 
the probability of higher peak prices so 
that on average wholesale electricity 
prices and hence retail prices will not 
necessarily increase. The analysis 
also suggests that this volatility could 
dramatically increase by 2030. By 
comparison, spot prices reached a  
high of around £500/MWh last year 
(the Analytical Annex provides 
additional details). 




76 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

the amount of renewable electricity on the 
system could potentially become a problem 
after 2020 due to the closure of the older 
gas and coal power stations which provide 
valuable flexibility to the electricity system. 

There may also be impacts on other forms 
of low carbon generation (including nuclear 
and CCS); if investors expect future electricity 
prices to be more volatile this could increase 
their uncertainty over the expected returns 
from investing in these technologies.

The Government will need to be vigilant to 
ensure that the market framework works 
effectively. As levels of renewable electricity 
generation increase, the Government will 
work closely with Ofgem and in consultation 
with the industry and other stakeholders to 
consider whether further steps might be 
necessary to address these. The Government 
will seek stakeholders’ views on our 
assessment of these electricity market 
issues in a call evidence on electricity this 
summer including the issue of how greater 
demand side management can be exploited.
The Government will consider responses 
as part of longer term planning under the 
roadmap work – see chapter 8.

Security of supply of fossil fuels

In addition to these actions, the UK needs 
to maintain security of supplies of fossil 
fuels, which will remain an essential input 
to our electricity supplies for many years 
to come. For example, average annual coal 
burn for generation is around 50 million 
tonnes. Around a third of this is supplied by 
the UK coal industry, which produced 17.4 
million tonnes in 2008. The Government is 
acting to maintain security of supplies both 
within the UK and internationally. Chapter 
4 sets out the Government’s view on the 
outlook for security of gas supplies, including 
Government action internationally to build 
good relationships with other countries to 
help ensure our supplies are secure.

78 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Over three quarters of the energy we use 
in our homes is for heating our rooms and 
water, most of which comes from gas-fired 
boilers. This accounts for 13% of the UK’s 
greenhouse gas emissions, but by 2050 
emissions from homes need to be  
almost zero.

The Transition Plan, along with wider policies, 
will cut emissions from homes by 29% on 
2008 levels. It will also improve the support 
to the most vulnerable, and secure the UK’s 
gas supplies as our indigenous reserves in 

the UK Continental Shelf decline. To do all 
this, the Plan will help us will reduce the 
amount of energy we use, and produce more 
of our heat and electricity in a low carbon 
way, using technologies such as solar power 
and heat pumps. 

Highlights of the Transition Plan include 
immediate help for households to make 
energy savings, helping to meet the 
commitment to insulate six million homes:

Increasing the obligation on energy 
suppliers to help households reduce 
emissions and save energy – the Carbon 
Emissions Reduction Target  – by 20% 
between April 2008 and March 2011, so 
that about £3.2 billion will be invested; 
and confirming that an obligation on 
energy suppliers will be maintained 
further into the future, up to the end 
of 2012, meaning around 1.5 million 
additional households will benefit from 
significant energy saving measures on 
top of the six million commitment

For delivering energy savings in the longer 
term, the Plan will:

Support households to take action by:

Installing smart meters in every home 
by the end of 2020, which will enable 
people to understand their energy use, 
maximise opportunities for energy 
saving, and offer better services from 
energy companies.

Encouraging the provision of smart 
displays now for existing meters 
benefitting some two to three million 
households, and launching a new 
personal carbon challenge with rewards 
and incentives for saving energy.

Summary




 Chapter 4: 79 
 Transforming our homes and communities

Developing more proactive services 
from the Energy Saving Trust to provide 
households with information and advice 
at the right times.

Help people meet the costs of 
transformation by:

Piloting a move from upfront payment to 
“pay as you save” models of long term 
financing for energy saving, so it will be 
more affordable to make the changes 
needed to make the whole house  
low carbon 

Introducing clean energy cash-back 
schemes so that people and businesses 
will be paid if they use low carbon 
sources to generate heat or electricity, 
meaning a household with a well-sited 
solar panels could receive over £800 plus 
bill savings of around £140 a year.

Coordinate the support available by:

Introducing a community-based 
approach to delivering treatments to 
homes in low-income areas, through the 
Community Energy Saving Programme.

Considering the delivery mechanisms 
that will best deliver significant whole 
house energy saving treatments in the 
longer term, setting out the strategy 
later this year.

Raise standards in every home by:

Consulting on requiring Energy 
Performance Certificate ratings for 
rented properties to be put on property 
advertisements; and consulting on 
extending access to EPC information  
to help target energy efficiency offers 
and support.

Requiring new-build homes to be built to 
high environmental standards, reaching 
‘zero carbon homes’ from 2016.

Help communities to act together by:

Announcing £10m for ‘Green villages, 
towns and cities’, a challenge for 
communities to be at the forefront of 
pioneering green initiatives, with 15 or  
so ‘test hub’ areas.

Developing an online ‘How to’ guide 
for anyone looking to install renewable 
and low-carbon energy generating 
technologies at community scale.

Exploring how to unlock greater action 
by local authorities in identifying the best 
potential for low carbon community-
scale solutions in their areas.

By 2020 the impact of these measures will 
be to add, on average, an additional 6% 
to today’s household bills. Including all our 
previously announced climate policies will 
increase this figure to 8%. This Transition 
Plan will help the most vulnerable with 
their energy bills by:

Creating mandated social price 
support at the earliest opportunity 
with increased resources compared 
to the current voluntary system. The 
Government is minded to focus new 
resources particularly on older pensioner 
households on the lowest incomes.

Increasing the level of Warm Front grants 
so most eligible applicants get their 
energy saving measures without having 
to contribute payment themselves.

Working to ensure that fuel poor 
households can benefit from new 
schemes, such as the Renewable Heat 
Incentive, to help reduce bills.

Securing the gas the UK needs during the 
transition to low carbon, by maximising 
economic production of UK reserves, 
improving our capacity to import and to 
store gas, and having in place the strategic 
partnerships to source gas imports. The 
Government will shortly be issuing a 
commentary on gas security of supply.




80 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The scale of the task
Households directly contribute to climate 
change through the energy we use to heat 
our homes and our water; and indirectly 
through other resource use including 
electricity used to power appliances (see 
chapter 3) and through the energy to treat 
and supply our water. Our use of gas to 
heat our homes also exposes us to energy 
security issues as indigenous gas supplies 
decline. The cost of meeting our heating 
needs can be difficult for some households 
to afford.

The energy that households use to heat their 
homes and water accounts for over 80% of 
total household energy use (see chart 2), and 
the emissions from this account for 13% of 
the UK’s total emissions (chart 3).

By 2050, the UK will need to have cut its 
greenhouse gas emissions by four-fifths 
overall. Looking across the options available, 
that means we will need to radically reduce 
demand for energy and decarbonise the 
energy we use in our homes almost totally 
by 2050. Our homes need to become much 
more energy efficient and we need to 
produce more of our heat and electricity from 
low carbon sources, such as ground and air-
source heat pumps and solar power.

1. The emission estimates in this chapter refer to greenhouse gas emissions from combustion of (gas, oil, and coal) in residential properties. These 
fuels meet most of our heating needs for our homes and hot water and a proportion our energy use for cooking. Around 7% of domestic heating 
needs are met with electricity, the emissions from which are covered in the power chapter

Note: Reductions due to policies introduced prior to the

Note: Product policy savings are negative because of the Heat 
Replacement Effect. More energy efficient products create 
less ambient heat which needs replacing via alternative fuel 
sources. Overall, products policy provides a significant net 
benefit, due to savings in emissions in the traded sector and 
their associated benefits.

82 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

All households will need to play a part in this 
transformation. But we recognise that there 
are a number of obstacles to overcome in 
making the transition:

Our current system works well, and 
because we are used to the way our 
boilers and appliances work, we have little 
appetite for change. Many of us are not 
aware of the options available, and we tend 
not to want to spend our time researching 
them to find out.

Many of the changes we need to make 
to our buildings can involve disruption and 
cost. For example solid wall insulation 
can mean the need to redecorate rooms 
and can sometimes mean losing floor 
space. The cost of improving the energy 
performance of buildings has to be 
balanced against other priorities, even if 
we get the money back over time through 
savings on our energy bills. People living 
in rented accommodation face a further 
obstacle, if they are not able to make 
changes to the property.

Modernising our buildings will not in  
itself be enough  – we will also need to 
change our habits. Energy and resource 
use is not very visible and most of us have 
little idea of how much energy we use for 
different things. It is not always easy for 
people to see how small individual actions 
can make a difference. Sometimes people 
can be more effective by working together 
as a community.

The Government wants to help people 
afford the energy they need to keep  
warm, but it can be difficult to reach  
those people experiencing fuel poverty 
who most need help.2

During the transition to low carbon, gas 
will continue to be a significant source 
of heating. The UK’s gas supplies are 
declining and we will need to make better 
use of it and good use of imports.

The plan to 2020
The policies set out in this Transition  
Plan will ensure that by 2020, the emissions 
from heating our homes will fall by 29% on 
2008 levels; and that the most vulnerable 
people are protected from fuel poverty, and 
gas supplies for heating homes and other 
uses, are secure. The measures in this Plan 
will contribute 13% of the emission savings 
in the third budget period (see chart 4). 
Because of the challenges in this task, the 
Government must help to enable households 
to transform home energy efficiency and 
promote low carbon energy. 

Earlier this year, the Government had a 
detailed public dialogue on the plans to 
transform home energy efficiency and 
provide low carbon energy. The majority of 
the people involved were overwhelmingly 
positive about improving their homes and 
using low carbon technologies, in principle. 
Participants said they look to the Government 
to take the lead, and are ready for some bold 
steps, but want information and advice, and 
help meeting financial costs.3

By 2020 we will cut emissions from homes to 29% 
below 2008 levels

2  The Fuel Poverty Strategy sets out a definition of a fuel poor household as being one that needs to spend more than 10% of its income on fuel to 
maintain a satisfactory heating regime (usually 21 degrees for the main living area, and 18 degrees for other occupied rooms).

4. Increasing the obligation on suppliers from lifetime carbon savings of 154 million tonnes carbon dioxide saved to 185 million tonnes.

A lot has already been done – for example 
almost two-thirds of cavity walls are now 
filled in the UK and 35% of lofts are insulated 
to at least 150mm. Warm Front fits or repairs 
a central heating system every minute of 
every working day in vulnerable households 
across England. But it is clear there is a  
long way to go to make progress to 2020.  
This Transition Plan sets out below action 
being taken:

Immediate help for households to make 

energy savings through subsidised energy 
saving and insulation measures

Delivering energy savings in the  

longer term

Information to encourage action with 
proactive advice services and installation 
of smart meters

Helping people meet the costs of 

transformation piloting new finance 
arrangements for home energy 
improvements and payment for low 
carbon energy 

Coordinating the support available 
to explore whether new approaches 
to delivery will be better tailored to the 
scale of challenge

Raising standards in every home 

Helping communities to act together 

through collective action and local 
authority involvement

Protecting consumers and helping the 

most vulnerable with their energy bills to 
tackle fuel poverty.

Securing our gas supplies in the 
transition to a low carbon future.

Putting the plan 
into practice

Immediate help for 
households to make 
energy savings
In September 2008, the Prime Minister 
announced the ambitious £1 billion Home 
Energy Saving Programme, to help families 
permanently cut their energy bills and to 
increase the rate of energy saving and  
carbon reduction, committing to insulate  
six million homes by the end of 2011. 
Reducing demand for energy will also  
reduce our need to import gas.

In February 2009, the Government set  
out its proposals to significantly increase  
the amount of help householders can  
receive to take up energy efficiency 
measures over the next few years, by 
requiring energy supply companies to  
offer more support to consumers:

The Government has increased by 20% 

the amount of support energy supply 

companies will make available through 

the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target 

(CERT). The scheme has already helped 
over six million households with significant 
energy saving measures since 2002. 
The suppliers will now have to meet an 
increased level of emissions reductions,4 
meaning that an extra £0.6 billion is 
likely to be spent, bringing total support 
between 2008 and 2011 to an estimated 
£3.2 billion. Of this, it is estimated that 
around £1.9 billion will be directed at 
vulnerable households.




84 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The Government is committed to helping six million 
households insulate their homes by the end of 2011

To give consumers more opportunity 
to benefit from this support, the 
Government now confirms following 

consultation that it will maintain an 

obligation on energy suppliers further 

into the immediate future, extending 

the end date of the CERT from April 

2011 to the end of 2012.5 The suppliers’ 
target for this period will be at least as 
ambitious as the current scheme on a 
pro rata basis, meaning around 1.5 million 
additional households could benefit on 
top of the six million commitment. The 
Government will propose that during this 
additional period there be a particular focus 
on insulation measures; and any early 
action which exceeds existing obligations 
under CERT will be proposed to be eligible 
towards an obligation for the extended 
period. The Government will also explore 
how best to provide help to those most 
vulnerable, including those living in fuel 
poverty. The Government aims to publish 
a consultation on the details of this by 
the end of 2009. This will provide industry 
partners with greater certainty so that they 
can make the necessary business planning 
and investment decisions to deliver these 
measures.

Delivering energy 
savings in the  
longer term
Over the longer term, as the potential for 
first steps like loft insulation and filling cavity 
walls has been taken up, we will need more 
substantial changes to existing homes and 
new homes, such as solid wall insulation and 
new low carbon sources of heat supply and 
electricity.The Government intends for all 
lofts and cavity walls to be insulated where 
practicable and where households want it  
by 2015.

In February 2009, the Government 

announced the “Great British Refurb”  

and launched its consultation on long-

term plans for heat and energy saving.6 

A summary of responses to the consultation 
has been published; and later in 2009 the 
Government will set out its strategy. The 
consultation set out the Government’s 
ambition that by 2030 all homes will have 
undergone a ‘whole house’ package including 
all cost-effective energy saving measures, 
plus renewable and low-carbon heat and 
electricity measures as appropriate. 

Supplying the materials and installing  
the insulation and other energy saving 
measures into millions of people’s homes 
will be a big task and an employment 
and economic opportunity for the green 
building sector and its supply chain over the 
medium term. Developing and deploying 
new technologies for low carbon energy 
and energy efficiency at household and 
community level will also present significant 
opportunities for UK industry.

Box 1 
The ‘whole house’ approach

A ‘whole house’ approach means considering a household’s energy needs and 
carbon dioxide impacts as a whole, and establishing a comprehensive package of 
measures to address them. 

The aim would be to include all the measures available that are suitable for a property 
and which could pay back through energy bill savings over their lifetime. This should 
result in a coordinated package, which will also include renewable energy measures 
where appropriate to the property.

A key benefit of the ‘whole house’ approach is that it ensures that the needs of 
the property are assessed as a whole, that they happen in the right order, and that 
disruption is minimised.

86 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

to reward people for doing the right 

thing, as well as helping people take 

action together, the Government will be 

launching a new national energy saving 

challenge this autumn, with prizes and 

incentives for saving carbon. The plans are 
being discussed with the energy companies, 
and further details will be available shortly.

The Government-funded Energy Saving Trust 
will develop more proactive services to make 
sure that the right advice reaches people at 
the right time and to help them get from the 
advice stage to implementation more easily. 
The Energy Saving Trust is already helping 
over three million customers a year through 
the Government’s Act On CO


2

 helpline, as 

well as a website and regional advice centres 
around the UK. This new service will involve:

Providing information to 
encourage action

To encourage action, the Government 
needs to make sure that people have 
the right information available to prompt 
interest in energy savings, and impartial and 
accurate advice at the right time to enable 
householders to undertake the changes to 
their home that will help cut carbon, energy 
bills and our need for gas.

Smart meters are key to revolutionising 
customer service and maximising energy-
saving. The Government has committed 
to mandating smart meters and has set 

out an indicative timetable for getting 

smart metering to all homes by the end 

of 2020. Smart meters let customers know 
exactly how much energy they are using and 
what they are spending on it, encouraging 
them to act on energy efficiency advice. 
They also mean no more bills based on 
estimates or staying at home for meter 
readings. Energy suppliers will be able to 
offer improved services, such as a wider 
range of tariffs and incentive packages, and 
the Government anticipates improved service 
levels and smoother switching between 
suppliers. Smart metering will support the 
use of microgeneration that in coming years, 
will help secure energy supply and provide 
a platform for future smart grids, which are 
described in chapter 3.

As an immediate step in this direction, the 
Government has decided to include smart 
displays, which can be used with existing 
meters, amongst the range of measures that 
energy companies can offer their customers 
under the Carbon Emission Reduction Target. 
As a result, the Government expects two to 
three million households to get a new tool 
to help them take control of their emissions, 
and see exactly how much energy they are 
using in real time. To build on this and 

Smart meters and displays will help people to 
understand the energy they are using, and save 
money on bills




 Chapter 4: 87
 Transforming our homes and communities

Contacting all householders with properties 
that have received the lowest home energy 
ratings (F and G ratings) in their Energy 
Performance Certificates, to offer tailored 
advice on energy savings steps that could 
be taken.

Providing a new Home Action Plan product, 
where a household pays a subsidised cost 
for a thorough home energy audit, and a 
personal carbon reduction plan showing 
the energy saving steps to take, and their 
costs and savings potential.

Offering more support for people wanting 
to know how to generate their own low 
carbon energy.

Developing a Grant Information Database 
to help people to find out about the funding 
offers available where they live.

Finding ways to make it easier for people 
to find builders and tradespeople with the 
right energy efficiency competencies

Helping people meet the costs 
of transformation

In the longer term, additional steps will  
be needed to overcome greater challenges 
such as bigger costs and disruption for 
householders, and there will be a need 
for greater levels of coordination across 
communities. New finance offers and 
different forms of financial support may  
be required to achieve this. 

To test how to best help people to afford 
to make these changes, the Government 
is now announcing that it will pilot a move 
from upfront payment to ‘pay as you save’ 
models of financing, to help people to be 
able to meet the costs of transforming their 
homes to the best efficiency standards. This 
will spread the upfront costs into the future 

– the costs of improvements would be offset 
by energy bill savings. The Government will 
work with the Energy Saving Trust, energy 
companies, Local Authorities, the Distribution 
Network Operators (DNOs) and others to 
test uptake of this innovative financing, as 
well as householder interest in the ‘whole 
house’ approach. The Government will 
spend £4 million on these pilots and there is 
potential for match funding from a number 
of partners. Ofgem is considering scope for 
pilot funding for DNOs, under proposals for 
a new innovation incentive in the electricity 
distribution price control, to take effect from 
April 2010.

The Government wants to help people 
generate their own heat and electricity in  
low carbon ways, where appropriate. While 
these technologies typically save carbon  
and money, they can be more expensive 
to install, and so some financial support is 
necessary. To stimulate the UK’s transition  
to local low carbon energy generation,  
the Government will be providing more 

financial assistance to enable a much 

bigger roll-out, with ‘clean energy cash 

back’ schemes, including plans for the 

only stand-alone support scheme of its 

kind for renewable heat in the world. 
The schemes include:

A new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) 

that will significantly ramp up the level 

of support available from April 2011.8 
This will provide households, communities 
and businesses with payment for getting 
their heat from renewable sources. The 
scheme will cover industrial through to 
domestic scale heat production. The 
Government will consult on the detailed 
design of the Renewable Heat Incentive 
later this year.

7. The Government plans to consult on extending access to Energy Performance Certificate information so that Government Departments, local 
authorities, and relevant agencies are better able to target offers and support. 

8. Renewable heat technologies include: air- and ground-source heat pumps, biomass fuelled stoves and boilers, solar-thermal water heaters and 
combined heat and power plants fuelled from renewable sources.

will be working closely with local authorities 
and community groups to help deliver 
renewable heat to fuel poor households. 
The Renewable Energy Strategy, published 
alongside this Transition Plan, gives more 
details of the two schemes, including the 
timeframes for operation.11

The Government is putting in place 

financial rewards for small-scale 

low carbon electricity generation, 

with Feed-in Tariffs from April 2010. 
Payment for the electricity produced by 
small-scale generators, will be provided 
through the electricity supply companies 
and encourage the uptake of renewables 
by schools, homeowners, hospitals, 
businesses and communities.9 The 
Government is consulting on the detailed 
design and proposed tariff levels for Feed-
in Tariffs alongside this Transition Plan.10 A 
household with a well-sited photovoltaic 
installation could receive over £800 plus 
bill savings of around £140 a year.

It is crucial that the RHI is available to 
everyone. The Government wants to make 
sure those on low incomes or who are fuel 
poor are able to benefit from this scheme and The UK’s Renewable Heat Incentive will be the only 

scheme of its kind in the world, providing stand-
alone support for renewable heat. Illustration of

 Chapter 4: 89
 Transforming our homes and communities

The increased burning of biomass in small 
scale boilers in areas with existing air quality 
problems may present an issue. Although 
the most modern domestic biomass boilers 
produce very low levels of air pollutants, 
their use in these areas needs to be carefully 
managed. The Government is considering 
whether, in the case of biomass boilers 
under 20MW, to limit the RHI to those 
boilers that meet certain emission standards, 
and will consult on this later this year. The 
Government has provided guidance to local 
authorities about what type of biomass 
boilers can be safely located where. The 
Government is also taking steps to ensure 
an increased supply of biomass can be met 
sustainably. 

Co-ordinating the  
support available

Helping people to make the significant 
changes to their home required in the 
medium to long term will require strong 
co-ordination of the advice and funding 
support available – bringing together different 
aspects, such as energy saving measures 
and low-carbon energy generation. To enable 
installation of packages of measures across 
whole streets or communities rather than 
targeting individual houses, close links 
to local strategic decision making will be 
needed. As a result, a different approach to 
delivery may be required. 

The Government is introducing a new 

community-based approach to delivering 

treatments to homes in low-income 

areas, the Community Energy Saving 

Programme, from Autumn 2009. This £350 
million, three-year, programme will be funded 
by a new obligation on energy suppliers and 
electricity generators. This will see the energy 
companies working in partnership with local 
authorities and community organisations 

to deliver energy efficiency measures to 
around 90,000 homes across approximately 
100 low-income areas across Great Britain.12 
This targeted programme of improvements 
will contribute to our carbon reduction 
objectives, support our fuel poverty strategy 
as discussed below, and inform future 
mechanisms for delivering energy saving 
measures. 

The Government consulted in February 2009 
on whether the current obligation on energy 
suppliers was fit for delivering energy savings 
in a more co-ordinated and ‘whole house’ 
way in the longer term.13 A summary of 
responses has been published. It is generally 
felt that the supplier-led approach has been 
successful, but there was less consensus 
on the delivery approach best placed to 
deliver the scale of change now required. 
Some respondents were interested in the 
idea of greater central coordination, and 
some believed that Local Authorities were 
well placed to deliver. Other respondents 
were of the view that energy suppliers 
should continue to lead, and others favoured 
a combination of different players. The 
Government is assessing the responses 

and intends to publish the strategy later 

in 2009.

Raising standards in every home

As well as making it easier for people to 
transform their homes, the Government 
recognises that to enable everyone to make 
a contribution and to ensure the scale of 
change needed is achieved, we must raise 
standards in every type of housing.

Social sector housing is already more 
energy efficient than housing generally. The 
Government has made major investment in 
improving social housing – more than £22 
billion since 2001, including through the 
Decent Homes programme. This has raised

the condition of social housing, including 
warmth and comfort. By 2010, about 95% of 
social housing stock in England is expected 
to meet the Decent Homes standard, and 
following the last Budget, an additional 
£84 million will be invested in cavity wall 
insulation in English social housing. The 
Government will show leadership by ensuring 
that social housing meets, and where 
possible exceeds, the aims it is setting for all 
housing on energy efficiency and low carbon 
energy. The Government is considering, 
with the Tenant Services Authority, the 
need to identify aspirational standards 
and benchmarks for energy savings and 
emissions reductions in refurbishment, for 
different property types.

Private rented accommodation is one of the 
most difficult sectors to improve because 
whilst it is the tenants that benefit from 
energy saving improvements as they pay the 
bills, it is landlords who own the property and 
decide what changes to make. To improve 
professionalism and quality in the sector,  
the Government is consulting on whether 

to establish a register of private landlords, 

and whether to make the energy 

performance ratings of rented properties 

available to local authorities.14 These 
steps would build on the powers given to 
local authorities in 2004 to take enforcement 
action to improve the condition of rented 
housing – including energy efficiency 
standards – and would help to inform and 
target this work.15

In addition, the Government will:

Consult on requiring people to put Energy 
Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings for 
all rented properties alongside particulars 
of property advertisements, so that 
potential tenants know more about energy 
performance from an early stage.

Consult on extending access to EPC 
information for all homes so government 
departments, local authorities and relevant 
agencies are able to target offers and 
support.

Subject to final decisions to establish the 
landlords register proposed in the Rugg 
review, consult on giving the Energy Saving 
Trust access to that register so that they 
are able to target offers and support to 
landlords more effectively, particularly 
identifying those with large numbers of 
properties. 

Consider how to improve enforcement 
guidance to local authorities for the 
Housing Health and Safety Rating System, 
in the light of experience of operating  
the regime.

By 2010, around 95% 
of our social housing 
will meet the Decent 
Homes standard, 
meaning acceptable 
levels of comfort and 
warmth for tenants




 Chapter 4: 91
 Transforming our homes and communities

The consultation on the long term Heat 
and Energy Saving Strategy set out a broad 
package of measures to help all homes 
make improvements. These will need time 
to bed down and become established before 
their impact can be properly assessed. If 
these measures alone do not achieve the 

reductions in energy use required by 2012, 

the Government may need to consider 

stronger regulatory measures as part 

of its strategy. Ongoing evaluation will 

inform whether this is necessary.

Looking to the future, we also need to make 
sure that our new homes and communities 
are built to high environmental standards. 
New homes will be built to a zero carbon 

standard from 2016, meaning that their 

net carbon emissions over a year will 

be zero. This will require high standards of 
energy efficiency, and any remaining carbon 
that is not abated onsite to be dealt with 
in ways to be specified. The Government 
has consulted on the detail of the definition 
of ‘zero carbon’, and will announce further 
thinking shortly. Progress towards the ‘zero 
carbon’ standard will be made through 
the progressive tightening of the Building 
Regulations and the Government recently 
set out proposals for the first step of 25% 
improvement in 2010.16

In 2007, the Code for Sustainable Homes 
became operational and homes are being 
completed at each of the levels.17 The Code 
supports the zero carbon target and the 
changes in regulation along the way, allowing 
developers to be recognised for building to 
higher standards sooner.

Building zero carbon homes will require 
substantial change on the part of house 
builders and their suppliers. By setting the 
regulatory aims a long time in advance, 

and with defined steps, the Government 
aims to give certainty for investors and 
allow business to find the best way to 
meet the challenges. The Government 
is supporting the Zero Carbon Hub; to 
help home builders prepare through the 
Technology Strategy Board’s Low Impact 
Buildings Innovation Platform it will assist 
business to harness the growing market for 
environmentally sustainable new buildings; 
and the Homes and Communities Agency 
is funding exemplar projects.18 Budget 
2009 announced £100 million funding for 

local authorities to deliver new energy 

efficient homes, and Building Britain’s 

Future19 announced up to £250 million for 

direct development by local authorities of 

around 3,000 new energy efficient homes.

Through the planning regime, and in 
particular the Planning Policy Statement: 
Planning and Climate Change,20 the 

New homes will be built to a zero carbon standard 
from 2016

16. Part L of the Building Regulations specify the minimum energy efficiency requirements for new buildings and certain categories of work to 
existing buildings in England and Wales. The current version came into effect in 2006, and improvements are proposed for 2010, 2013, and 2016.

Helping communities to  
act together

Helping communities to take action is an 
integral part of the Government’s strategy. 
We often achieve more acting together than 
as individuals. The role of the Government 
should be to create an environment where 
the innovation and ideas of communities can 
flourish, and people feel supported in making 
informed choices, so that living greener lives 
becomes easy and the norm. 

In this vein, the Government has supported 
a number of initiatives. These include the 
Greener Living Fund, a £6.1 million fund for 
Third Sector delivery partners to help people 
live more sustainably; the Climate Challenge 
Fund, a £8.5 million fund to help communities 

Government requires new developments to 
be located and designed to reduce carbon 
emissions. The Government is also piloting 
new developments which meet the highest 
environmental standards on a large scale, 
for example with the eco-towns, the Thames 
Gateway eco-region and the London Olympic 
Park. These approaches will provide learning 
and help to point the way in decarbonising 
existing communities. The Government will 
shortly publish its Planning Policy Statement: 
eco-towns, which sets out the high standards 
that eco-towns must achieve in tackling 
climate change and delivering affordable 
housing.21 Eco-towns offer opportunities to 
create thriving new communities, to test and 
bring to market new technologies, to support 
green skills and industries, and to help people 
to live more sustainably.

Box 2 
The Olympic Park will be a blueprint for sustainable living

It is the Government’s ambition that the 
London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
Games will be sustainable, with the 
Olympic Park a blueprint for sustainable 
living. It presents many opportunities 
to try new technologies, low carbon 
materials and innovative solutions. 

Energy efficiency and water efficiency 
have been central to the design of the 
Olympic Park in East London. The aim 
is to reduce carbon emissions from the 
built environment in the Olympic Park 
by 50% by 2013. This will be achieved 
through:

 Making the Athletes’ Village 44% more 
energy efficient than 2006 standards; 
and reducing water consumption 
by 20% compared to the London 
average.

 Using an innovative combined 
cooling, heat and power plant to 
supply the Park and Athletes’ Village 
with energy, which will result in 20-
25% reduction in carbon emissions in 
the longer term.

 Using on-site renewable energy 
sources during and after the games 
to reduce the call on conventional 
energy sources by 20%.

 Transporting 50% of construction 
materials by rail or river, and a target 
to reclaim 90% of demolition waste 
materials for reuse or recycling - this 
target continues to be exceeded.

In addition, the Park is being landscaped 
and planned to cope with climate 
change and flood risk.

Endowment for Science, Technology and 
the Arts, a £1 million prize to galvanise 
community-led innovation in response to 
climate change. The Big Green Challenge is 
the first prize of its scale for the not-for-profit 
sector. Given the number and quality of the 
proposals, the Government has now provided 
£600,000 to expand the Challenge and fund 
a new round of projects drawn from the top 
100 unfunded proposals.

The Government wants to take community 
transition to the next level, announcing £10 
million for ‘Green villages, towns and cities’– 
a challenge for communities to be at the 
forefront of pioneering green initiatives.22 
Around fifteen communities will be selected 
to participate as ‘test hubs’, with local 
residents, businesses, and the public sector 
playing a leading role, and eco-towns will be 
invited to participate. Participants will work 
together to develop community-wide plans 

Box 3 Case study:  
Ashton Hayes used a grant from 
the Climate Challenge Fund to cut 
carbon emissions from the village

Ashton Hayes, in Cheshire, was the 
first village in the UK to announce its 
intention to become a ‘zero carbon 
community’. Since January 2006, the 
community has cut its carbon dioxide 
emissions by 20%. The project has 
partnered with Chester University to 
establish the baseline and measure 
carbon savings. The village is currently 
working with partners to look into the 
feasibility of a ‘microgrid’ to generate 
and supply electricity to buildings in 
the village on an opt-in basis.

Ashton Hayes received support of 
£26,500 from the Government’s 
Climate Challenge Fund, which was 
used to promote the initiative and 
share lessons with others. A film was 
produced and a conference was run for 
other community carbon projects. See 
www.goingcarbonneutral.co.uk

different initiatives – for example in energy 
and water conservation, or travel – work

to explore new approaches to delivering 
to vulnerable groups by overcoming the 
particular barriers they face; and to share 
learning between the ‘hubs’ as part of a 
wider citizen-led pilot. If successful, the 
Government can use what we learn to help 
roll-out of a nationwide plan, potentially 
helping every city, town and village make the 
transition to a sustainable future. 

Working with local and  

regional government

The local government performance 
framework gives an opportunity for local 
government and partners to reflect their 
priorities through the Local Area Agreements. 
Within this framework, around 97% of areas 
have already chosen to set targets against at 
least one of three climate change indicators. 
In addition, over 340 local authorities have 
signed the Nottingham Declaration on 
climate change.23 Local government and 
its partners are clearly choosing to respond 
positively to the opportunity to agree 
targets on addressing climate change. £3 
million has been provided under the Best 

Practice Programme, which has helped 

local authorities take action by building 

capacity and spreading good practice.24

The Government wants to encourage  
and empower local authorities to take 
additional action in tackling climate change, 
where they wish to do so. It believes that 
people should increasingly be able to look 
to their local authority not only to provide 
established services, but also to co-ordinate, 

tailor and drive the development of a low 
carbon economy in their area, in a way that 
suits their preferences. The Government will 
shortly consult stakeholders on the role that 
local authorities can play in meeting national 
carbon budgets, how this could work at a 
local level, and how this might combine  
an increased ambition on reducing carbon 
with possible new powers and flexibilities  
in this area.

The nine English regions are already taking 
action to help meet the UK’s greenhouse gas 
targets and budgets. The Local Democracy 
Economic Development and Construction Bill 
will require each English region to develop 
a new single Regional Strategy, which must 
include plans to tackle climate change. It is 
essential that regional policy and action is 
consistent with the Government’s emission 
reductions targets. Government Offices 
in the region will play an important role 
in supporting the delivery of this national 
strategy by working with partners at  
regional and local level. 

Community-scale low carbon energy 

generation

As well as ensuring that governance 
frameworks are aligned, the Government 
wants to encourage local authorities and 
others in bringing forward more community-
scale heat and electricity generation. For 
example, community heating provides 2% of 
heating needs in the UK, but it could play a 
bigger role of up to 14%.25

To help achieve an increase in community 
energy generation, the Government has 
tasked local authorities to incorporate 

energy planning into their decision 

making processes, through the Climate

96 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Protecting consumers
The alternative to meeting our carbon 
budgets is not a low cost, high carbon future, 
but a high cost high carbon future. We are 
becoming increasingly dependent on other 
countries for our oil and gas supplies. As set 
out in chapter 1, if the UK pursues a high 
carbon future, we will be exposed to global 
factors which could cause rises and spikes 
in energy prices. Last year, when oil prices 
reached nearly $150/barrel, the cost of filling 
up a car tank rose £10 and electricity and gas 
bills rose £300 on average. 

Although taking action on climate change 
is worth it, there will still be a cost. The 
Government has designed its policies to 
minimise these costs. 

The measures set out in the Transition Plan 
will put upward pressure on energy prices 
and bills. The Government estimates that the 
additional impact in 2020 of policies in this 
Transition Plan, relative to today, is £76 per 
year, which is equivalent to approximately a 
6% increase from current energy bills. When 
previously announced climate policies are 
included this figure is 8%.1 

The increase in energy bills is caused by the 
use of renewable generating technologies 

A new ‘How to’ guide will help anyone  
looking install renewable and low-carbon heat  
and electricity generating technologies at 
community scale

Examine the case for local authorities to 
have greater ability to require existing 
developments to connect to heating 
schemes, to complement their ability to 
require new developments to connect.

Investigate opportunities to strengthen 
the consideration given to CHP when 
companies are selecting the location and 
design of power stations. The Government 
will review its guidance to developers 
on this with a view to ensuring both that 
developers give serious consideration 
to opportunities for Combined Heat and 
Power and identification of potential heat 
customers while at the same time making 
it easier for them to do so.

To make it easier for local authorities, 
businesses or community groups to 
generate electricity at community scale 
the Government has worked with Ofgem 
to introduce new licensing arrangements 
that make it easier for community energy 
schemes to interact with the wider electricity 
system. Further work is planned to ensure 
arrangements work effectively in practice.

To offer further help, the Government is 
now providing new funding to develop 

an online ‘How to’ guide for community 

energy, to be widely available from early 

2010. This will be an information hub for 
anyone looking to install renewable and 
low-carbon heat and electricity generating 
technologies at community scale. For 
example, it will highlight the benefits of 
cooperative ownership, and signpost 
community groups to existing information; 
and the Government will clarify the scope 
for local authorities to establish rolling 
investment funds, including through 
their own borrowing, designed to permit 
individuals and groups in their areas to  
fund schemes.

27. £76 as a proportion of average household energy bills today (approximately 1,184) is 6%. The 8% increase includes major recent climate policies, 
older/smaller policies are necessarily included in the baseline. Calculations assume $80/barrel oil price in 2020. Bill impacts are dealt with in detail 
in the Analytical Annex to the Transition Plan.




 Chapter 4: 97
 Transforming our homes and communities

that are more expensive than electricity 
from fossil fuels at today’s prices. However, 
much of this increase is offset by the energy 
efficiency policies in the Transition Plan, 
including CERT, CESP, Warm Front, and smart 
meters policies. 

Those who insulate their homes or take 
advantage of help to switch to renewable 
forms of heating will be partly shielded from 
these impacts. If oil prices reached their 
previous peak of around $150/barrel then  
the benefits of going green would be  
even greater. 28

Keeping the price of energy 

competitive 

We need our energy system to deliver results 
that are fair to consumers. For many years 
residential consumers have benefited from 
the UK’s competitive energy market – in the 
period from 1997-2007, UK domestic gas 
prices have been among the lowest in the 
EU15.29 Over the same period, UK domestic 
electricity prices have never been above the 
EU15 median. Consumers should also have 
the right information to enable them to make 
the right decisions about buying, using and 
saving energy.

Ofgem, the independent regulator, plays 
a key role in ensuring fair outcomes 
and treatment for consumers. In 2008, 
following concern from the Government 
and public about prices and other issues, 
Ofgem launched a detailed probe into 
retail energy markets. In its initial findings 
Ofgem reported that it had found no 
evidence of anti-competitive practices, 
but it did find evidence of unjustified 
pricing differences and other problems.

In response to Government and Ofgem 
concern at these findings, energy suppliers 
moved to address this unfair treatment and 

Ofgem is now concluding changes to outlaw 
such behaviour in future.

Ofgem’s probe also found that energy 
bills and tariffs can be hard to understand. 
Following their recent consultation, Ofgem 
will very shortly be introducing licence 
modifications to enhance customer 
information via the bill and an annual 
statement. This will make it clearer to 
customers how much they are paying for 
their current tariff and make it easier for 
them to see if their supplier (or any other) 
offers anything cheaper for them. Ofgem 
has also decided to require suppliers to 
use a common price metric to further aid 
comparison of different suppliers’ tariffs. This 
is a real priority which should greatly help 
consumers in making the right choices and 
controlling their energy bills. The Government 
has strongly supported Ofgem’s work on 
the probe and where appropriate will act if 
the companies involved cannot agree. The 
Government also proposes to strengthen 

consumer protection, by:

penalties for breaches of licence conditions 
which occurred earlier than in the previous 
twelve months (the current limit). 

cases of undue exploitation of market 
power in the generation market.

certain types of cross-subsidy between 
gas and electricity supply businesses 
when these impact unfairly on groups of 
consumers, particularly electricity-only 
customers.

It is the Government’s intention to legislate 
on these additional powers and enforcement 
matters as well as the clarification to Ofgem’s 
principal objective at the earliest opportunity.

28. In addition, the Government’s policies on minimum performance standards for appliances, will cut more than £30 per household or £900 million off 
householder bills per year.

98 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Protecting the most vulnerable

Tackling fuel poverty is a priority for the 
Government. The Government is under a 
statutory duty to end fuel poverty, as far 
as reasonably practicable, in vulnerable 
households by 2010 and in all other 
households by 2016 in England. Up until 
2004, the number of households classed as 
“fuel poor” under the current definition of 
fuel poverty fell to a level of around 1.2 million 
households in England.31 However, despite 
significant Government action and funding, 
the numbers of people living in fuel poverty 
have shifted adversely. The projected figures 
for 2008 suggest that the total number of 
households living in fuel poverty in England 
will have risen to just over 3.5 million 
households (see chart 6).

The number of people in fuel poverty 
depends on three factors: household energy 

The Energy Act 2008 made it clearer that the principal objective of Ofgem in 
exercising its functions under the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 is to 
protect the interests of future as well as existing consumers. 

The Government now proposes to amend the legislation to clarify that this  
objective includes security of supply and reducing carbon emissions. These proposed  
changes will be complemented by new Social and Environmental Guidance to be 
published shortly.30

The Government continues to believe that effective competition remains the central 
way by which consumers’ interests can be protected. However, there are contexts in 
which the promotion of competition may not be sufficient and direct action by the 
regulator is necessary to protect consumers effectively. The Government proposes to 
amend the legislation to make this clearer, building on the existing legislation. These 
changes will not undermine the central role that competition plays in the operation of 
the energy sector and the Government will engage with the sector before making them.

Box 5
Clarifying Ofgem’s remit

30. Under the Electricity Act 1989 and the Gas Act 1986, the Secretary of State must issue guidance from time to time about Ofgem’s contribution 
towards the attainment of social or environmental policies to which Ofgem is required to have regard in the carrying out of its functions under the Act.

31. A household is said to be in fuel poverty if it needs to spend more than 10% of its income on fuel to maintain an adequate standard of warmth 
(usually defined as 21 oC for the main living area, and 18 oC for other occupied rooms). This broad definition of fuel costs also includes modeled 
spending on water heating, lights, appliances and cooking.

 Chapter 4: 99
 Transforming our homes and communities

efficiency, household incomes and energy 
prices. One of the key drivers of the recent 
increase in fuel poverty has been rising 
energy bills due to higher fossil fuel prices: 
energy prices increased, on average, by 16% 
every year between 2004 and 2008. These 
significant price increases are making the fuel 
poverty targets ever more challenging.

Another key challenge in making further 
progress is being able to identify and target 
support effectively at fuel poor households, 
which requires information on the 
household’s income, the price the household 
is paying for fuel, and the level of household 
energy efficiency. This picture is not static. 
For example: a household living in an energy 
inefficient home might not be in fuel poverty, 
but a lower income household moving into 
that same home might be; a household a 
little way out of fuel poverty might be brought 
into fuel poverty in the event of energy price 

increases; or a pensioner couple might not be 
in fuel poverty, but if one of them dies (and 
the household income consequently reduces) 
the other might be in fuel poverty.

For this reason, action to tackle fuel poverty 
is aimed not only at those people living 
in fuel poor households, but also to take 
preventative steps to stop households falling, 
or returning, into fuel poverty. 

Since 2000, the Government has spent 

£20 billion on benefits and programmes 

to tackle fuel poverty. The Government’s 
policies have been centred on:

reducing the demand for energy through 
improving home energy efficiency;

raising real incomes;

ensuring competitive energy prices 
through regulating the market, and through 
voluntary social pricing support schemes.

100 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The Government is increasing the grant 
limits for eligible households to £3,500 
(or £6,000 where oil or a new low carbon 
technology is recommended). This will mean 
that the vast majority of households will 
not have to contribute payment towards 
their measures.33 The scheme is also being 
expanded to pilot the installation of low 
carbon technologies.

32. Warm Front Annual Report (2008-09)
33. In 2008 prices between 1996 and 2006

These measures have had a real impact. 
The Government estimates that without the 
package of measures aimed at tackling fuel 
poverty the number of fuel poor households 
would have been around 400,000-800,000 
higher in England in 2008. The Government 
continues to look for ways in which it can 
make further progress. Earlier this year, the 
Government announced a review of its fuel 
poverty policies, examining whether existing 
measures to tackle fuel poverty could be 
made more effective, and considering 
whether new policies should be introduced.

This Transition Plan sets out existing policies, 
further progress made since the review 
was announced, and a new proposal on 
social pricing support. By 2020, the poorest 
households that are helped to install 
renewable heat technologies or insulation 
measures will have annual average energy 
bills £180 lower than if they had not received 
those measures. 

Improve energy efficiency of 

vulnerable households

Some households need more energy to 
keep warm, as a consequence of the type of 
dwellings they live in, the heating systems 
used and of the characteristics of their lives 
(for example, how much time is spent at 
home). So improving household energy 
efficiency and the performance of heating 
systems are important ways of reducing 
energy bills for households in fuel poverty.

Warm Front is the Government’s flagship 

energy efficiency and heating scheme for 

vulnerable households, with £950 million 

funding between 2008-2011. It has assisted 
nearly two million households since 2000–
over half a million households in the last two 
years alone. On average, each recipient has 
the potential to save over £350 per year on 
energy bills.32

Warm Front has helped almost 
two million households reduce 
their energy bills.

Mrs. Frost, 83, from Nottingham is in 
receipt of pension credit. She applied 
online to have her boiler replaced and 
two months later it was installed. Mrs 
Frost said: “I am delighted with the 
boiler replacement, everything was 
explained perfectly and everyone in 
the Warm Front Team were helpful”.

In December 2008, Mrs. Whitbread, 77, 
from Preston had a new radiator and 
thermostat installed. Mrs Whitbread 
said, “I was very pleased with the 
service I received from the Warm Front 
Team; the installers were courteous, 
efficient and helpful.”




 Chapter 4: 101
 Transforming our homes and communities

The new Community Energy Saving 

Programme (CESP), to be launched this 

autumn, is designed to be focused on 

areas of low income, where households 

are likely to have a greater propensity for 

entering fuel poverty than average. 
This new £350 million programme will 
improve energy efficiency and lower 
household fuel bills, and the partnership 
approach with local authorities and other 
community representative organisations, 
should help to reach some of the most 
vulnerable households. 

Under the Carbon Emissions Reduction 

Target (CERT), energy suppliers have to 

achieve 40% of the emissions reduction 

in a priority group of low-income 

households and the elderly, who are more 

likely to be in danger of falling into fuel 

poverty. The obligation on suppliers is due to 
increase by 20% from August 2009, meaning 
an estimated £1.9 billion will be directed at 
energy savings amongst the priority group in 
the period to 2011. For the extension period 
of CERT post-March 2011, the Government is 
exploring how best to provide help to some 
of the most vulnerable households.

The Decent Homes programme in social 

housing aims to ensure homes are warm 

and weatherproof and have reasonably 

modern facilities. By 2010 work will have 
been completed to 3.6 million council homes, 
with improvements for eight million people 
in total, including 2.5 million children. The 
Decent Homes programme has on average 
reduced tenant’s fuel bills by an estimated 
£152 a year.34

Raise incomes of the fuel poor

Raising incomes also helps to tackle fuel 
poverty. This can include employment 
measures, aimed at ensuring people are 
better equipped to work, such as Working 
Families Tax Credits; child benefit and child 

tax credit; increasing support for families on 
Income Support; the disability premium; and  
Pension Credit. 

This winter, the Winter Fuel Payments 
and additional support will provide £250 
for households with someone aged 60-79 
and £400 for households with someone aged 
80 and over (up from £20 when the Winter 
Fuel Payment was introduced in 1997). 
The Government also offers Cold Weather 
Payments for the most vulnerable people 
during very cold weather. Cold Weather 
Payments in Britain in 2008-09 amounted to 
around £210 million. 

As mentioned above, some people entitled 
to benefits are not claiming them. Every 
applicant to the Warm Front scheme is 
offered a Benefit Entitlement Check, and 
since April 2008, 78,000 checks have been 
completed. Additional eligible benefit has 
been identified in 45% of cases, resulting 
in an average weekly increase in household 
income of £31. 

There is also an important role for advice 
in protecting vulnerable households and 
the Government, in conjunction with other 
bodies, provides people over 60 with advice 
about how to stay healthy in the winter 
months. 

Reducing energy prices for the  

most vulnerable

The measures taken by Ofgem to protect 
consumers also benefits people living in, or 
at risk of, fuel poverty, by keeping the price of 
energy competitive. To further help vulnerable 
customers unable to afford their bills, the 
Government has negotiated a voluntary 
agreement with energy suppliers to increase 
their expenditure on social programmes. 
Under this agreement, the suppliers delivered 
£100m of spend on social programmes to 
vulnerable households in 2008-9, rising to 

34. The figures apply to applications made on or after 23 April 2009 and those applications made before that date but where the work has  
not commenced




102 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

£125 million in 2009-10 and £150 million 
in 2010-11. Examples of assistance from 
companies include rebates on annual bills 
and social tariffs. Ofgem estimated in 
December 2008 that 800,000 customer 
accounts were benefiting from some form of 
social or discounted tariff - almost double the 
number in March 2008.

The social price support available under the 
current voluntary agreement with energy 
suppliers has already made a real difference 
to the lives of a large number of vulnerable 
households. But the agreement comes 
to an end in March 2011. The Government 
has decided to build on the success of the 
voluntary agreement and will therefore 
bring forward new legislation at the earliest 
opportunity with the aim of placing social 
price support on a statutory footing when 
the current voluntary agreement ends in 
March 2011. As part of this new statutory 
framework, the Government will ensure 
there is an increase in the resources available 
and give the suppliers greater guidance and 
direction on the types of households eligible 
for future support. 

The Government will continue to develop this 
policy over the coming months, engaging 
with interested parties and would expect to 
consult on the detailed arrangements of the 
scheme in 2010. Subject to further policy 
development, the Government is minded to 
focus a large part of the additional resources 
on those older pensioner households on the 
lowest incomes who are at greatest risk of 
excess winter death and who tend to have a 
high incidence of fuel poverty. The intention 
would be to offer support in the form of 
a fixed sum off the household electricity 
bill. This offers a clear benefit to recipients 
including those off the gas grid, minimises 
any distortion to competitive energy markets 
and maintains the incentive to make prudent 
use of energy. The Government will continue 
to work with the energy suppliers to explore 

more effective ways of targeting the price 
support at the most vulnerable households.

Ofgem has a role in administering and 
monitoring the current voluntary agreement. 
The Government is working with Ofgem to 
define Ofgem’s continued role in this area.

As described earlier, the Government  
is also working to ensure that fuel poor 
households can benefit from new schemes 
such as the Renewable Heat Incentive, 
and the ‘Green villages, towns and cities’ 
communities scheme. 

Formalising the current voluntary agreement will 
allow energy suppliers to extend price support to 
more of the most vulnerable households




 Chapter 4: 103
 Transforming our homes and communities

Keeping gas supplies 
secure in the transition
The UK is heavily dependent on gas to 
heat our homes and provide domestic hot 
water. Around a third of UK primary gas 
consumption is used for this purpose.35 Gas 
is also used by industry and for electricity 
generation (as set out in chapter 3).

In the long-term the UK must reduce its 
dependence on fossil fuels. As set out 
above, the Government plans to do this 
through reducing our need for gas through 
improving the energy efficiency of new and 
existing homes and by using alternative, 
low carbon sources of heat where available. 
In the medium-term the UK can begin to 
decarbonise its gas supplies by injecting 
renewable gas into the grid. The Renewable 
Energy Strategy sets out in more detail how 
renewable gas can be produced.

The Government expects that the measures 
outlined in this Transition Plan will reduce net 
UK gas demand by 29% in 2020, when it 
is expected the UK will be using around 66 
billion cubic metres a year, compared to a 
demand without the Transition Plan of around 
93 billion cubic metres a year. As a switch 
away from gas is made, there may be some 
scope for using parts of the gas transmission 
and distribution networks for other purposes, 
such as carbon capture storage.

But during the transition to a low carbon 
future, oil and gas will remain key sources of 
energy both in the UK and internationally. In 
the UK oil and gas currently supply 75% of 
our primary energy needs. The UK must be 
able to access reliable supplies to support 
the transition by avoiding interruptions and 
reducing the risk of avoidable price rises.  
The Government’s approach includes:

maximising the economic production  
of UK oil and gas – a large proportion  
of our gas is produced from oil fields;

improving our capacity to import and  
to store gas;

having in place the strategic partnerships 
to source gas imports.

Maximising the economic 
production of North Sea  
oil and gas

Realising the full potential of the UK’s 
indigenous oil and gas resources, both 
offshore and onshore, is central to our 
security of supply, as well as having 
substantial benefits for the UK economy and 
employment – (taking account of supply-
chain exports to the global market and other 
indirect employment, oil and gas activities 
support more than 400,000 jobs in the 
UK). But after four decades of oil and gas 
extraction, production is inevitably in decline.

Chart 7 shows central projections, but the 
actual level of UK production will be depend 
on a number of factors, and crucially on 
the level of investment and the success of 
further exploration. So far, around 40 billion 
barrels of oil equivalent have been produced 
in the UK, and as much as 20 billion, or more, 
could still be produced. To obtain full benefit 
for the UK from the remaining resources, it 
is essential that the UK continues to attract 
substantial further investment in a context 
of fierce international competition, and to 
maintain the presence of oil companies 
with the skills to identify and exploit these 
opportunities. 

The Government has acted to support  
the necessary levels of investment and 
activity, including:

encouraging new exploration, including 
in areas already explored, by quicker 
turnover of licences and by offering as 
much territory as possible for exploration;

35. 60% of final gas use is for residential sector.




104 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

encouraging further development in 

existing fields;

developing the tax regime so that it 
continues to offer the right incentives  
for new investment.

The UK has been able to maintain continued 
strong interest from the industry in both 
offshore and onshore exploration and 
development. The last offshore round in 2008 
resulted in the offer of 171 licences, the 
highest ever. The immediate prospects for 
investment are affected by higher levels of 
uncertainty stemming from the substantial 
fall in prices last year. But Budget 2009 
introduced a new “Field Allowance” to 
give incentives for investment in small or 

technically challenging fields. The recently-
published report of the House of Commons 
Energy and Climate Change Committee 
welcomed the introduction of the new 
allowance, and its analysis confirmed that it is 
likely to bring forward a significant tranche of 
projects. It nevertheless expressed concern 
that investment would not be sufficiently 
high without wider reforms of the fiscal 
regime. The Government will be considering 
that issue, alongside other actions which 
might help to sustain activity levels and 
skilled employment. 

The area to the west of Shetland  
contains much of the resources not yet 
exploited. But new gas infrastructure is key 
to further development of the area, and until 
recently was lacking. However, the first major 
gas development in the area now seems 
likely, following the discovery of the Tormore 
field. On current planning, new infrastructure 
able to deliver gas to market could be 
available in 2014.

 Chapter 4: 105
 Transforming our homes and communities

International strategic 
partnerships

The UK has imported gas for many years and 
will continue to do so.36 The diversity of our 
gas supplies helped the UK to remain largely 
unaffected by the Russia–Ukraine dispute in 
January 2009 (see box 7). 

With domestic supplies declining and 
imports forming a greater proportion of 
overall gas supplies, the UK has a strong 
interest in improving the functioning of the 
global gas markets. Currently, most gas is 
traded bilaterally on long-term contracts 
and transported via pipelines. Gas can also 
be transported in ships as a liquid, allowing 
supplies to come from a greater variety of 
sources, and the liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
market is growing every year.37

The Government engages with a wide 
variety of countries, bilaterally and through 
the EU, to establish international strategic 
partnerships, and to provide the conditions 
for diverse and reliable gas supplies to the 
UK. For example, it works with Norway, 

Qatar, Turkmenistan, Nigeria and Algeria 
among others. 

The Government also works multilaterally 
through the EU and other international 
bodies, including the International Energy 
Agency and the International Energy Forum 
to encourage the development of the global 
gas market. Issues that are particularly 
important include future investment in 
exploration and production of gas reserves, 
market transparency and functioning, and 
future technological developments, for 
instance those to exploit unconventional 
sources of gas.

As part of the European Union, the UK 
Government is taking steps together with its 
EU partners to improve how the EU’s internal 
gas market functions, which will in turn 
strengthen security of supply in the UK and 
across the EU. The recently agreed “Third 
Package” of legislation on EU electricity 
and gas markets, is a big step forward. It 
contains a range of measures to encourage 
investment and improve the regulatory 
framework so that energy markets can work 
more efficiently.

The EU will soon revise the existing Security 
of Gas Supply Directive to help manage 
potential disruptions to Europe’s energy 
supplies in a more co-ordinated and effective 
way. Similarly, the EU is working to ensure 
that it has diversity of energy sources, types, 
and routes by which they can be imported. 
This is important as the amount of gas that 
Europe imports as a proportion of total 
consumption will rise significantly in  
coming years and much of this will come 
from one source: Russia. The EU has 
therefore prioritised the development of 
a Southern Corridor route to increase the 
diversity of Europe’s energy supply by 
bringing gas from the Caspian, via Turkey,  
to the heart of Europe.

By 2020, indigenous gas supplies are likely to meet 
around half of our annual gas needs

36.  The UK imports gas from a range of countries including: the Netherlands, Norway, Qatar and Algeria.
37. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a flexible and convenient way to transport gas to/from areas beyond the reach of gas pipelines. The gas is cooled to 

-161oC in the producer state, which turns the gas into a liquid and has the effect of shrinking its volume to 1/600th of its gaseous form. It is then 
loaded onto specially built LNG tankers and shipped around the world. The receiving terminals store the gas in large cryogenic chambers (on par 
with the size of the Albert Hall) until it is needed, when it is regassified by warming it up and then sent into the national grid




106 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Improving our capacity  
to import 

Indigenous North Sea resources supported 
about three-quarters of UK gas demand in 
2008. But by 2020 this might have fallen 
to around 50% of our net annual demand. 
And, at times of peak demand in winter, UK 
production will contribute a much smaller 
proportion of demand and we will depend 
heavily on both gas imports and storage. 
To help manage the risks of this increasing 
dependence, the UK is developing a mix of 

gas import infrastructure and storage. The 
UK has a highly liberalised gas market which 
relies on companies to identify and address 
problems and these have brought forward 
gas import facilities, through both pipelines 
and as LNG. The UK now has three major 
pipes bringing gas direct from Norway and 
two from the Continent, and LNG can be 
imported at three sites.38 

The UK’s gas import capacity has increased 
more than five-fold over the last decade as 
a result of private sector investment, and 

Box 7
Our experience during the Russia-Ukraine dispute last winter,  
and arrangements for this winter

The Russia-Ukraine gas dispute last 
winter saw a reduction in supplies of 
Russian gas to Ukraine from 1 January 
2009, which escalated into a total cut off 
in Russian gas passing through Ukraine 
to Europe from 7 to 20 January. This 
had a significant impact on a number of 
countries in Europe, with some declaring 
states of emergencies. 

The UK’s diverse sources of gas imports 
meant that we experienced little direct 
effect, as we import very little of our 
gas from Russia. However, the dispute 
led to pressure on supplies in Europe to 
meet demand, and to the UK exporting 
gas to continental Europe in response to 
rising prices. Our experience last winter, 
compared to experiences in the winter 
of 2005-06, showed that the diversity 
of our supply sources and routes, 
and the recent expansion of import 
infrastructure, have strengthened our 
position against unexpected  
supply shocks. 

A longer disruption, particularly if 
combined with a prolonged period of 

cold weather or additional disruptions 
to supply, could have resulted in 
greater pressure on prices. Although 
the immediate risks to UK security of 
supply were extremely low, the dispute 
highlighted some scope for improving 
our gas security of supply arrangements, 
to help manage supply-side shocks. 

Against this background, National  
Grid is proposing some changes to 
the market framework for this coming 
winter. These include improved 
information and safety arrangements 
for gas storage and improved incentives 
for gas shippers to deliver gas into the 
system during an emergency. 

Following the Russia–Ukraine dispute 
and UK lobbying, the Spring European 
Council agreed to bring forward 
the proposed revision of the 2004 
Gas Security of Supply Directive. 
This is aimed at increasing Member 
State resilience to supply shocks, 
and improving emergency response 
mechanisms across the EU.

Government introduced the 2008 Planning 
Act to reform planning consents procedures, 
and this will enable the timely development 
of onshore gas storage projects, and the 
2008 Energy Act paves the way for a 

consents regime for offshore proposals, such 
as storage and unloading facilities. The new

108 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The outlook for our gas supplies in the 
short and medium-term is looking relatively 
positive. The recent expansion of import 
infrastructure and the diversity of gas 
supplies means that there is excess capacity 
to meet demand during severe weather 
conditions, in all but the most extreme 
instances of supply failure (see chart 8). 

Further action

However, there are some risks that, because 
of their size, rarity and unpredictability, 
reduce the incentive for commercial 
operators to insure against them - although 
the public might expect otherwise. In the 
light of these, the Government will continue 
to take action to maintain the security of our 
gas supplies, by:

Ensuring the regulatory and fiscal 

regimes for the North Sea attract and 

support the exploration and investment 
required to secure maximum benefit from 
the UK’s hydrocarbon resources.

Facilitating the construction of new  

gas import and storage infrastructure, 
in particular through reforming the 
consents regime.

The Government will shortly issue a 
commentary on the UK’s ability to cope 
with severe demand and major gas supply 
shocks to 2025.

Malcolm Wicks MP has reviewed 
how the UK can maintain secure 
energy supplies during the transition 
to a low-carbon economy; his report 
will also be published soon.

 Transforming our homes and communities

Preparing our homes 
and communities for 
the changing climate
Using the planning system

The Government has built into the planning 
system clear expectations on adaptation to 
climate change: national policy statements on 
nationally significant infrastructure projects, 
regional strategies and local development 
documents must all take account of a 
changing climate. The Government has 
updated planning policies so that regional 
and local planners use information about our 
future climate to deliver planning strategies 
that secure new development in ways that 
minimise vulnerability and provide resilience 
to climate change.

The Government is consulting on 

legislation to substantially strengthen 

local flood risk management and make 

it a legal requirement to prepare flood 

risk assessments taking account of 

the latest climate projections. The 
Government has supported Sir Michael 
Pitt’s recommendations following the 2007 
floods. This includes additional funding to 
support the development of surface water 
management plans in high priority areas. 
The Government will consult on improving 
delivery of our planning policies on flooding.

Making buildings resilient

Our current building standards already help 
to ensure that our buildings are able to 
cope with future climate change, but the 
Government will also be considering the 
latest climate change projections as part of 
its on-going programme of review.

The Government has already made it a 
requirement on the builder to consider heat 
gains as well as heat losses in domestic 

buildings, and new minimum water efficiency 
standards for all new homes will come 
into force in October 2009.41 Through the 
planning system, regulation, public funding 
and voluntary standards (such as the Code 
for Sustainable Homes), the Government 
is promoting strategies for adapted 
buildings–including green space and shading; 
passive ventilation; reflective glazing; water 
efficiency; sustainable drainage of  
rainwater; and water re-use.

112 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The Transition Plan to 2020 involves  
two kinds of fundamental change  
in our workplaces:

Reducing emissions: The energy we use 
in our workplaces accounted for 12% of 
UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2008.1 To 
reduce emissions, we will need to change 
the way we do business to cut down the 
amount of energy and other resources we 
use, potentially saving businesses billions 
of pounds.

New business opportunities: Many more 
of us will find ourselves working in a 
growing low carbon industry. Already 
880,000 people in the UK work in the 

low carbon and environmental sector, a 
rapidly growing worldwide market worth 
£3 trillion per year and £106 billion per 
year in the UK. By 2020, this could rise to 
more than a million people if we seize the 
opportunity to establish the UK as a global 
centre of low carbon industries and green 
manufacturing. Around 200,000 of these 
new jobs by 2015 are expected to be in 
renewable energy, which could grow by a 
further 300,000 additional renewables jobs 
by 2020 as set out in the UK Renewable 
Energy Strategy, a total of half a million 
additional UK jobs in the renewable energy 
industry to 2020.2 In doing this, the UK 
will need to focus on low carbon sectors

2. Department of Energy and Climate Change analysis
3.  The emission and emission saving estimates in this chapter refer to greenhouse gas emissions from combustion of (gas, oil, and coal) in 

business and the public sector buildings where this is not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).  This will include the use of 
fuel in non-domestic buildings for heating and cooling as well fuel use for industrial processes where the industrial installations are below the 
EU ETS threshold.




 Chapter 5: 113
 Transforming our workplaces and jobs

where we are likely to have a competitive 
advantage such as offshore wind, marine 
energy, civil nuclear power, carbon capture 
and storage, renewable chemicals, low 
carbon construction and ultra-low carbon 
vehicles, and specialist financial and 
business services.

This Transition Plan, along with wider policies, 
will cut emissions from our workplaces by 
13% on 2008 levels; help businesses grasp 
the opportunities arising from the transition 
to a low carbon economy; manage the costs 
associated with making this change; and 
secure the energy businesses need (see 
chapter 3).

The Government will help reduce emissions 
from workplaces by:

Including high-carbon industries in the EU 
Emissions Trading System.

Incentivising business and public sector 
workplaces to save energy through 
measures such as the Climate Change 
Levy, Climate Change Agreements and the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment.

Providing advice for all workplaces on how 
to cut their carbon emissions and reduce 
their resource use. 

To help make the UK a world centre of the 
green economy the Government is:

Investing in the low carbon industries 
of the future, including by using the 
£405 million of funding for low carbon 
investment announced in April 2009 to 
deliver a major boost to technologies 
where the UK has great potential, as 
described in more detail in the UK Low 
Carbon Industrial Strategy, published 
in parallel with this Transition Plan. This 
includes up to £120 million of investment 
in offshore wind, and investment of up to 
an additional £60 million to cement the 
UK’s position as a global leader in marine 
energy, and help develop the South West 
of England as the UK’s first Low Carbon 
Economic Area.

Using other elements of the £405 million 
of funding for low carbon investment 
to deliver up to a further £10 million 
of support for ultra-low carbon vehicle 
infrastructure. The Government will also 
use up to £6 million to accelerate our 
progress towards a smart electrical grid 
and up to £6 million to support exploration 
of deep geothermal power – a new and 
innovative form of renewable energy.

Supporting businesses through the global 
financial crisis and facilitating access to up 
to £4 billion of new capital for renewable 
and other energy projects from the 
European Investment Bank.

Helping workers to develop the skills 
needed to thrive in a low carbon economy.

To make sure the transition happens in a fair 
way, the Government is:

Providing loans and grants to help small- 
and medium-sized businesses and the 
public sector to afford upfront costs of 
those energy-efficient and low carbon 
technologies that will bring their energy 
bills down.

Minimising impacts for all types of 
business by ensuring markets are 
competitive, providing a range of support 
and incentives for business to become 
more efficient and acting to keep EU 
frameworks fair.

4.  Businesses’ use of electricity also contributes to emissions; the transformation of the power sector is covered in chapter 3.
5.  Innovas (2009)

The scale of the task
The transition will involve both reducing 
emissions from workplaces, and creating 
new jobs through maximising the business 
opportunities from low carbon goods 
and services. Around a sixth of the UK’s 
greenhouse gas emissions are generated as 
a result of heating our workplaces, in addition 
to which, some businesses, such as steel 
makers, also burn fossil fuels as part of their 
industrial processes.4

The global industry in low carbon and 
environmental goods and services is already 
worth £3 trillion a year, and could grow to 
well over £4 trillion by the middle of the 
next decade. This offers an opportunity for 
the UK to capitalise on its advantages and 
establish itself as a world centre of green 
manufacturing. The UK low carbon sector is 
worth £106 billion a year – 3.5% of the global 
green sector – and employs 880,000 people.5 
A clear strategy for the development of low 
carbon industry across the UK’s economy 
is vital if we are to realise the benefits this 
will bring, and preserve and enhance our 
competitive position internationally.

All workplaces will need to play their 

part in this transformation, but reducing 

emissions will be difficult because of a 

number of challenges:

Reducing emissions is not seen as a 
strategic priority for many organisations, 
and many businesses and public sector 
organisations do not yet understand how 
they need to change.

There is a big variety in the age and 
condition of the buildings we work in, and 
so a variety of solutions are needed.

 Transforming our workplaces and jobs

Until technologies are familiar and  
proven, people and businesses are  
often understandably reluctant to  
use them, or are unaware how well-
developed, robust and cost-effective  
‘new’ technologies have become.

Finding money to pay for new technologies 
is difficult, even for energy and resource 
efficient technologies where businesses 
get the money back quickly.

Many businesses rent their premises  
and landlords can lack incentives to  
make changes.

Businesses wishing to develop and  

sell new low carbon technologies  

also face challenges:

Getting access to long term capital can 
be difficult because the longer payback 
periods and risk of technology failure can 
put businesses and investors off, especially 
with the current constraints in the credit 
market. This challenge is particularly 
difficult for small- and medium-sized 
businesses with limited or no track record.

Other countries are also moving to take 
advantage of new low carbon opportunities 
and there will be global competition to lead 
the future low carbon industries. 

Making the most of new opportunities will 
require employees to develop new skills.

116 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The plan to 2020
The policies set out in this plan will ensure 
emissions from our workplaces are cut by 

13% on 2008 levels, and help businesses 
capture the opportunities from the move to 
a low carbon economy, whilst keeping the 
financial impact on businesses down. 

This Transition Plan sets out how the 
Government will act to help every business 
manage the costs of making the change to 
low carbon while taking up its opportunities. 
There is a real chance for businesses to gain 
in two ways.

First, businesses can realise significant 

and long-term savings by reducing 

emissions from their workplaces. If all 

UK business undertook cost effective 

measures then collectively £6.4 billion 

could be saved – 2% of UK profits. The 

Government will support business by:

helping businesses to reduce 

emissions, and 

taking action to lead the way in the 

public sector on emissions savings.

Second, the growth of the £3 trillion global 
low carbon industry offers the chance for our 
businesses to invest in new opportunities 
and create new jobs. The UK Low Carbon 
Industrial Strategy, published in parallel with 
this document, sets out in more detail how 
the Government will work alongside business 
to make sure the UK is well placed to 
succeed as a centre of green manufacturing. 
The Government will help business to 
benefit from this growing international 
marketplace by: 

Grasping the benefits of new economic 

opportunities, and 

Helping to manage the costs of making 

the transition to a low carbon world

Alongside these opportunities, it will be 
essential that UK businesses are able to rely 
on secure gas and other energy supplies as 
set out in Chapters numbers.

Reducing 
emissions from 
our workplaces

Helping businesses  
to reduce emissions

Introducing caps and  
incentives for businesses  
to reduce emissions 

The Government is committed to working 
with businesses of all sizes to make 
the emissions reductions that all of our 
workplaces need to achieve. Underpinning 
the Government’s strategy for larger, more 
energy intensive businesses is the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), 
which since 2005 has put a cap on about half 
of the UK’s CO


2

 emissions including those 

from more carbon intensive businesses such 
as those producing steel and cement. The 
system has already played a role in guiding 
business investment decisions. By 2020, it 
will guarantee annual emissions reductions 
of around 500 million tonnes of CO


2

 across 

the EU when compared to 2005, and 
there will be further reductions once there 
is a comprehensive international climate 
agreement. Further details about the EU ETS 
are set out in chapter 3.

Until there is an international agreement, the 
small number of sectors that are genuinely 
at significant risk of “carbon leakage” 




 Chapter 5: 117
 Transforming our workplaces and jobs

(business going overseas to avoid restrictions 
on greenhouse gas emissions) will receive 
free allowances under the EU ETS. These 
free allowances will be given on the basis 
of stretching performance benchmarks set 
at the level of the most carbon-efficient 
businesses in each sector. 

The Government is also helping many 
other businesses which, while large, are 
less energy intensive than those covered 
by the EU ETS, to reduce their emissions 
by introducing the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment to drive a reduction in their 
energy consumption. This new scheme, 
which will begin in April 2010, will require 
large non-energy intensive organisations 
to purchase carbon allowances, the total 
amount of which will be limited from 
2013 onwards, to cover their energy use 
emissions. Revenue raised from the sale 
of allowances will then be recycled to 
participants according to how they perform in 

reducing emissions. An annual league table 
ranking the performance of all participants 
will also be published. 

The scheme is expected to deliver substantial 
cost savings of around £1 billion by 2020 due 
to savings in energy bills. And we expect 
carbon savings to be at least 4.4MtCO


2. 

The level of the cap on emissions under the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment is expected 
to be set in 2012 following advice received 
from the Committee on Climate Change in 
2010, and some experience of the scheme’s 
operation.

The Government has also introduced the 
Climate Change Levy (CCL) to encourage 
businesses across the economy to use 
energy more efficiently and Climate Change 
Agreements (CCAs) to incentivise energy 
intensive businesses to take action while 
remaining competitive.

6. No decision has been made on the future of CCAs beyond 2017

The Climate Change Levy is an energy tax, 
the aim of which is to encourage businesses 
to use energy more efficiently. It is charged 
on energy supplied to business and the 
public sector, but not, for example, on 
renewables or on good quality combined heat 
and power plants. Fuel supplied for electricity 
generation and most fuels supplied for 
transport are also excluded. 

Climate Change Agreements were 
established to mitigate the impact of the 
Levy on the competitiveness of energy 
intensive industry, whilst also securing 
uptake of energy efficiency opportunities. 
CCAs are voluntary agreements between 
government and industry that enable eligible 
energy intensive businesses to obtain an 
80% discount from the CCL in return for 
meeting challenging, but cost effective, 
energy efficiency or carbon saving targets. 

The Climate Change Agreements and Levy 
are estimated to save around 23 million 
tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2010, 
despite strong output growth in many of 
the sectors involved, and businesses with 
Climate Change Agreements are currently 
estimated to save around £1.7 billion annually 
in energy costs when compared to baselines. 

The current Climate Change Agreements 

end in 2013. Subject to State aid approval 

they will be extended to 2017.  The 

Government is consulting on the form 

and content of the new agreements. 
Negotiation of targets with industry for the 
new CCAs has yet to start. However, the 
Government believes there is significant 
scope for additional cost effective emissions 
reduction by sectors currently covered by 
CCAs. We therefore intend to review the 
potential, to deliver at least 8 million tonnes 
of cost effective greenhouse gas abatement 
in the non-traded sector in the second and 
third carbon budget periods.6

Combined heat and power (CHP) plants, 
which provide more efficient, cost effective 
energy by harnessing the heat created 
as a by-product of power generation, are 
supported by exemptions from the Climate 
Change Levy. The Government announced 
in Budget 2009 that the current exemption 

from the Climate Change Levy for good 

quality CHP electricity sold to the grid 

will be extended by a further 10 years to 

2023, subject to further state aid approval. It 
is estimated that this long-term market signal 
will help to unlock an additional £2.5 billion of 
investment in large-scale CHP projects.

 Chapter 5: 119
 Transforming our workplaces and jobs

Currently, most refrigerators and air 
conditioners in commercial buildings and 
in all vehicles use fluorinated gases as the 
refrigerant. These make up almost 2% of UK 
emissions. To set a regulatory framework 
to enable businesses to reduce emissions 
from the products they sell, the Government 
has worked at European level to develop 
legislation to reduce EU/UK fluorinated gas  
emissions which has succeeded in reducing 
emissions by 39% since 1995. 

Other action at EU level is also helping to 
reduce emissions, including the Energy 
Performance of Buildings Directive, which 
includes measures relating to Energy 
Performance Certificates, Display Energy 
Certificates for public buildings, inspections 
for air conditioning systems, and advice and 

guidance for boiler users. The Government is 
also helping businesses to save energy and 
resources in other ways such as proposals 
being explored through the Government’s 
consultation on the roll-out of smart gas and 
electrical meters to households and certain 
smaller non-domestic customers. Budget 
2008 announced an ambition for all new non-
domestic buildings to be zero carbon from 
2019, and for new public sector buildings to 
be zero carbon from 2018.7

Providing financial support 

The Government helps businesses that 
would otherwise find it hard to pay for new 
technology, to get the finance upfront. 

The Government-funded Carbon Trust 
helps to cut carbon emissions by 
providing business and the public sector 
with expert advice, finance (including 
interest free loans) and accreditation, and 
by stimulating demand for low carbon 
products and services. Through this 
work, Carbon Trust helped save over 17 
million tonnes of carbon, delivering costs 
savings of over £1 billion, between 2001 
and 2007/08. Carbon Trust also helps cut 
future carbon emissions by developing 
new low carbon technologies through 
project funding and management, 
investment and collaboration and by 
identifying market failures and practical 
ways to overcome them.

7.  The Definition of Zero Carbon Homes and Non-Domestic Buildings consultation, published on 17 December 2008, set out the Government’s 
current thinking in this area. The Government is currently analysing the responses and will consult later in 2009 on more detailed proposals.

120 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Small and medium-sized businesses find 
securing financing particularly difficult, 
especially in the current economic context. 
In 2007/08 over 700 Government-backed 
interest free loans through the Carbon Trust 
helped businesses save around £9 million 
a year. In April 2009 the Government 
announced a further £100 million of 

available funding to enable up to 2,600 

more businesses in England to save 

money over the next two years. Extra 
financial help is also available to a wider 
range of businesses investing in some of the 

14,000-plus products which are eligible for 
the Enhanced Capital Allowances Scheme, 
helping them to realise further savings. 

But the Government realises that this will 
not roll out low carbon energy fast enough. 
So it is introducing a “clean energy cash 
back” scheme for workplaces that produce 
their own energy renewably (the feed-in tariff 
from 2010), and which install renewable heat 
technologies (the renewable heat incentive 
from 2011). Further details are set out in 
chapter 4 (Transforming our homes and 
communities).

Leading the way in the 
public sector
Central government and the wider public 
sector must lead the way in reducing their 
own carbon emissions and driving the move 
to a low carbon economy. The public sector 
is directly responsible for around 1% of UK’s 
emissions. Public sector emissions have 
already reduced by a third between 1990 and

Nursery retailer Precious Little One needed 
an efficient heating system that would pay 
its way in the long term, without adding to 
its immediate financial burden. An interest-
free loan of £10,000 from the Carbon Trust 
allowed the company to install an energy-

efficient replacement for its old heating 
system. Annual savings are estimated at 
over £5,000 making the payback period  
just two years, and saving an estimated  
27 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions 
every year.

2007, compared to an 18% reduction by the 
UK economy as a whole. The Government 
has plans in place that will deliver a 

total reduction of 16.9% across central 

Government offices by 2010/11,8 against 

a target of 12.5%. The Government’s 
ambitions for the public sector will be 
reflected in the departmental carbon budgets 
described in chapter 2, and will incorporate 
emissions savings from tens of thousands of 
public institutions.

Government departments have been set a 
target of a 30% reduction in their own estate 
and operations emissions by 2020 from 1999 
levels. This target will be incorporated into 
departmental carbon budgets and exceeds 
that set for the economy as a whole (34%, 
but against 1990 levels). 

The Government will be using up to £1.75 
million of low carbon investment funding 
to support the creation of a flagship district 
heating scheme for London in partnership 
with the London Development Agency. 
The Government will fund the installation 
of a new heat main and combined heat and 
power plant, to create an integrated scheme 
with the potential to deliver annual savings 
of 10,000 tonnes of CO


2

, and savings to 

heating bills for those connected. Adjacent  
Government departments and other public 
sector buildings will be encouraged to 
connect to the scheme.

Budget 2008 announced the Government’s 

ambition for new public sector buildings 

to be zero carbon from 2018. In addition, 

action is taking place across the public 

sector:

All new schools will be zero carbon  
by 2016 and the higher education  
sector is developing a carbon reduction 
strategy. Over the next fifteen years, all 
secondary schools and up to 50% of 
primary schools will be refurbished to be 
better adapted to climate change and have 
lower carbon footprints.

The NHS plans to reduce the level of its 
2007 emissions by 10% by 2015, and has 
developed a strategy to achieve this.

35 Local Authorities have committed to set 
targets in their Local Area Agreements to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
their operations, and all authorities will be 
required to report progress against these 
national indicators, with outcomes publicly 
reported from November 2009. 

Action is being taken to save emissions across the 
public sector

122 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Over 160 of the Government’s 261 
overseas diplomatic posts have taken 
action to reduce their environmental 
impact. Projects undertaken have been as 
diverse as connecting the Ambassador’s 
Residence in Stockholm to district heating 
and piloting solar panels for water heating 
in Nairobi.

In addition to targets, emissions from all 
central Government departments, larger 
public sector organisations and state schools 
will be limited by inclusion in the forthcoming 
Carbon Reduction Commitment. The public 
sector is also incentivised by the climate 
change levy and CHP exemption set  
out above. 

To ensure that the public sector leads the 
way and that it implements measures to 
reduce emissions rapidly and effectively, the 
Department of Energy and Climate Change 
is working with HM Treasury to establish a 
cross-cutting review of energy efficiency in 
the public sector.

Information and advice is just as important 
as setting targets and helps workers to think 
about reducing emissions. The Carbon Trust 
Public Sector Carbon Management service 
has helped 440 public sector bodies to 
identify savings of around £200 million. This 
means they can aim for ambitious carbon 
reduction targets of up to 28% over the  
next five years.   

The Government will also provide targeted 
financial support where appropriate, and 
is considering plans to support a series of 
demonstration sites across the public  
sector estate and in major public buildings. 
These demonstration schemes will  
accelerate the deployment of ultra efficient 
lighting where the technology is ready – for 
example replacing halogen spotlights in  
cafes, atria, corridors and floodlighting  
with light emitting diodes. 

After its creation in October 2008, the 
Department of Energy and Climate 
Change took over a G-rated Government 
building – the lowest rating available. 
The Department has enlisted the Carbon 
Trust’s help to conduct a carbon survey 
of its buildings and develop a carbon 
management plan to progressively 
reduce annual emissions, making 
changes to optimise its heating, 
ventilation and cooling systems as 
well as its head office lighting using 
motion and daylight sensing. These 
are designed to achieve an ambitious 
goal of a reduction of 10% of the 
building’s greenhouse gas emissions in 
the 2009/10 financial year, and further 
reductions beyond this.

Making finance easy for public 
sector organisations

Just like private businesses, public sector 
bodies can have difficulty paying for energy 
efficient improvements up front. To address 
this, loans for the public sector are available 
through a scheme operated by Salix Finance. 
In April 2009 an additional £54.5 million was 
made available to, among other organisations, 
schools, leisure centres, Local Authorities and 
central Government departments in England. 
This will reduce public sector energy bills by 
around £14 million a year, showing energy 
savings can be both good for climate change 
and for public services.

In April 2009, the Government announced 
an additional £45 million to provide grants for 
small-scale renewable technologies through 
the Low Carbon Buildings Programme, 
helping homes, charities, businesses and  
the public sector to invest in renewable 
energy technologies.

Benefitting from 
the low carbon 
economy

Grasping the benefits 
of new economic 
opportunities
The global move to a low carbon economy 
is creating ever growing demand for low 
carbon technologies, goods and services. 
The Government wants the UK to be a global 
centre for the green manufacturing that will 
deliver this technology.The UK must be not 
only at the forefront of using renewable 
energy and other low carbon technologies, 
but also of building and exporting them, with 
the jobs and economic opportunities that 
go along with that. For example, a recent 
study estimated that carbon capture and 

storage technology could bring between 

£2 and 4 billion a year into the UK 

economy by 2030, and support between 

30,000 and 60,000 jobs.9




124 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The UK Low Carbon Industrial Strategy, 

published in parallel with this document, 

sets out the scale of potential business 

opportunities and a programme of 

Government action. The Government is 

acting to support business by putting in 

place a coherent framework of support 

and opportunity: 

Providing targeted support for 

innovation and investment in the UK.

Supporting businesses through the 

global financial crisis.

Developing the skills needed for a low 

carbon economy.

Targeted support for innovation 
and investment in the UK

UK businesses are in a strong position 
to lead the way in key sectors including 
offshore wind and marine energy, civil 
nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, 
low carbon construction, low carbon 
vehicles and specialist financial and business 
services such as green venture capital or 
environmental consultancy that support 
the low carbon sector. Information and 
communication technology will also be a 
critical enabler of low carbon activity across 
all these sectors.

Bringing new and innovative technology 
to market is essential not only for UK 
businesses to compete in the low carbon 
market, but also as part of the global effort 
to combat climate change effectively. 
Both domestic efforts and international 
collaboration are needed to develop the 
technology that will be fundamental to 
making a cost-effective change to a global 
low carbon economy.

The Government already works through 
international fora, including the IEA, G8, 
G20 and the Major Economies Forum to 
enhance the development and deployment 
of low carbon technologies, focussing 

on technologies that will produce the largest 
greenhouse gas reductions. This has involved 
working closely with the IEA on energy 
technology roadmaps, collaborative R&D, 
capacity building and funding of technology 
deployment.  

Barriers exist, however, to UK businesses 

exploiting the country’s potential 

advantages which the Government must 

help to overcome. Budget 2009 announced 

£405 million of new funding to help secure 

the UK’s status as a global centre of low 

carbon industries. In Investing in a Low 

Carbon Britain, published on 23 April, the 

Government announced that this funding 

would be used to encourage businesses 

to invest in the UK through support for 

innovative low carbon technologies, 

and the development of our low carbon 

industry and its supply chain. 

The funding supports a range of initiatives 
including support to communities and 
householders detailed in chapter 4 and to 
help the public sector to take a lead as set 
out earlier in this chapter. The UK Low Carbon 
Industrial Strategy sets out a range of activity 
that will be brought on by this funding with 
further announcements to follow. Current 
plans include:

Offshore wind: 

The Government has earmarked up to 
£120 million to support a step-change in 
investment in the development of the 
offshore wind industry in the UK.  This 
includes funding for new offshore wind 
energy manufacturing facilities; investment 
in the development of next-generation and 
near-market offshore wind technologies 
through large scale demonstration; and  
improvements to the UK’s capability in 
integrated offshore wind testing including 
through dedicated testing facilities. 




 Chapter 5: 125
 Transforming our workplaces and jobs

Marine:

The Government is allocating up to 
an additional £60 million for a suite of 
measures which will help accelerate the 
development and deployment of wave  
and tidal energy in the UK and will cement 
our current position as a global leader in 
the sector.

The Government will double its financial 
support to Wave Hub – the development 
of a significant demonstration and testing 
facility off the Cornish coast – with 
up to £9.5 million of investment. The 
Government is also proposing to invest 
up to £10 million at NaREC, the New 
and Renewable Energy Centre, in the 
North East to build on and utilise existing 
infrastructure to provide an open access 
facility for marine developers to test and 
prove designs/components onshore. 
The Government will also provide up 
to £10 million to support the South 
West’s significant potential for wave 
and tidal energy deployment, research, 
demonstration and engineering, and up 
to an additional £8 million from the UK 
Environmental Transformation Fund to 
expand the in-sea stage testing facilities 
at EMEC, the European Marine Energy 
Centre, in the Orkneys.

In addition the Government will launch a 
Marine Renewables Proving Fund which 
will provide up to £22 million of grant 
funding for the testing and demonstration 
of pre-commercial wave and tidal stream 
devices. This will accelerate wave and tidal 
technologies’ move towards commercial 
demonstration and assist the development 
of successful projects under the Marine 
Renewable Deployment Fund. Taken 
together, these investments will provide 
the UK with unparalleled testing and 
demonstration facilities.

Ultra-low carbon vehicles:

The Government is providing up to a 
further £10 million for the accelerated 
deployment of electric vehicles charging 
infrastructure in the UK. And will establish 
a new cross-Whitehall Office for Low 
Emission Vehicles (OLEV) that will drive 
policy delivery. This will complement 
the £20 million for infrastructure, £140 
million for research, development and 
demonstration under the Technology 
Strategy Board’s Low Carbon Vehicle 
Innovation Platform, and £230 million for 
consumer incentives announced earlier 
this year.

A ‘Smart’ electrical grid

To accelerate the UK’s progress towards a 
smart electrical grid capable of integrating 
generation and consumption of energy 
more effectively than ever before, the 
Government will provide up to £6 million 
to complement other funding for network 
innovation such as Ofgem’s Innovation 
Funding Initiative amongst other sources. 
Government funding for smart grids will be 
used to support early stage development 
of trials of key technologies consistent 
with a vision for smart grid in the UK to be 
published later in 2009 (See chapter 3 for 
further details on the development of a 
smart grid).

Low carbon construction

Renewable resources can  substitute 
for oil based materials in a wide range 
of other non energy applications, for 
instance construction products, industrial 
chemicals, and plastics. The Government 
is  investing up to £6 million to construct 
60 more low carbon affordable homes 
built with innovative, highly insulating, 
renewable materials.  The new scheme 
will demonstrate the viability of these 
materials, and act as a spur for the 
renewable construction materials industry. 
It will also and to engage the affordable 
housing sector in the low carbon agenda.

Deep geothermal power

Deep geothermal power is an 
innovative energy technology that is seeing 
a surge in interest worldwide.  It uses the 
natural heat from deep underground to 
drive turbines at the surface, providing a 
renewable and non-intermittent source 
of electricity and heat.  The Government 
will commit up to £6 million to explore 
the potential for deep geothermal power 
in the UK, helping companies carry out 
exploratory work needed to identify viable 
sites.  As it matures, this technology could 
become a significant player in the UK’s 
energy landscape. Past estimates 
have suggested that deep geothermal 
power from the South West of England 
alone could meet 2% of the UK’s annual 

electricity demand10, potentially creating 
thousands of jobs in the building and 
running of new power plants.

Nuclear energy

The Government will provide capital 
investment to establish a Nuclear 
Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre 
that combines the knowledge, practices 
and expertise of manufacturing companies 
with the capability of universities. This 
will complement the existing Advanced 
Manufacturing Centres in Sheffield and 
Glasgow and the Nuclear Laboratory in 
Sellafield. The facility will enable around 
30 companies to work together on 
the development of processes for the 
manufacture of nuclear components and 
assemblies, to develop management

In addition to the specific support provided 
through this new funding, the Government 

recognises that getting new technology 
off the drawing board and into production 
can take more than a decade and is often 
prohibitively expensive. Business can also 
face challenges in securing the right funding, 
support and access to facilities to test and 
demonstrate new technologies, and can be 
deterred by the high level of risk investing in 
new technology represents. The Government 
will therefore ensure professional and 
financial assistance is given to businesses 
developing new low carbon technologies 
(see figure 1), which shows just some of the

The Government will develop a model 
for selecting ‘technology families’ with

and UK economic benefit, recognising 
that the UK’s geography, capability, skills 
and manufacturing base gives us a strong 
starting point as a leader in a number of 
low carbon technologies.

development of market-led technology 
clusters for low carbon energy 
developers.

Alongside this action and investment, the 
Government wants to respond to calls from 
business for ever more effective delivery of 
innovation support for low carbon and, in 
particular, energy generation technologies. 
As a result, the Government plans to make 
a number of changes to the way it supports 
innovation, which are set out in box 6 on 
previous page. 

The UK Innovation Investment Fund 

announced in Building Britain’s Future, 

was set up to invest in technology-based 

businesses with high growth potential, 

including low carbon. The Government 

will invest £150 million to leverage  

equal private sector investment, which 
the Government believes could build this  
into a fund of up to £1 billion over the next 
ten years.

Targeted action in England’s 
regions

The Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) 
are acting to provide regional leadership 
on energy and climate change, through 
the development and delivery of Regional 
Strategies, including energy and carbon 
reduction plans and targets, and supporting 
regional partnerships. RDAs play a key 

North West England is home to one 
of the world’s largest concentration of 
nuclear facilities and a workforce with an 
internationally renowned skills base and 
technological expertise. The sector employs 
over 40,000 people and the National Skills 
Academy for Nuclear which is an employer 
led body develops skills training to support 
a sustainable future for the UK nuclear 
industry. The North West Development 
Agency contributed £6 million to ENERGUS 
in Workington. As the new flagship facility 
for the National Skills Academy for Nuclear, 
ENERGUS is a new world-class centre for 
high-level vocational skills. ENERGUS will 
directly train 250 apprentices and assist 
in educating under- and postgraduates 
elsewhere.

David Barber, head of training for British 
Energy, which is part of EDF Energy said: 
“With the increase in demand for quality 

skills across all sectors of the nuclear 
industry it is absolutely essential we have 
the confidence in our capability to meet 
this, both for our own workforce and that of 
our supply chain. We see the National Skills 
Academy for Nuclear as the key enabler 
to broker the provision of both provider 
capacity and quality skills.”

strategic role in the regions, understanding 
and supporting the growth of sectors which 
will underpin low carbon growth such as 
construction, transport and low carbon 
technologies, and leading regionally specific 
activity on low carbon innovation, research 
and development. 

To help take advantage of the unique 
character of each region, the Government is 
developing Low Carbon Economic Areas to 
accelerate low carbon economic activity in 
areas where Britain’s existing geographic and 
industrial assets give a region clear strengths. 
The first Low Carbon Economic Area will be 
located in the South West of England and will 
focus on the development of marine energy 
demonstration, servicing and manufacture. 
The South West has an obvious marine 
resource, successful existing activity with 
high potential and a high level of regional 
expertise in marine research, development 
and engineering. 

Supporting businesses through 
the global financial crisis

Swift action to minimise the risks facing the 
economy at home and abroad has been taken 
by the Government. It has been devised to 
ensure that the UK is best placed to make the 
most of the recovery when it comes about. 
Measures to support businesses’ access 
to finance include: the Enterprise Finance 
Guarantee, Capital for Enterprise Fund and 
a Trade Credit Insurance Top-up Scheme to 
help maintain levels of trade credit insurance 
to ensure businesses can continue to access 
the finance they need.

In addition UK renewable and other 

energy projects stand to benefit from 

up to £4 billion of new capital from 

the European Investment Bank. The 
Government believes that this can bring 
forward £1 billion of consented small and 
medium-sized UK renewables projects to 
deployment.

Developing new skills for a low 
carbon economy

The growing low carbon industry in the UK 
can flourish only if workers have the right 
skills to meet the demands that businesses 

Equipping our workforce with the right skills is an 
essential part of the transition to low carbon




130 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

will face. For example, workers in the 
construction sector will need the right skills 
to build and install small-scale renewable 
energy technologies, and to install the full 
range of measures that will make homes 
and businesses more energy efficient in 
both new and existing buildings. They will 
need to know how to build new low carbon 
infrastructure such as that required to make 
renewable energy and nuclear power.  

Many of the skills needed are not new. The UK 
will need to increase the supply of science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics 
skills, for example, as well as identifying 
mechanisms for transferring them to new 
contexts. And skills already developed within 
the offshore oil industry, which is supported 
by its own skills academy, OPITO, will be 
highly relevant to carbon storage projects and 
some renewables projects offshore. But many 
specialist skills will be new, and a major cross 
sector effort will be needed to gear up the 
skills system to deliver those. 

Key areas of activity are:

Ensuring degree courses reflect the 
specialist skills essential for working in 
the nuclear and construction sectors. 
The Office for Nuclear Development is 
monitoring this and working alongside the 
sector bodies to develop a skills plan for 
targeted education and training.

Renewable energy also requires specialist 
skills. The Office for Renewable Energy 
Deployment is working with industry 

on a strategy for skills in wind, wave 

and tidal energy and is also establishing 

the National Skills Academy for Power.

Low carbon sector skills will feature 
prominently in a long-term active skills 
strategy that will be published later in 2009.

Low carbon skills will be a part of every sector of the economy

$80 / barrel oil price in 2020. This is dealt with in the Analytical Annex.

Managing the costs of 
transition to low carbon
There will be costs as well as opportunities 
from the transition to a low carbon economy.  
The measures set out in the Transition Plan 
will put upward pressure on energy prices 
and bills. The Government estimates that 
the additional impact in 2020 of the policies 
in this Transition Plan, relative today, is 
equivalent to approximately a 15% increase 
from current energy bills for an average 
business. When previously announced 
climate policies are included this figure  
is 17%.

The increase in energy bills is caused by the 
use of renewable generating technologies 
that are most expensive than electricity from 
fossil fuels at today’s prices. However, much 
of this increase is offset by energy efficiency 
policies in this Transition Plan.13

Government is working to ensure that 
impacts are minimized for all types of 
business by:

Ensuring competitive energy markets 
deliver affordable energy

Incentivising energy saving

Ensuring EU frameworks are fair  
to business

The Regional Development Agencies will 
have a key role to play in ensuring their 
regions maximise the opportunities emerging 
from the transition to a low carbon economy.

134 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Our domestic transport currently contributes 
a fifth of total UK greenhouse gas emissions, 
and these are growing. International travel 
also produces greenhouse gas emissions. 

This Transition Plan, along with wider policies, 
will cut emissions from domestic transport 
by 14% on 2008 levels, as set out in more 
detail in Low Carbon Transport: A Greener 
Future, published alongside. This chapter sets 
out the actions the Government is taking 
to encourage the development of radically 
different new technologies and fuels to 
decarbonise transport in the long-term,  
and to secure the oil supplies needed  
during the transition.

Highlights of the plan include:

Continuing to improve the fuel efficiency  
of new conventional vehicles: 

Cutting average carbon dioxide 
emissions from new cars across  
the European Union to 130g/km from 
2012 with full compliance by 2015, and 
to 95g/km by 2020, a 40% reduction 
from 2007 levels.

To ensure that the Government leads 
by example, it has set targets for 
government departments and their 
agencies to procure new cars for 
administrative purposes that meet 
the EU standard for 2015 in 2011, four 
years early. The Government will set 
revised emissions requirements for new 
administrative cars later this year, to 
ensure the use and development of  
ever greener vehicles in its fleets.

136 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

1. Results presented here may differ marginally to those in Low Carbon Transport: A Greener Future because they are generated by two different 
models, the Energy Model and the National Transport Model. For more detail of the differences between the models see: http://www.dft.gov.uk/
pgr/economics/ntm/roadtransportforcasts08/rtf08.pdf. The domestic transport sector includes all journeys (either passenger or freight) by road, 
rail, air and waterways within the UK. Flights and journeys by sea that begin in the UK but end in a foreign country (and vice versa) are classed 
as “International Aviation” and “International Shipping” and are not counted in our carbon budgets and emissions reductions targets for the time 
being, due to the lack of a globally agreed methodology to allocate responsibility for these journeys to individual countries.

2. The emission and emission saving estimates in this chapter refer to greenhouse gas emissions from use of primary fuel used by road transport, 
non-electric trains, military aviation and shipping, domestic shipping and domestic aviation up to 2012 (after which it is covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System). Emissions associated with electrified transport are included in emission figures from power and heavy industry

The scale of the task
The transport system supports economic 
prosperity – it provides us with access to 
goods and services by allowing businesses 
to transport these efficiently from suppliers 
to markets, and it provides people with 
the freedom to get around. Our domestic 
transport currently contributes 22% of total

UK greenhouse gas emissions.1 The majority 
of this is produced by our cars. Transport 
emissions from journeys made in the 
UK have increased by 12% since 1990. 
We must find cleaner ways to travel and 
transport goods, not only in the UK but also 
internationally, and secure the supplies of fuel 
that are required for transport.

The plan to 2020
The policies set out in this Transition Plan, and 
in more detail in the Low Carbon Transport: 
A Greener Future, will ensure that by 2020 
we cut emissions from transport by 14% on 
2008 levels and secure the oil supplies the 
UK needs during its transition to a low carbon 
economy. The Government needs to ensure 
that the transport system also addresses 
goals beyond carbon reduction, such as 
reducing congestion, improving safety, 
security and health and promoting greater 
equality of opportunity for everyone. The 
Plan will bring wider benefits, for example, 
local air quality will be improved and noise 
nuisance will be reduced with the greater use 
of low emission vehicles: particularly electric 
vehicles, and through a switch to low carbon 
modes of transport like walking and cycling.

There are considerable challenges  
to overcome:

Our existing vehicles, fuels and 
infrastructure are very well established 
and our economy and lifestyle have built 
up around them. There are strong links 
between transport and people’s lifestyle 
choices. Many people see little reason to 
make greener travel choices. Others may 
wish to do so, but may not have or be 
aware of lower carbon ways to travel.

The transport industry has taken huge 
strides over the years in improving services 
and technology, for example safety 
technology. We also need to ensure that 
the industry directs its innovative energies 
towards a long-term climate change 
agenda. New technology requires major 
investment but is essential to prevent the 
impacts of significant climate change.




 Chapter 6: 137
 Transforming transport

4. Department for Transport (2009) Low Carbon Transport: A Greener Future

The UK cannot effectively reduce 
international emissions in isolation. 
Commitment and collaboration  
therefore needs to be built at the  
European and global levels to ensure  
an effective approach.

The UK is becoming more dependent 
on imported crude oil and is increasingly 
dependent on imports of diesel and 
aviation fuel.

The reality is that not all of the necessary 
changes will happen without the Government 
taking a strategic role, because of the nature 
and extent of the challenges described 
above. The Government’s Low Carbon 
Transport: A Greener Future, published 
alongside this Transition Plan, sets out in 
more detail the action that the Government 
is taking now to decarbonise our transport 
system.4 This Transition Plan summarises 
some of that action:

The first step is to improve the efficiency 
of our conventional vehicles so they emit 
less greenhouse gases.

We must move away from petrol and 
diesel in the long-term. So the Government 
is supporting the vehicles and fuels 
of the future and the radically different 
technologies needed.

Cutting transport emissions is not just 
about changing technologies. So the 
Government is helping people to make 
low carbon travel decisions.

Emissions from international flights and 
ships are growing and the only effective 
way to tackle this is internationally. So 
the Government is pushing hard for 
an international agreement to reduce 
emissions from international aviation 

and shipping. 

The Government is also acting to secure 
the oil supplies the UK needs at a fair 
price during the transition to low carbon 
transport.

driving down emissions 

Putting the plan 
into practice

Improving the 
efficiency of our 
‘conventional’ vehicles

Providing the right regulatory 
environment 

In a new car today people can travel  
9% further using one litre of fuel than  
was possible in a car manufactured ten  
years ago.5

Recognising that more could be achieved, 
in 2008 the EU established a mandatory 
target for manufacturers. From 2012, the 

target for average emissions from new 
cars sold in Europe will be 130g of carbon 
dioxide per kilometre, phased in to ensure 
full compliance by 2015. From 2020, average 
carbon dioxide emissions from new 

cars sold in the EU must further reduce 

to 95g of carbon dioxide per kilometre 

travelled. This represents a 40% reduction 
in emissions per kilometre from 2007 levels. 
The UK was among the leading European 
countries in calling for this longer-term target.

To ensure that the Government leads by 
example, it has set targets for government 
departments and their agencies to procure 
new cars for administrative purposes that 
meet the EU standard for 2015 in 2011, 
four years early. The Government will set 
revised emissions requirements for new 
administrative cars later this year, to ensure 
the use and development of ever greener 
vehicles in our fleets.

Conventional vans can also be made to 
be more efficient. The Government is 
determined to ensure an ambitious and 

achievable framework for long-term 

emissions reductions is applied to vans, 
and is actively engaging with the European 
Commission as it develops its proposals.

Encouraging the cleanest 
vehicles onto our roads

If everyone buying a car today were to 
choose the most fuel-efficient model 
available, in the class of car they wanted, 
we would make huge emissions savings. To 
promote this, car showrooms are required 
to display information about carbon dioxide 
emissions on all new cars; this is done using 
a colour-coded label (see figure 1). The Low 
Carbon Vehicle Partnership is seeking to 
develop a similar label for used cars; and 
for vans an online database was recently 
launched by the Government.6 

The Government also encourages the  
right choices with financial incentives.  
For example, vehicle excise duty and 
company car tax have already been 
restructured to encourage people to  
choose lower emission cars.

Encouraging the cleanest buses  

and trains 

Like cars and vans, buses and trains can 
be made more efficient. Hybrid buses are 
already on the market, and can reduce 
carbon emissions by 30-40% compared to 
conventional buses. Transport for London has 
56 hybrid buses in operation, and plans to 
have 300 more on London’s roads by 2011.

The Government will invest up to £30 

million over 2009-10 and 2010-11 in low 

carbon bus technology, helping operators 
to cover the additional upfront cost of buying 
low carbon buses. This is expected to lead to

the delivery of several hundred low carbon 
buses over the next two years. This builds on 
the Government’s decision in 2008 to give 
operators running low carbon emission buses 
an additional 6p per km, as part of the Bus 
Services Operator Grant.7

Rail technology can also be made more 
efficient and is receiving similar government 
backing. The Government has committed to 
setting an environmental target for the rail 
industry for the period 2014-2019 (through 
the ‘High Level Output Specification’).

Supporting the vehicles 
and fuels of the future 
In the long-term, reductions in emissions 
will require a radical transformation in 
the way vehicles are built and powered – 
whether hybrid, electric vehicles, biofuels 
or hydrogen fuel cell technology. The chart 
below is only illustrative, but gives a sense 
of the technological breakthroughs that 
might take us from our current conventional 

road vehicles, through to ultra-low carbon 
vehicles in 2050. The Government wants 
to of the technological breakthroughs that 
might take us from our current conventional 

road vehicles, through to ultra-low carbon 
vehicles in 2050. The Government wants to 
make the UK a leading place in the world 
to develop, demonstrate and manufacture 
low carbon vehicles (see chapter 5) and has 
committed around £400 million to encourage 
development and uptake of ultra-low carbon 
vehicles. This includes funding for RD&D 
under the Low Carbon Vehicle Innovation 
Platform. 

This timeline does not mean we have to 
wait for decades to see how these vehicles 
might look and feel to drive. Over the next 
18 months around 500 electric and lower 
carbon cars and vans will take to UK roads 

The Government is investing up to £30 million by 
2011 to help bus operators buy low carbon buses

Box 1
Types of ultra-low carbon vehicle 
technology

Hybrid Vehicle: combines electric 
power from an on-board battery with 
a standard internal combustion engine 
running on petrol, diesel or biofuels. 
In a ‘‘plug-in hybrid’’ a larger battery 
is used and charged from an external 
source, allowing the vehicle to be used 
in electric mode for longer distances.

Electric Vehicle: uses a battery large 
enough to make all trips in electric only 
mode and does not use an internal 
combustion engine or liquid fuel. 

Hydrogen and Fuel Cells: hydrogen 
can be used to provide energy for 
transport, through use in a fuel cell 
vehicle or internal combustion engine. 
In one type of a fuel cell vehicle, the 
hydrogen is split, and combined with 
oxygen from the air, which produces 
electricity to power the vehicle.

through Government programmes. This 
includes the largest project of its kind in

represents the first time that these vehicles 
will have been used. Eight different locations 
will showcase the electric car trials, including 
Oxford, London, Glasgow, Birmingham and 
the North-East. In addition, 12 public sector 
organisations will trial low-carbon vans.8

To help new electric cars become 
competitive, from 2011, the Government 
will provide financial assistance worth in 

the region of £2,000 to £5,000 to reduce 

the price of electric or plug-in hybrid cars. 
This Government policy, announced in April 
2009, will help make these models more 
competitive for motorists.

10. This includes £20 million investment to launch the Sustainable Bioenergy Centre; £6 million for the Advanced Bioenergy Directed Research 

Accelerator investigating the potential of algae for biofuels; and an intention to provide financial support for the creation by industry of a biofuels 
demonstration plant, which would use organic waste material to produce bioethanol and renewable power.

Moving to low carbon sources 
of energy in transport

As well as transforming the types of road 
vehicle we use, we will also need alternative 
fuels to replace diesel and petrol. New fuelling 
infrastructure may be needed to replace our 
existing network of petrol stations. Electricity, 
hydrogen and biofuels may all play a part. 
Diversifying our fuel sources will also help 
improve our energy security. 

Using electricity in transport

Electricity is likely to become a major 
transport fuel. Current electric road vehicles 
are more efficient than internal combustion 
engine vehicles. To help kick-start the 
new electric charging infrastructure, the 
Government is providing up to £30 million 

for electric vehicle charging points in six 

or so cities and regions, from next year.

There is a good case for rail electrification. 
About 40% of the rail network is electrified 
accounting for about 60% of passenger 
travel.  As well as reducing carbon dioxide 

emissions, electric trains are faster, more 
reliable, can take more passengers, and 
have less impact on air quality than diesel 
trains. The Government has undertaken 
work to look at this case more closely and 
will shortly set out our plans for a major 

programme of rail electrification.

Further, as the UK electricity supply is 
increasingly decarbonised (see chapter 3)  
the benefits of using electricity in transport 
will become greater. 

Using sustainable biofuels  

in transport

Fuel made from renewable resources such 
as plants or waste cooking oil, called biofuel, 
is already an option to complement petrol 
and diesel. Biofuels can play a valuable 
role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
and promoting security of energy supplies, 
by reducing our need for imported oil. The 
Gallagher Review warned that unsustainably 
produced biofuels have the potential to 
increase net greenhouse gas emissions, 
and there is a risk that certain biofuels may 
be displacing existing agricultural production 
onto areas of high biodiversity and indirectly 
causing greenhouse gas emissions.9 Similarly 
the Government does not want to support 
biofuels that excessively compete for 
land with existing food crops, as this may 
contribute to food price rises.

The UK is a world leader in trying to ensure 
that biofuels are produced in a sustainable 
way, and has an ambitious biofuels research 
and development strategy.10 The Government 
is also working internationally to establish 
voluntary global sustainability criteria. 

Today’s cars can be run on conventional fuel 
mixed with biofuel. The Government has 
made the use of biofuels mandatory through 
the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. 
Suppliers must ensure that the share of

11. By the end of 2014 the European Commission will undertake a review of, amongst others, the cost-efficiency of the measures to be implemented 
to achieve the target and the feasibility of meeting the target sustainably.

biofuels increases to 5% of the fuel blend 

by 2013-14. The Government has committed, 
under the EU Renewable Energy and Fuel 
Quality Directives, to go further to: 

 source 10% of the UK’s transport energy 

from renewable sources by 202011

 achieve a 6% reduction in greenhouse 

gas emissions from transport fuels  

by 2020.

These targets will primarily be met through 
the use of sustainably produced biofuels.

The Government is also examining the use of 
biomass sourced fuels in aviation. Trials have 
recently been carried out by the industry. 
The UK is working to resolve safety and 
sustainability issues and the Government is 
encouraging the industry to plan for greater 
use of alternative fuels.

Helping people to make 
low carbon decisions
Technology is clearly important in reducing 
transport emissions, but other changes will 
also be needed. There are already choices 
that all of us can make, as individuals 
and businesses, which would reduce the 
environmental impact of our journeys.

Helping people to make  
smarter journeys

Raising awareness of alternatives to car 
travel can cut emissions and reduce the 
UK’s oil needs. Large urban areas are now 
competing to become England’s first 
Sustainable Travel City. The Government 

announced in May that the winning area 

will get up to £29 million to invest over 

three years. This scheme was announced 
following successful five-year pilots of 
Sustainable Travel Demonstration Towns in 
Darlington, Peterborough and Worcester. 
The Demonstration Towns reported that car 
trips fell by up to 9%, walking increased by 
up to 14%, and cycling increased by up to 
12%. The towns used personalised travel 
planning, travel information and marketing, 
and improved infrastructure. 

£140 million is being spent between  

2008-11 to promote cycling in England. 
The Government is now developing a 
National Cycle Plan to further promote 
cycling; and is making available £5 million 
over two years to radically improve cycling 
storage facilities at up to ten major railway 
stations nationwide; and to help people to 
integrate rail and cycling. 

Our cars can already run on a mix of biofuel 
and conventional fuel. By 2013-14, biofuels will 
constitute at least 5% of the fuel blend in the UK

Rail passenger numbers have grown by 
50% in the last 10 years, with further growth 
predicted. Over £10 billion will be invested 
in enhancing rail capacity between 2009 and 
2014, with overall Government support 
for the railways totalling £15 billion. The 
case for more high-speed rail services is 
being explored. And £2.5 billion per year 
is invested by the Government on bus 

services in England, including £1 billion on 
concessionary fares for older people and 
those with disabilities. 

Smarter distribution

To shift freight off the road and on to other 
modes of transport, the Government’s 
Sustainable Distribution Fund provides 
grants to use rail and waterways instead. To 
date, this programme is estimated to have 
removed 880,000 lorry journeys from British 
roads. With funding from the Government, 
the Tesco train link from Daventry to 
Grangemouth has saved over three million 
miles of road journeys per year.12

Planning future transport networks to 

reduce emissions

The existing planning and appraisal processes 
for transport infrastructure and policy already 
take account of environmental impacts. 
Carbon dioxide reduction must now also 
become a greater consideration. The 
preparation of new Local Transport Plans 
and integrated Regional Strategies over the 
next two years represents an important 
opportunity to deliver this change. The 
Government is working with regional and 
local partners on best practice in transport 
delivery, and a suite of guidance will be 
available to local authorities as they develop 
new Local Transport Plans by April 2011.

Helping people to drive in the 
most efficient way

Eco-driving techniques, such as pumping up 
tyres and driving at an appropriate speed, 
reduce the engine’s workload, meaning less 
fuel is burned and less carbon dioxide is 
produced. The Government is promoting 
these techniques through the Act On CO


2 


campaign and the Energy Saving Trust’s 

programme of smarter driving lessons, 

and making eco-driving part of the driving 

test.13 Drivers can reduce their fuel use by 
as much as 15% after one lesson. Van and 
lorry drivers also receive training in these

techniques,14 and bus drivers will 
be encouraged to use them through 
incentives in the Bus Service Operators  
Grant from 2010.15 

Transport taxes also play a part: fuel duty 
raises revenue to help fund public services 
and also incentivises fuel-efficient purchases 
and encourages more fuel-efficient behaviour.

Reducing emissions 
from international 
aviation and shipping
Aviation

The UK’s economy increasingly depends 
on air travel for exports, tourism and inward 
investment. Air travel has more than doubled 
since 1990 and this trend is forecast to 
continue over the next 20 years.16

Global agreement to reducing emissions from 
aviation is essential and the Government is 
pushing international forums to achieve this. 
The International Civil Aviation Organization 
has taken the first step, by agreeing global 
fuel-efficiency goals, discussing the need for 
carbon-neutral growth in the medium term, 

and absolute emissions reductions in the 
long-term. The Government will seek to build 
on this as part of an ambitious global deal on 
climate change at Copenhagen in December.

An EU government and industry body, the 
Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research 
in Europe, has set targets for aircraft 
manufacturers to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions from new aircraft by 50% per 
passenger kilometre and reduce emissions of 
nitrogen oxides (another greenhouse gas) by 
80%, relative to a 2000 base. 

While action is needed at the international 
level, the UK will also act domestically. In 
some cases, additional capacity will be 
needed in the UK to relieve the most acute 
pressure points on our transport networks. In 
January 2009 the Government announced its 
policy support for the expansion of capacity 
at Heathrow. Alongside this the Government 
announced a target to reduce UK aviation 
carbon dioxide emissions to below 2005 
levels by 2050, despite forecast growth in 
passenger demand. This target is the only 
one of its kind anywhere in the world. The 
Committee on Climate Change has been 
asked to advise on the 2050 target by 
December this year, including the basis for 

Box 2
The Government Car and Despatch Agency is leading the way with low 
carbon vehicles and reduced running costs 

Reducing emissions and running costs 
is not just about buying lower carbon 
vehicles, but also the way that vehicles 
are driven. This important factor was 
recognised by the Government Car and 
Despatch Agency. The Energy Saving 
Trust acknowledged the Agency’s driver 
training policy with its Fleet Heroes 
Smarter Driving Award in 2008. The 
training programme has dramatically  
cut fuel consumption.

Part of the approach is to monitor 
individual driver’s fuel consumption 
and offer re-training where required. 
In addition, Green Cars, the Agency’s 
taxi service for the Government and 
public sector clients, uses hybrid fuel 
cars. It produces half the carbon dioxide 
emissions of traditional black cabs. The 
Agency now runs the biggest low carbon 
taxi fleet in London.




146 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Measuring greenhouse gas emissions 
from international aviation and shipping 
and assigning them to individual 
countries is complex.

The Committee on Climate Change 
recommended that international 
agreements be put in place to cover 
emissions from international aviation 
and international shipping, but 
concluded that they should not, for 
the time being, be included in the UK 
national carbon budgets, because of 
the lack of a globally-agreed way of 
allocating emissions to the UK, or any 
other country. In the case of aviation, 
there are also difficulties in reconciling  
a UK allocation system with the 
approach taken within the EU Emission 
Trading System. 

However, international aviation into 
and out of Europe is included in the EU 
2020 target to reduce emissions by at 
least 20% compared to 1990, with the 
EU Emissions Trading System providing 
the legally-binding mechanism to ensure 
aviation’s contribution. The UK’s carbon 
budgets have been set based on the 
EU’s 2020 framework, factoring in the 
contribution from international aviation 
through the Emission Trading System. 
This means the Climate Change Act 
budgets out to 2022 and targets already 
take into account international aviation 
emissions. 

17. The Committee on Climate Change is the independent body established under the Climate Change Act 2008 to advise the UK Government on 
setting carbon budgets, and to report to Parliament on the progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

18. Funding to support strategic R&D initiatives identified by National Aerospace Technology Strategy has been provided by the Technology Strategy 
Board in partnership with Regional Development Agencies, Devolved Administrations and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

the target and on the range of factors that 
might contribute to meeting it.17

These reductions are expected to be 
achieved from a combination of measures, 
including more efficient aircraft, operations 
and air traffic management. The Government 
continues to promote the use of market 
mechanisms such as emissions trading to 
incentivise improvement. It also incentivises 
manufacturers to develop low-carbon engines 
and airframes in the UK through support 
for priority programmes identified by the 
National Aerospace Technology Strategy, 
and tax relief for research and development 
investment.18

From 2012, all flights arriving and 

departing from European airports – both 

domestic and international – will be part 

of the EU Emissions Trading System. 

Air operators will either need to reduce  
their emissions through more efficient 
planes, demand reduction, or the purchase 
of emissions allowances or through auctions 
from other participants in the scheme. 

Box 3
International aviation and shipping emissions and the UK’s carbon budgets

In January 2009, the Government announced 
a target to reduce UK aviation carbon dioxide 
emissions to below 2005 levels by 2050, despite 
forecast growth in passenger demand




 Chapter 6: 147
 Transforming transport

20. Such as crop failures or disruption in countries that produce fuels.

The Government is also reforming air 
passenger duty: expanding the number 
of distance bands, to continue to send 
environmental signals to passengers and 
the industry alike, and ensure the sector 
contributes fairly to public services.

Shipping

In 2007, shipping emissions accounted for 
roughly 7% of greenhouse gas emissions 
from UK domestic and international transport.19 
However, this proportion will grow as other 
modes of transport decarbonise over time 
and with the ongoing increase in demand  
for global trade. 

As with aviation, the Government is 
supporting an international policy framework 
to drive improvements, by:

Working within the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) to get agreement to 
measures to reduce CO


2

 emissions from 

ships, when the Marine Environment 
Protection Committee meets in July 2009.

Continue pressing for the agreement at 
Copenhagen to include a global sectoral 
target for maritime transport emissions 
that can be delivered cost-effectively and is 
consistent with limiting dangerous climate 
change to below two degrees compared 
to pre-industrial levels. After Copenhagen, 
the Government will work within the IMO 
to develop a new convention to deal with 
emissions from ships. The Government  
will continue to look at other options until  
a truly global solution can be found, or 
should progress within the IMO prove 
too slow, including proposals to include 
shipping emissions in a regional scheme.

Keeping our oil supplies 
safe and secure
We currently rely on oil for almost all of 
our motorised transport needs. Transport 
accounted for 75% of final consumption of 
oil products in the UK in 2008, amounting to 
51.9 million tonnes of oil.

In the longer term we need to reduce our 
dependence on oil. As set out above, we 
plan to do this by improving vehicle efficiency 
and using new alternative fuelled vehicles. 
Increasing the proportion of biofuels in 
transport will add to the diversity and 
reliability of our fuel sources, although there 
are some risks in importing biofuels.20

Over the period of this Transition Plan oil will 
continue to be very important in meeting our 
energy needs, including for transport, and is 

Transport accounted for 75% of the UK’s final 
consumption of oil products in 2008




148 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

likely to be used longer still in aviation and 
shipping. Demand for oil is set to rise through 
to 2020 in the UK, driven by higher demand 
for diesel oil in motor transport and aviation 
fuel. The UK needs to ensure it has safe and 
secure supplies of the oil products it requires. 
The Government’s approach includes:

maximising the economic exploitation of 
North Sea oil and gas (see chapter 4);

ensuring a well-functioning global oil 
market, and

improving our capacity to supply fuel.

A well-functioning global oil market

The UK is becoming increasingly dependent 
on imports of both crude oil and key 
petroleum products, such as diesel and 
aviation fuel. In 2008, 66% of the UK’s  
crude oil imports were sourced from  
Norway, with the majority of the remaining 
imports sourced from Russia, Algeria and 
Venezuela, and less than 1% from the Middle 
East. The UK currently relies on Middle 
Eastern countries, Singapore and Russia 
for aviation fuel. Diesel products are mainly 
sourced from EU countries and Russia. There 
is flexibility to source imports from a range of 
suppliers, so it is developments in the global 
oil market, rather than individual countries, 
that have the biggest impact on the security 
of the UK’s oil supplies. 

Improving the functioning and liquidity of 
international energy markets is important 
for energy security and to ensure a smooth 
transition to a low carbon economy. The 
immediate risk to oil production is not 
how much oil is left in the ground, but the 
world’s ability to convert these reserves into 
production now and in the future. A stable 
and fair oil price is a key UK objective, as it 
preserves economic growth and ensures 
investment in oil production, alternative 
technologies and energy efficiency. 

To this end, the UK has been working 

internationally to strengthen the dialogue 

between oil producers and consumers, 

including convening the London  

Energy Meeting in December 2008. 
The UK is continuing to pursue a range  
of actions internationally to try to reduce  
the risk of returning to excessively volatile  
prices, including: 

Working with international partners to 
remove barriers to future investment 

in oil production by encouraging stable 
regulatory frameworks internationally,  
by helping to develop the necessary  
skills base and encouraging further 
co-operation between national and 
international oil companies.

Asking the International Monetary  

Fund and the International Energy 

Agency to improve their surveillance 

of what is driving oil prices and the 
associated macroeconomic risks of  
oil market developments.

Pushing for full commitment from 

partner countries to provide timely  

and accurate data on oil demand, 
supply, stocks and investment.

Improving regulation, enforcement 

and transparency in commodity 
derivative markets, through asking partner 
countries to implement recent regulatory 
recommendations from the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions 
and considering what further steps could 
be taken to improve information on 
financial flows into commodity markets.

Supporting the International Energy 

Forum’s Expert Group to develop 
proposals on the appropriate institutional 
architecture in the global oil market  
and consider measures to address oil  
price volatility.




 Chapter 6: 149
 Transforming transport

Improving our capacity to supply fuel

The UK downstream oil industry comprises 
companies involved in the refining, 
distribution and marketing of oil products. 
There is a growing mismatch between UK 
refinery output and consumption, with 
increasing shortfalls in diesel and jet fuel, 
and surpluses of petrol and fuel oil. The UK 
exports surpluses to, and attracts imports 
from, the global oil market. The Government 
is working with the refining industry to 
review current and future challenges in 
refining, including the balance between 
product quality and product mix, future 
demand patterns, and the need to meet 
safety and environmental objectives. 

Within the UK, there has been a gradual 
contraction in oil supply and distribution 
infrastructure and its capacity. Over the  
next 12 months, the Government will be 
working with industry to identify barriers  
to investment in new infrastructure, and 
develop options to strengthen future 
domestic supply resilience. 

In relation to aviation fuel, the joint 
Government and industry Aviation Fuel 
Task Group is continuing to review demand 
and supply at UK airports, out to 2030, and 
will identify options for new fuel supply 
infrastructure to meet demand and improve 
levels of resilience by the end of 2010.

In order for the UK to be prepared for an oil 
emergency, the UK holds stocks of crude 
oil and oil products. The Government will be 
reviewing the industry-based compulsory oil 
stocks regime and, if there are better ways of 
delivering our international commitments to 
hold stocks, it will consult on options in 2010.

Preparing our transport 
system for our changing 
climate 
Our transport system will need to be able 
to cope with expected changes in climate. 
For example, roads and railways will need 
to be more resilient to heat waves and to 
intense rainfall, and ports and sea defences 
protecting coastal infrastructure will need  
to be more resilient to higher sea levels  
and storms.

The risks posed by climate change to our 
motorways and trunk roads are being 
identified by the Highways Agency in its 
Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. And 
Network Rail is developing ‘hazard maps’ 
to highlight rail infrastructure that may be 
particularly vulnerable. Through embedding 
adaptation into future transport planning 
policy, the Government is working to ensure 
it has the right frameworks in place to protect 
our strategic transport infrastructure.

The Government is planning ahead to ensure our 
strategic transport infrastructure can cope with the 
climate change we expect will occur in the UK

Transforming 
farming and 
managing our 
land and waste 
sustainably




152 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Farming and changes in land use are 
responsible for about 7% of UK  
greenhouse gas emissions. The Transition 
Plan, along with wider policies, will cut 
farming and waste emissions by 6% on 
2008 levels. The long term challenge for 
Government and farmers is to find ways of 
reducing emissions while safeguarding our 
environment and producing food sustainably, 
especially as the climate changes – but the 
transformation can start straight away.

The Transition Plan will also help protect the 
equivalent of over 37 billion tonnes of carbon 

dioxide that is currently locked into natural 
reservoirs of carbon in our soils and forests – 
an amount that goes up or down depending 
on how land is used. Good land management 
is vital for keeping these stores absorbing 
and locking away carbon dioxide rather than 
emitting it. 

When waste decomposes it releases 
methane, and this makes up about 4%  
of total UK greenhouse gas emissions.  
The Transition Plan will cut waste  
emissions by 13% on 2008 levels.  

Summary

The Government will support farmers to meet a new goal for reducing emissions while  
protecting our environment.




 Chapter 7: 153
 Transforming farming, and managing our land and waste sustainably

Highlights of the Transition Plan include:

Encouraging English farmers to take  
action themselves to reduce emissions  
to at least 6% lower than currently 
predicted by 2020, through more efficient 
use of fertiliser, and better management  
of livestock and manure.  

Reviewing voluntary progress in 2012,  
to decide whether further Government 
intervention is necessary. The  
Government will publish options  
for such intervention in Spring 2010.

Ensuring comprehensive advice 
programmes are available to support 
farmers in achieving this aim, to reduce 
their emissions from energy use, and to 
save money in the process.

Researching better ways of measuring, 
reporting and verifying agricultural 
emissions.

Encouraging private funding for woodland 
creation to increase forest carbon uptake. 

Support for anaerobic digestion, a 
technology that turns waste and manure 
into renewable energy.

Reducing the amount of waste sent  
to landfills, and better capture of  
landfill emissions.

154 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Compared to other sectors, there are much 
larger scientific uncertainties in estimating 
agricultural emissions and predicting the 
effects of changing practices. For example, 
the amount of nitrous oxide released from 
spreading fertiliser can depend on the soil 
type, the weather conditions, when and 
how the spreading was done, and many 
other factors.

1.  The Government decided to include greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide in the UK carbon budgets in line with advice from the 
independent Committee on Climate Change (see Building a Low-Carbon Economy: The UK’s contribution to tackling climate change pp 335 – 362, 
available from http://www.theccc.org.uk/reports/building-a-low-carbon-economy).

2.  The emissions and emission saving estimates in this chapter refer to greenhouse gas emissions from farming (including CO


2

 emissions from farm 

machinery other than tractors), land use, land use change and forestry, and emissions from landfill.

The scale of the task 
The vast majority of farming emissions come 
from methane produced by livestock and 
their manure, or nitrous oxide produced from 
fertilisers. Waste’s impact comes mostly from 
methane from rotting rubbish. By designing 
the carbon budget system to take account 
of these other greenhouse gases, the 
Government has introduced the first formal 
UK framework for tackling the impact of 
these sectors on climate change (see chapter 
two for more on carbon budgets).1

This framework will help farming to remain a 
strong and prosperous industry while joining 
with the rest of the UK in reducing its impact 
on our climate. Such reductions are essential 
– without new and concerted action then 
farms will account for over a third of the UK’s 
total allowable emissions by 2050.

Of these sectors, the bigger long term 
challenges are in farming, where: 

There are physical limits to how far 
emissions can be reduced. Farming 
involves complex natural cycles such as 
the gases produced by livestock reared 
for meat, dairy or wool. 

The world population will rise to more 
than nine billion by 2050 according to the 
United Nations. The UK must play its role 
in ensuring safe, affordable food supplies, 
balanced by the need for the sector to 
adapt to the impacts of climate change and 
safeguard environmental resources such as 
biodiversity and water quality.

Agricultural products are traded 
internationally. So in reducing emissions 
in the UK we need to make sure that  
we do not simply transfer the problem  
to other countries.

3. This figure is averaged over 2018 – 2022.
4.      Both historical figures and projections for agricultural emissions come with very large uncertainty ranges. Figures in this chapter have been

calculated using central estimates.

Farmers, land managers, foresters and other 
stakeholders must be involved in developing 
a consensus about the solutions, both at 
home and abroad, to these kinds of long 
term questions – but there are changes that 
scientists tell us should be made straight 
away to reduce emissions and bring other 
economic and environmental benefits.

The plan to 2020
This Transition Plan will:

Encourage English farmers to take action 
themselves to reduce yearly emissions 
from livestock and fertiliser by the 
equivalent of more than three million 
tonnes of carbon dioxide, compared 
with their current projected levels.3 By 
improving fertiliser efficiency, manure 
management, and livestock feeding and 
breeding, farming emissions will be 6% 
lower than they would otherwise be.4

Cut England’s yearly waste emissions 
by the equivalent of one million tonnes 
of carbon dioxide by 2020, on top of the 
reductions already predicted. This will 
reduce UK waste emissions to 13%  
below today’s levels.

This plan involves:

transforming farming

protecting and increasing our natural 
carbon stores, and 

reducing emissions from waste.

Farming – fertiliser efficiency, livestock 
feeding and breeding, and better manure 
management

Waste – reducing emissions associated 
with landfilling material such as food and 
wood that rots to release methane

156 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Putting the plan 
into practice

Transforming Farming 

Setting an aim

The Government’s intended saving for 
farming is based on the best available 
evidence, which shows it to be ambitious 
but realistic. The Government may set out a 
higher goal in future as evidence of effective 
practices grows5, but this demonstrates the 
level of effort the farming sector needs to 
make, which must begin now and increase 
progressively in the years ahead. 

Because most of the actions the Government 
expects farmers to take to reduce emissions 
also save money or increase productivity, it 
expects to see a proactive response from the 
sector and its leadership. The Government 
is now calling for the sector to agree on a 
voluntary basis, by Spring 2010, an action 
plan for reducing emissions.

The Government will review action taken 
by the sector in 2012 to decide whether 
voluntary action will be sufficient in getting 
agricultural emissions down far enough and 
fast enough. This review will use the best 
available proxy indicators of success while 
research to improve the measurement of 
agricultural emissions is still underway. 

The Government will work with farmers, 
delivery bodies, and the Devolved 
Administrations to develop a shortlist of 
options for intervention to be triggered in 
case of insufficient progress. 

This will consider new policies – regulatory, 
economic, voluntary, and advisory – 
including those used in other sectors 
of the economy and other countries. In 
addition to new initiatives, some current 
policies could be shaped to bring greater 
focus on climate change mitigation – for 
example, Environmental Stewardship, 
Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, and the England 
Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery 
Initiative. The Department for Environment, 
Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) will set out this 
shortlist as part of its climate change strategy 
in Spring 2010.

Focusing on cost-effective 
action by farmers

The Government recognises that globally, 
scientific evidence on how best to reduce 
agricultural emissions is at an early stage, 
and UK-focused studies commissioned by 
the Committee on Climate Change and  
by the Government do not yet agree on  
all the answers. 

However, all the studies agree that there 
are opportunities to reduce emissions 
and save money by making agricultural 
processes more climate friendly – including 
by using fertilisers more efficiently, and by 
improving livestock feeding, breeding and 

The Government wants to see a strong and 
competitive farming industry that starts making  
real progress in tackling its emissions. Better 
livestock management will be an important  
part of this process. 

5.  The intended saving for farming will also need to reflect the Government’s improving understanding of historic and future farm emissions. If 
scientific progress shows that today’s assumptions about current and future emissions are wrong then the intended saving may shift in line with 
the revised figures.




 Chapter 7: 157
 Transforming farming, and managing our land and waste sustainably

manure management. In common with other 
businesses, farmers and land managers must 
also benefit from reducing their emissions 
from energy use, including through energy 
efficiency measures that can save money. 

Supporting action by farmers 
and land managers

The Government believes that farmers and 
land managers should make the decisions 
on the ground about how to manage their 
land and their businesses, and it will support 
them to make voluntary changes to reduce 
all types of greenhouse gas emissions, which 
must be tackled together at the farm level.

The sector has already begun to take action. 
Key organisations formed a joint Climate 
Change Task Force in January 2007,6 and the 
Government also values the commitment and 
expert advice of the Rural Climate Change 
Forum7 in helping to tackle this issue and 
promote a thriving farming industry that meets 
consumers’ demands in a sustainable way.

Advice like this helps inform practical  
help from the Government, which includes 

bioenergy capital grants8, financial support 
for anaerobic digestion demonstration plants, 
England Catchment Sensitive Farming 
Delivery Initiative9, and payments under 
Environmental Stewardship.10

To provide further support, the Government 
will now:

Provide advice, and demonstrate how 

to take cost-effective action.

Case study: efficient use of nutrients

At Thorney Abbey Farm in 
Nottinghamshire, Andy and Sue 
Guy have saved money and reduced 
emissions through reducing the amount 
of inorganic fertilisers they use, by:

 carrying out their own analysis of the 
nutrient content of the manure and 
slurry from their livestock, and using 
this instead of inorganic fertiliser

 choosing the crops they grow to 
match them with the availability of 
nutrients in manures and soil, and

 carefully considering when and how 
they apply fertiliser to get nutrients to 
the plants at the right time.

Andy and Sue say that “the measures 
we’ve taken already have been quick and 
simple, with minimal outlay, but have 
yielded tremendous savings”.

158 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

and discussing these issues with farmers 
through the Rural Climate Change Forum, 
Farming Futures project, and the ‘climate-
friendly farming’ theme of the Act on CO

campaign, launched at the Royal Show in 
July 2009. The Government will now work 
with Natural England, the Environment 
Agency, Regional Development Agencies, 
the Carbon Trust, and other partner 
organisations to identify gaps in existing 
low-carbon advice, and develop more 
comprehensive services to fill them. This 
will make best use of Business Link, the 
Government’s single portal for advice  
to business. 

Support for energy efficient and 

low carbon farming. Within the limits 
imposed by the current EU rules on state 
aid, the Government and the Carbon Trust 
will work to make farming businesses 
eligible for its interest-free loans for low-
carbon activity (see chapter 5). The exact 
size of the loans available to farmers will 
depend on interest rates in the economy 
and whether they have received any other 
state aid, but the Government estimates 
that the maximum loan will be in the 
region of £30,000.

reporting, and verification of emissions, 
which has been shown to be possible in 
other countries such as New Zealand.

Maximise the potential of anaerobic 

digestion to produce renewable energy 

from farm waste and reduce emissions 

from manure. 
A Government-appointed Anaerobic 
Digestion Task Group has made 
recommendations for an Anaerobic 
Digestion Implementation Plan, published 
alongside this White Paper.11 The 
Government will respond later in 2009.

Decarbonising our 
whole food chain

Through these steps the Government will 
help to make agricultural production in 
England as greenhouse-gas-efficient, cost-
efficient, and competitive as possible. To 
find a long-term, sustainable way to feed 
ourselves safely and affordably in a low-
carbon world, the Government is also looking 
at how emissions throughout the food chain 
are affected by decisions by business and 
consumers – including what we buy and eat, 
and how much we waste.

Protecting and 
increasing our natural 
carbon stores
Soils and forests are large natural reservoirs 
of carbon: they lock away carbon dioxide, 
storing it through tree growth and various 
natural processes in a way that avoids it 
contributing to climate change. Scientists 
estimate that UK soils and forests are 
currently absorbing a small amount of carbon 
from the atmosphere every year. 

The total carbon stored in UK soils and 
forests is equivalent to over 37 billion tonnes 
of carbon dioxide – more than 50 times 
the UK’s annual emissions. Changes to the 
landscape (including building work, soil tilling 
and forest management) need to be done 
in a way that protects and where possible 
grows these stores, particularly as climate 
change itself is expected to affect natural 
processes in a way that could cause some of 
this store to be lost.

We need an approach that reflects all our 
needs – including reducing emissions, 
protecting and growing carbon stores, and 
providing goods and services to society in a 
sustainable way. 

The Government is committed to reducing 
emissions throughout the food chain, including 
greenhouse gases emitted during the distribution 
of food

160 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Looking after our soils

To fill gaps in our scientific knowledge – 
including whether the UK is losing or gaining 
soil carbon – the Government is spending 
£1.5 million each year on soil research. This 
includes work on protecting or increasing soil 
carbon, the likely effects of climate change 
(changes in temperature and moisture can 
lead to the breakdown of more organic 
matter and losses of carbon dioxide to the 
atmosphere), and new ideas like using 
“biochar” as a soil additive, which could lock 
up carbon dioxide in the soil and might also 
have useful benefits for crops.

Given the big potential impact of losing soil 
carbon, the Government is also taking action 
now where it is safe to do so, including a 
requirement on farmers to take steps to 
protect their soil. Over half of the UK’s soil 
carbon is stored as peat, so the Government 
is working with industry and stakeholders 
to reduce the extraction of peat for uses like 
multi-purpose compost and ‘grow’ bags. Over 
half of this market was ‘peat-free’ by 2007. 

Protecting, managing,  
and growing our forests

In 2007, forests in England removed a net 
total of about 2.9 million tonnes of carbon 
dioxide from the atmosphere. This removal 
rate is declining, as forests planted in the 
1950s to 1980s reach maturity. If woodland 
creation and removal continue at their 2007 
rates, it will drop to around half a million 
tonnes per year by 2020, and if woodland 
creation stops entirely it will fall to only a 
hundred thousand tonnes.

Woodland creation is a very cost-effective 
way of fighting climate change over the long 
term, but it requires an upfront investment. 
The Government is already doing this: 
woodland creation represents 60% of the 
grant aid administered by the Forestry 
Commission. But to realise the potential 
for 2050, we need to see a big increase in 
woodland creation – and we need to plant 
sooner rather than later.

The Government will support a new drive 
to encourage private funding for woodland 
creation. If we could create an additional 
10,000 hectares of woodland per year for 
15 years, those growing trees could remove 
up to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide 
between now and 2050. Well-targeted 
woodland creation can also bring other 
benefits, including a recreational resource, 
employment opportunities, flood alleviation, 
improvements in water quality, and helping 
to adapt our landscapes to climate change 
by linking habitats to support wildlife. The 
Government will ensure that woodland 
creation policies continue to respect the 
benefits and demands of landscape, 
biodiversity and food security.

This will allow businesses and individuals to 
help the UK meet its carbon budgets, whilst 
delivering the other benefits that woodlands 

Farmers’ management of soil is vital for protecting 
this important store of carbon.




 Chapter 7: 161
 Transforming farming, and managing our land and waste sustainably

can bring. A number of informal schemes 
already exist, and the Government will work 
with them and with the private sector to 
consider how it can build on and complement 
existing initiatives. The Government is 
already laying the groundwork: including 
through the consultation on a Code of Good 
Practice for Forest Carbon Projects led by the 
Forestry Commission, and the Government 
consultation on corporate carbon reporting 
guidelines12, which sets out how funding for 
domestic emissions reduction projects can 
be reported in company accounts. The Government will encourage the creation of new 

woodland to lock away carbon.

Box 2 
Are forests a reliable way to remove and store carbon?

Some people have raised concerns 
that carbon stored in forests is not 
safely locked away, because the trees 
could die or be chopped down and 
then release carbon as they rot. In 
the UK, we have a strong regulatory 
framework to protect woodlands and 
promote sustainable forest management 
– meaning that following felling, trees 
are replaced to ensure continuous 
woodland cover. Although the amount 
of carbon stored in the woodland 
temporarily declines following felling, 
this cycle reduces overall emissions in 
the longer term when the wood is used 
as a source of energy (woodfuel), or as 
a building material (where the carbon 

will stay locked up, and emissions 
from producing more energy-intensive 
building materials are avoided). The 
carbon stored in trees and wood 
products is accounted for by the system 
that the UK uses to record and report its 
greenhouse gas emissions.

The draft Code of Good Practice  
for Forest Carbon Projects, published  
by the Forestry Commission in July 
2009, will increase confidence in 
woodland creation projects by providing 
guidance on how to properly account 
for stored carbon, and by setting out 
requirements which projects must  
meet to become accredited.13

(www.wasteawarescotland.org.uk).

Reducing emissions 
from waste

Emissions from waste are already down 
62% from 1990 levels, and predicted to fall 
further from existing policies alone. But as 
it degrades, biodegradable waste produces 
methane, a powerful greenhouse gas – often 
for many decades. So the Government has 
decided to go further by:

Reducing the amount of waste produced. 
The Love Food Hate Waste campaign14 is 
reducing household food waste by over 

250,000 tonnes, and the Government’s 
recently announced measures to improve 
food labelling will have a further impact.

Putting even less of the waste we 
produce into landfills. The Government 
will encourage greater production of bio-
energy, particularly from combustion. It 
also plans to encourage more processing 
of food waste, agricultural waste, and 
sewage using ‘anaerobic digestion’ to 
produce biogas. The UK Government will 
be consulting later this year on banning 
certain materials or types of waste 
from landfill, including the most climate 
damaging substances; any such bans 
would be expected to come into force no 
later than 2020 and would work alongside 
polices such as landfill tax. 

Capturing more of the methane produced 
from existing landfill. The UK Government 
has asked the Environment Agency to 
consider ways in which control over 
landfill gas emissions could be tightened 
including, if necessary, tighter regulation.

Uncertainties remain about the science of 
landfill gas emissions and the best measures 
to reduce them, but the Government 
estimates that extra measures of this 

The Government’s strategy is to reduce the 
overall level of waste produced by households 
and business, and to send less waste to landfill 
– particularly substances that will breakdown to 
produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

In the English Midlands, The National 
Forest Company has attracted funding 
from a wide range of private sector 
companies, including SMEs, who choose 
to have their name connected with 
creation of woodland in the National 
Forest. Their research has shown that 
investors are attracted by a range of 
benefits, including the recreational 

facilities and wider environmental 
benefits provided by woodlands. 
Fighting climate change may not be at 
the top of their list initially, but moves up 
the agenda as they learn through their 
involvement with the forest. This means 
that as well as the carbon storage and 
other benefits, the scheme is helping to 
raise awareness of climate change.

type, together with the recently announced 
increases in landfill tax, might yield a further 
one million tonnes a year savings in carbon 
dioxide equivalent by 2020.

Box 4 
Protecting our marine environment

This chapter focuses on the sustainable 
management of our land, but the marine 
environment is also important. The 
world’s oceans currently take up around 
one quarter of the carbon dioxide we 
emit, but as they store more carbon 
the rate at which they can absorb our 
emissions is slowing.

The more carbon dioxide the oceans 
absorb, the more acidic they become. 
This is a serious threat to many marine 
organisms and could have wider 
impacts on food webs and ecosystems.

The Government is funding work to 
improve our understanding. In 2005, 
it helped to found the Marine Climate 
Change Impacts Partnership, which  
aims to make evidence and advice 
available to policy advisors and 
decision-makers. Earlier this year, the 
Government announced a five-year 
£11m study15 into ocean acidification, 
funded jointly with the Natural 
Environment Research Council.

The Marine and Coastal Access Bill, 
currently before Parliament, introduces a 
new system of strategic marine planning 
with sustainable development at its 
heart. This will enable the Government 
to take a more managed and coherent 
approach to the ways in which we use 
our marine resources.

The Government’s policies to 2020 set us 
on the path to transform the UK into a low 
carbon economy by 2050. However, the scale 
of the challenge of our goals for 2050 means 
that the Government, Ofgem, industry 
and consumers need to consider now, the 
possible pathways to achieving this goal – 
through 2030 and beyond. While no-one can 
say with certainty what the energy system 
will look like in 2050, there are two things 
that are likely to be true:

It will be more achievable and less costly 
to decarbonise the energy system if we 
significantly reduce overall demand for 
energy.

We will need at least as much, if not more 
electricity, which will come from a variety 
of low carbon sources. 

Both of these will involve substantial 
structural and behavioural change from all 
sectors of society, including large-scale public 
and private investment.

It is not possible to predict with complete 
certainty what 2050 will look like. Areas 
where there is greatest uncertainty include: 

How to balance the challenges associated 
with reducing energy demand with the 
costs and implications of increasing low 
carbon energy supplies.

The best combination of sources of low 
carbon energy, and in particular what 
technologies we will rely on to meet our  
long-term heating and transport needs.

The Government will work with industry and stakeholders to articulate a roadmap to a low carbon UK in 2050

Summary




 Chapter 8: 167
 Developing a roadmap to 2050

What is clear, however, is that securing 
low carbon energy for the longer term 
is a challenge that requires investment, 
innovation and integration of a scale without 
precedent in the energy sector. Given the 
importance of the task and the public policy 
choices involved, the Government will: 
continue to develop a strategic framework 
to decarbonise the UK based around carbon 

pricing; enable and shape major infrastructure 
and capacity building investments which 
have long lead times; and build consensus 
between industry, the Government and the 
public on the scale and nature of the changes 
required. The Government will publish a 
roadmap setting out the path to 2050 by 
spring 2010.

168 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

This chapter looks at some of the changes 
needed as we move through 2030 and 
towards 2050, and explains how the 
Government will work with industry, 
stakeholders and other experts to develop 
a more detailed roadmap to ensure that 
choices made today make sense for the 
long-term. It is important in doing so to 
recognise uncertainty in looking so far into 
the future; by 2050 we will use a wide variety 
of technologies, some of which may not yet  
be invented. Therefore, any roadmap will 
need to:

plan for action where the direction is clear

be responsive to changing circumstances 
as we move forward

foster testing and development of various 
options and technologies, and 

continue to build on a framework including 
a carbon price driving technological and 
behavioural change. 

There are a wide range of views on the best 
way to achieve our emissions targets. They 
have some common themes and goals, but 
with different means of achieving them. For 
example, recent analysis by the Committee 
on Climate Change and the CBI propose 
different policies and paths to decarbonise 
our electricity generation.1 As we move 
forward, the Government will continue  
to assess the full range of analysis as it  
develops and take action where appropriate 
to guide our path.. 

Planning now through 
2030 to 2050
Decarbonising our energy system will 
be a gradual process over the coming 
decades (chart 2). The primary driver of 
this decarbonisation will remain the three 

broad interventions set out by Lord Stern’s 
Review of the Economics of Climate Change 
(2006): putting a price on carbon emissions; 
driving new technologies; and helping people 
make low carbon choices. We will continue 
to use significant quantities of fossil fuels 
during the transition and may well do so 
even beyond 2050 (although in combination 
with technology that captures most of their 
emissions).

 Chapter 8: 169
 Developing a roadmap to 2050

As the changes expected by 2050 are so 
large and the time it takes to achieve them 
is so long, some of the decisions made 
today will have an impact on what the 
energy system will look like in 2030 and 
beyond. These changes will have significant 
implications for industry, businesses and 
consumers, so it is important that we 
develop a shared understanding of the 
choices available, the practical challenges and 
constraints to be managed in implementing 
them and their implications for society. 
Although we cannot know all the details of 
our future energy mix, we need to examine 
now whether we have the necessary building 
blocks in place to support this longer term 
transition. We must also consider the nature 
and timing of future key decisions in view of 
the necessary trajectory beyond 2020.

The Government has started this process 
and sets out here some of the issues and the 
further work we will carry out, with industry 
and others, including:

The initial conclusions we can draw  
from existing analysis.

What the role of reducing demand for 
energy might be.

What plans we need to put in place to 
cope with a potential increase in the 
demand for electricity.

The largest areas of uncertainty that  
need to be managed on the path to 2050.

The practical challenges that will need  
to be met.

How we will go about developing  
the roadmap we need to secure  
long-term changes.

The overall goal will remain to meet our 
emissions and renewable energy targets in a 
way that minimises the cost to our economy 
and maximises our living standards.

170 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Initial conclusions from 
the analysis
A range of analysis by independent experts 
and by the Government has described what 
a low carbon UK in 2050 might look like and 
what we need to do to get there. How we 
get to 2050 depends on technology costs, 
physical constraints (including how fast 
infrastructure can be built), global energy 
prices, global emissions targets, decisions 
made by individuals and businesses and the 
future policy choices of the Government.

Chart 3 shows a range of outcomes  
from a set of scenarios describing what  
the energy system might look like in  
2050. It shows that despite significant 
uncertainties, some challenges to our  
energy use and supply are clear enough for 
the Government, industry and consumers to 
debate, expect and plan for. 

We can be certain that all sectors are likely 
to undergo substantial changes, although the 
effort and rate of change in any one sector 
will depend on the degree of effort and rate 
of change in other sectors too. 

For example, although the optimal rate at 
which to reduce emissions from electricity 
generation will depend on how our 
heating and transport systems evolve, the 
Government recognises that most analysis 
points to the need to aggressively reduce 
emissions from electricity generation and will 
continue to act to do so. 

We will also need to continue reducing 
our non-carbon dioxide emissions (from, 
among other sources, agriculture, waste 
and industrial processes), as well as our 
emissions from aviation and shipping, and 
progress in these sectors will have a direct 
impact on the scale of emissions reduction 
needed from heat, power and transport. 

Where there are large uncertainties the 
Government will focus on understanding 

when pivotal decisions need to be taken, 
and what the sensible interim actions are 
to reduce the uncertainty and make the 
transition faster and more efficient. 

While the analysis suggests that a wide 
range of scenarios and pathways could allow 
us to meet our goals, there are two common 
themes that emerge:

Demand for energy needs to reduce 
dramatically through 2030 to 2050 –  
in some projections by over 40% from 
2005 levels.

Despite this, we can expect to see 
demand for electricity to at least stay the 
same and probably increase. (for example, 
as more electricity is used in the heating 
and transport sectors). In some scenarios, 
demand could increase by as much as  
50% – to deliver this and meet our 
emissions targets the power sector  
must comprehensively switch to low 
carbon sources.

Reducing energy 
demand
Reducing our demand for energy from the 
energy system is fundamental to the 
Government’s strategy, particularly because 
in many cases doing so saves money for 
households and businesses, whilst maintaining 
or improving our standards of living. Using 
technologies like smart meters and a more 
flexible grid will enable us to match new 
sources of low carbon energy with demand 
more efficiently. If we reduce demand for 
energy, it will be cheaper and more practical 
to decarbonise the energy system.

Demand for energy can be reduced by:

Increasing the efficiency with which we 
use energy (for example, through insulating 
our homes or commercial buildings).




 Chapter 8: 171
 Developing a roadmap to 2050

Reducing our demand for energy-intensive 
services (for example, through turning 
down our thermostats, when practical).

Making better use of our primary  
energy sources (for example, by using  
the recycled heat from power stations).

Using other forms of primary energy (for 
example, heat from the ground and the 
sun to warm our buildings).

A dramatic reduction in demand will require 
considerable effort in all parts of society – 
the homes we live in, our workplaces, the 
appliances we use and the way we travel 
may need to be significantly different. This 
will need to happen in a world where we 
expect our population and economy to have 
grown, where many of us will have the ability 
to purchase more goods, travel more and live 
in bigger and better homes. 

Some of the technology needed to improve 
energy efficiency already exists, and it is 
likely to improve further. The policies on 
energy efficiency set out in previous chapters 
will set us on the right pathway to 2020, but 
as they are implemented the Government, 
businesses and consumers will need to 
continue to look for further opportunities to 
reduce demand.

Therefore, there needs to be society-wide 
discussion about the practical implications 
of such demand reductions, including both 
the physical changes to improve energy 
efficiency and the changes in attitude to 
energy use that might be involved. The 
challenge of doing so needs to be evaluated 
against the practicality and cost of developing 
additional low carbon energy, to decide the 
appropriate balance of effort.

An increase in demand 
for electricity
Even as we reduce our demand for energy, 
we are likely to have an increased need for 
electricity. This is because many (but not all) 
scenarios suggest that in the future, more of 
the energy for heating and travel could come 
from electricity. 

Power stations in general have long  
life spans (for example, a coal plant can 
continue to be used for well over 30 years, 
and a future nuclear power plant could stay 
online for up to 60 years or more). Therefore, 
given the need to replace significant amounts 
of generating capacity in the next decade 
(see chapter 3), investment decisions being 
made now will shape our generating mix out 
to 2050 and beyond. 

We therefore need to plan for this today and 
as we do so, we need to consider both the 
generation mix and the generating capacity 
that may be required. 

The supply of electricity will need to be 
almost entirely decarbonised. In order to do 
this it is likely that our electricity will need to 
come in the main from a mix of renewable 
sources, nuclear power and coal and gas with 
carbon capture and storage. If demand for 
electricity does increase, the corresponding 
required increase in generating capacity will 
depend on the success with which these 
sources of low carbon electricity supply

172 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

(some of which are intermittent) can be 
matched with evolving demand. 

Our current installed electricity generating 
capacity is about 80 GW (about 75% of 
which comes from fossil fuels – see chapter 
3). If, for example, we electrify much of 
our transport and heating, our demand for 
electricity in 2050 could be 50% higher than 
it is today, making it possible that electricity 
could account for half of our overall energy 
use (see chart 1). As well as nuclear power, 
renewable energy such as wind, and coal 
and gas generation with carbon capture and 
storage, the final generating mix could also 
include contributions from other low carbon 
sources. These include wave, tidal, solar  

and geothermal power, distributed and micro-
generation and combined heat and power 
stations (potentially burning sustainable 
biomass), as well as technologies that are  
not yet developed.

If it is not possible or desirable to match low 
carbon electricity supply to such prospective 
increases in demand, then we would need 
to either reduce our energy demand further, 
or make greater use of alternative sources 
of energy. Bioenergy is a possible alternative 
in many sectors, if it is possible to address 
concerns about sustainability, particularly 
regarding biofuels – issues which are 
explored more fully in the next sections.

 Developing a roadmap to 2050

Managing areas  
of uncertainty
There is inevitably uncertainty about how the 
energy mix will evolve to 2050. Therefore, 
in designing a future energy roadmap, the 
Government will manage this uncertainty by 
ensuring that we build a framework robust to 
change, combining flexibility with appropriate 
regulatory and market stability. 

To illustrate this, four key areas of uncertainty 
that need to be addressed on the path to 
2050 are set out below. 

The balance between reducing 
demand and expanding low 
carbon supply of energy 

In the longer term, we will need to establish 
the best balance between efforts to reduce 
energy demand and the challenges and costs 
associated with increasing our supply of low 
carbon energy. 

Reducing overall energy demand can 
potentially be very cost-effective. However, 
there are real and practical constraints to 
what may be achievable on the ground.  
These include:

The scale of change we are all prepared to 
see in the way our homes look and  
are built.

The physical constraints and engineering 
challenges in moving to new technologies, 
such as installing large numbers of ground- 
and air-source heat pumps, or setting up 
district heating systems.

The commercial and lifestyle changes 
businesses and people are willing to make.

On the other hand, increasing the supply of 
low carbon energy has its own challenges, 
as discussed in the next sections.Therefore, 

through further work we will need to 
look closely at the feasibility, cost and 
acceptability of further reducing demand and 
increasing low carbon supply and understand 
the choices involved in balancing these. 

Establishing the role of 
bioenergy in providing low 
carbon energy

Many scenarios show an increase in the 
use of electricity to help with cost-effective 
decarbonisation. However, in some cases this 
is offset by increasing use of bioenergy in the 
heat and transport sectors (see box 2). 

Using sources of bioenergy could help 
solve some of the difficulties of using more 
electricity as it could provide an alternative 
renewable source of energy to decarbonise 
the heat and transport sectors. As an 
example, injecting sustainable biogas into 
the gas grid could provide an alternative to 
some electrical heating systems (or could 
supplement them on very cold days to 
reduce the peak in electricity demand). In The 
Potential for Renewable Gas in the UK (2009) 
a preliminary estimate from National Grid 
suggests that this could supply almost 20% 
of the UK’s household gas needs by 2020.

In practice, we are likely to use bioenergy 
alongside low carbon electricity as part 
of our energy mix. However, there are 
constraints that need to be considered. For 
example, there have been concerns about 
the sustainability of some current bioenergy 
technologies, such as first generation 
biofuels, and debate over the greenhouse 
gas savings they can achieve. Some 
doubt that globally we could source the 
required quantities of biomass and biofuels 
sustainably to provide energy on a very large 
scale, particularly if international demand 
increases beyond current projections. 




174 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

2.  For example, see E4tech’s Biomass supply curves for the UK (2009)

However other analysis suggests there will 
be enough sustainable biomass available 
globally to meet our projections for bioenergy 
until at least 2020.2 

If the UK met 20% of its future energy needs 
(for heat, electricity and transport) from 
bioenergy we would need to import much 
of this from sources abroad; we would not 
be able to grow this amount in the UK. The 
cost and feasibility of this would depend 
on international supply of and demand for 
these materials, including competition for 
alternative sources of renewable materials 
for construction, plastics and industrial 
chemicals and the need to maintain global 
food supplies. 

Relying on bioenergy to deliver more than 
set out in the Government’s UK Renewable 
Energy Strategy (2009) would require us to 
maximise the use of technologies such as 
combined heat and power and to develop 
advanced technologies for biofuels (including 
novel sources such as algae). Technologies 

such as anaerobic digestion and gasification 
would need to become commonplace. It 
might also be necessary to focus bioenergy 
use in areas where decarbonisation by other 
means will be difficult, such as aviation. The 
Government needs to continue to support 
the development of these options to ensure 
that, if viable, they are brought forward (see 
the Government’s Low Carbon Transport: 
A Greener Future (2009) and The UK 
Renewable Energy Strategy (2009)). Crucially, 
for bioenergy use to reach its full potential 
we must ensure that clear and effective 
international standards on sustainability  
are put in place. 

Technology paths 

The mix of low carbon technologies and 
energy sources used in 2050 is also unclear, 
particularly in heat and transport. In time it is 
possible that different forms of transport will 
use different energy sources: for example, 
aviation and heavy goods vehicles may run 
on biofuels or still rely on fossil fuels, while 
lighter vehicles may use mostly electricity or 
hydrogen. The eventual mix has considerable 
implications for the UK’s infrastructure, as 
well as other sectors such as electricity 
generating capacity. 

Similarly, our homes and buildings could 
plausibly be heated, or cooled, using a 
variety of low carbon technologies: heat 
pumps, boilers burning sustainable biomass 
or biogas, or perhaps using the captured 
waste heat from electricity generation. How 
this energy mix evolves will have significant 
impacts on the other elements of the  
energy system.

It is also impossible to predict the precise 
mix of electricity generating technologies 
we will use in 2050. The roadmap to 2050 
needs to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to 
technological developments in any sector.

 Developing a roadmap to 2050

Box 2
What might be the role of energy from recent biological sources in a low 
carbon energy system?

Bioenergy comes from a wide range 
of renewable sources including wood, 
energy crops and organic wastes such 
as sewage and waste. It is also used  
in a number of forms.

There are many ways of using  

bio-energy: 

Electricity generation: We can use 
dedicated biomass power stations,  
or can co-fire coal with biomass 
in power stations (and potentially 
with carbon capture and storage 
technology as well). This provides 
flexible generating capacity to balance 
intermittent sources like wind, which 
helps to reduce overall emissions.  
When used in combined heat and  
power plants, the waste heat is  
captured and used to heat local 
businesses and homes. 

Heating: The simplest use of biomass 
is through direct burning in biomass 
boilers, which can be used to heat our 
homes or our water. We can also use 
biogas or synthesis gas to produce heat. 

Transport: Our cars can already run on 
a blend of biofuel and conventional 
fossil fuel. Currently, two primary 
biofuels are in commercial production: 
bioethanol and biodiesel. In the near 
future, biomass-to-liquid technologies 
are likely to be used to produce biofuels.

Only sustainably produced biomass 
should be used. The Government 
needs to work to ensure that effective 
mechanisms are in place that 
address potential negative impacts 
on biodiversity, land use, food prices 
or other sustainability concerns - 
domestically or internationally.

Sources of residual emissions

Finally, there remains uncertainty about 
the scale at which we will still need to use 
energy sources that create emissions. Any 
use will have to be consistent with the UK’s 
overall targets, emissions reductions in other 
sectors and the extent to which we can trade 
emissions in 2050. Examples of energy-
related emissions that might be hard to 
eliminate can be found in transport (perhaps 
from aviation or heavy vehicles, or in cars 
for longer journeys), heating (perhaps from 
burning gas on very cold days) and power 
(from residual emissions from carbon capture 
and storage, or perhaps from combined heat 

and power units, or gas-fired power plants 
supplying peak demand). This is another area 
of uncertainty that our long-term planning will 
need to accommodate.

 Developing a roadmap to 2050

The transition to low carbon transport could require 
substantial additional infrastructure, such as 
charging points for electric cars

Practical challenges
Changing our energy system will take place 
over decades, and will be driven by an 
appropriate market and regulatory framework 
to encourage private sector investment, 
based on a carbon price. However, there are 
a number of practical considerations that 
the Government and industry need to keep 
under review to ensure that there is sufficient 
strategic direction to keep us on a path that 
will meet our long-term emission targets:

Planning and enabling timely investment:

Delivering sufficient financial investment, 
and ensuring the attractiveness of the 
UK as a place to invest.

Ensuring planning policies support the 
development and installation of low 
carbon technologies.

Taking advantage of the replacement/
refurbishment schedules of existing 
plants and infrastructure.

Delivering the engineering challenges of 
building a low carbon energy system of 
this scale:

Meeting the physical and supply chain 
challenges of building new, reliable 
electrical generating capacity and 
other energy infrastructure at this 
scale, particularly in the face of likely 
international competition for these 
capabilities.

Developing or upgrading infrastructure 
as it becomes necessary. As well as 
the electricity grid (transmission and 
distribution networks), this could include 
networks for transporting and storing 
captured carbon, systems for managing 
nuclear waste, hydrogen or electric 
vehicle fuelling/charging networks and 
community heat systems.

Matching evolving sources of demand 
for energy with new sources of supply in  
an efficient and practical manner. 

Building the necessary skills base.

Developing technologies that we  
are relying on or that we may need  
to plan for.

Dealing with broader societal impacts:

Consumer and business acceptance of 
new ways of travelling, heating buildings 
and using appliances.

Impacts on the local environment of 
different technology paths.

The impact on the least well off of 
moving to a low carbon society.




178 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Securing change  
in the long term
This Transition Plan sets out a clear plan  
that put us on the right path to 2020 and 
beyond. Given the scale of the longer term 
changes required and the time it takes to 
achieve them, the Government, industry  
and stakeholders need to examine how  
to continue to drive cost-effective progress 
towards 2050, whilst maintaining secure 
energy supplies, maximising economic 
opportunities and protecting the  
most vulnerable. 

Therefore the Government will develop a 
strategic roadmap to 2050 by spring 2010, 
working closely with industry and wider 
stakeholders. The roadmap will help to 
build consensus between the Government, 
industry and the public on the scale and 
nature of the changes we need to see 
and the issues that need to be addressed, 
enabling major infrastructure and capacity - 
building investments to be made.

In autumn, the Committee on Climate 
Change will provide further analysis of 
the pathway through 2030 to 2050. The 
Government will work with the Committee, 
taking its analysis and recommendations  
into account when developing the roadmap  
to 2050.

Summary

Action on energy and climate change is 
taking place across the whole of the UK. In 
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales the 
devolved administrations are responsible for 
some areas of energy and climate change 
policy, with differences in responsibility 
between each administration. This part of 
the plan sets out the ambitions and actions 
that the devolved administrations in Northern 
Ireland, Scotland and Wales are taking and 
how this is contributing to developments 
across the whole of the UK.

Each devolved administration has set out 
key targets and ambitions that reflect its 
responsibilities and circumstances: 

Ireland: Through its Programme for 
Government 2008-2011, the Northern 
Ireland Executive has committed to reduce 
emissions by 25% on 1990 levels by 
2025. The Executive and Northern Ireland 
Assembly have also consented to the 
extension of the Climate Change Act 2008 
to Northern Ireland and are contributing to 
UK carbon budgets and targets.

Scotland: The Climate Change (Scotland) 
Bill as passed sets a mandatory target to 
achieve an 80% reduction in 1990 levels 
of Scottish greenhouse gas emissions by 
2050 and creates a statutory framework 
committing the Scottish Government 
to securing this reduction. The Scottish 
Government is committed to delivering the 
highest possible interim 2020 target based 
on expert advice from the Committee on 
Climate Change, and the Bill as passed 
sets the 2020 target to 42%.

Wales: The Welsh Assembly Government 
in One Wales - A progressive agenda 
for the government of Wales, made a 
commitment for Wales to reduce annual 
greenhouse gas emissions by 3% each 
year in areas of devolved competence 
by 2011 and to set out specific sectoral 
targets in relation to residential, public 
and transport areas. Through the Climate 
Change commission for Wales, the 
Assembly Government is exploring the 
implications of more ambitious emission 
reduction scenarios of 3%, 6% and 9%. 
The Assembly Government also wishes 
to see Wales by 2025 producing more 
electricity each year from renewables, 
especially from marine resources, than the 
electricity consumed annually by  
the nation.

Action to tackle climate change is happening 
across the UK




 Chapter 9: 181
 Further action in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales 

Some matters which relate to climate  
change and energy policy in Northern  
Ireland, Scotland and Wales are the 
responsibility of the devolved administrations, 
and therefore decisions on these matters 
are made in the light of each administration’s 
particular circumstances. 

Which areas are devolved and which 
are not vary in each case, but in general 
terms each devolved administration has 
programmes on low carbon economic 
development, fuel poverty, energy efficiency, 
and environmental, agricultural and rural 
policy. Energy is particularly complicated; for 
example, Northern Ireland’s energy system is 
closely linked to the Republic of Ireland’s. This 
chapter sets out the approach being taken 
by each of the devolved administrations in 
relevant policy areas outlining just some of 
the range of activity being undertaken in  
each sector of the economy.

Northern Ireland

Through its Programme for Government 
2008-2011, the Northern Ireland Executive 
has committed to reduce emissions by 
25% on 1990 levels by 2025. The Executive 
and Northern Ireland Assembly have also 
consented to the extension of the Climate 
Change Act 2008 to Northern Ireland and 
are contributing to UK carbon budgets and 
targets. Northern Ireland is also participating 
in a number of relevant EU and UK energy 
and climate change policies. Through the 
Climate Change Act 2008, Northern Ireland 
is committed to the development of a UK 
risk assessment on the impacts of climate 
change and this will inform the development 
of a Northern Ireland adaptation programme. 

Scotland

Through its Government Economic Strategy 
the Scottish Government has committed 
to reducing Scottish emissions. The 
Climate Change (Scotland) Bill as passed 
sets a mandatory target to achieve an 
80% reduction on 1990 levels of Scottish 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and 
creates a statutory framework committing 
the Scottish Government to securing this 
reduction. The Scottish Government is 
committed to delivering the highest possible 
interim 2020 target based on expert advice 
from the Committee on Climate Change. The 
interim target provision in the Bill as passed 
sets the 2020 target to 42%, requiring 
Scottish Ministers to seek expert advice at 
the earliest opportunity on what the highest 
achievable 2020 target should be. The Bill 
provides order making powers to revise the 
2020 target to match the expert advice – this 
means the target could go up or down. 

The Bill as passed commits the Scottish 
Government to publishing and reporting on 
an Energy Efficiency Action Plan covering 
all sectors. The draft Action Plan will be 
published for consultation later in the 
summer of 2009. The Bill as passed also 
includes a number of provisions to support 
waste reduction and recycling, in line with 
Zero Waste principles and improvements 
to the energy performance of the existing 
building stock. The Climate Change Delivery 
Plan: Meeting Scotland’s Statutory Climate 
Change Targets, setting out strategic options 
for delivering future emissions cuts in 
Scotland was published in June 2009. The 
Scottish Government is also committed to 
assessing the impact on carbon emissions of 
its own spending and is developing a Climate 
Change Adaptation Framework to make sure 
Scotland can adapt to the impacts of climate 
change which are already being felt. 




182 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Wales

The Welsh Assembly Government in  
One Wales - A progressive agenda for the 
government of Wales, made a commitment 
for Wales to reduce annual greenhouse 
gas emissions by 3% in areas of devolved 
competence by 2011 and to set out specific 
sectoral targets in relation to residential, 
public and transport areas. The focus is on 
action in Wales, which will be led by the 
Assembly Government, but with a strong 
emphasis on all sectors playing a role in 
reducing emissions and adapting to the 
impacts of climate change. 

Achieving the 3% annual reduction will be 
Wales’ contribution to the UK carbon budgets 
and targets. The Assembly Government’s 
policies and programmes will be set out 
in a Climate Change Strategy for Wales, 
which is being developed in two stages. 
The first stage – Climate Change Strategy 
– High Level Policy Statement consultation, 
published at the beginning of the year, sets 
out the definitions of the targets and the 
broad areas where Wales will focus action to 
tackle both the causes and consequences of 
climate change. The second stage, Climate 
Change Strategy for Wales – Programme 
of Action was published in June 2009. This 
sets out how the Assembly Government is 
going to meet its One Wales target, detailing 
the action to be taken to reduce emissions 

and adapt to the impacts of climate change. 
The final Climate Change Strategy for 
Wales, bringing together the results of 
the two consultations, will be published 
at the end of the year and be informed 
by the Commission’s scenario work. The 
Assembly Government will also publish a 
comprehensive Energy Strategy, bringing 
together the Wales Energy Route Map, 
National Energy Efficiency and Saving Plan, 
Marine Energy Statement and Bio-Energy 
Action Plan.

Transforming  
our power sector
Northern Ireland

In Northern Ireland, the proportion of 
electricity consumption generated from 
renewable energy sources has doubled 
since the introduction of the Northern Ireland 
Renewables Obligation in 2005. Currently, 
indigenous renewables generation represents 
7% of total electricity consumption and is 
on course to meet the 12% target set for 
2012 – mainly from onshore wind power. 
The Department of Enterprise, Trade and 
Investment (DETI), which has responsibility 
for energy matters in Northern Ireland, has

 Chapter 9: 183
 Further action in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales 

recently published a draft Strategic Energy 
Framework for public consultation. This has 
a focus on renewables and proposes a new 
target for 2020 that will contribute to the 
overall UK renewable energy target of 15%. 

DETI is working with other departments and 
agencies to develop non-wind renewables in 
order to diversify the renewable energy mix. 
As part of this, the Department is developing 
a Strategic Action Plan for offshore wind 
and marine renewables (tidal stream and 
wave). This plan is currently the subject 
of a Strategic Environmental Assessment 
(SEA) and will be issued for consultation 
in Autumn 2009 alongside the SEA’s 
environmental report. It is also proposed to 
consult in Summer 2009 on the first Cross 
Departmental Bioenergy Action Plan. 

Increasing levels of renewable energy 
generation will also require significant 
investment in the electricity grid in Northern 
Ireland. A programme of grid strengthening  
is being developed. 

Scotland

Scottish Ministers are committed to 
promoting energy from a wide range of 
renewable sources, and have a target that 
50% of electricity generated in Scotland, 
as a proportion of demand, should come 
from renewable sources by 2020, with an 
interim milestone of 31% by 2011. Much 
of the developer activity to date, driven by 
the Renewables Obligation Scotland, has 
been focused on onshore wind. In common 
with the rest of the UK, the introduction of 
banding to give different levels of support 
through the Renewables Obligation Scotland 
for different renewable energy technologies 
is expected to bring on a wider range of 
technologies. The Scottish Government 
continues to provide additional support to 
small- and micro-scale renewables through 
its Communities And Renewable Energy 
Scheme and Energy Saving Scotland –  
Home Renewables service. 

Wales

The Renewable Energy Route Map, 
published for consultation in February 2008, 
sets out Wales’ agenda for exploiting its 
exceptional renewable energy resources. 
Currently some 360MW of onshore wind 
energy is operational in Wales, with 60MW 
of off shore wind development at North 
Hoyle and a further 100MW of offshore wind 
development currently under construction. 
The second largest offshore windfarm in the 
world, 750MW at Gwynt y Mor, received 
consent in December 2008 and, in addition 
to the enormous industry efforts to deliver 
Wales, ambitious on-shore wind targets, 
more than 5000MW of further offshore wind 
is in prospect. In addition 150MW of hydro 
power is operational in Wales and in north 
Wales two major pumped storage stations 
continue to play an important role. There is 
also substantial co-firing of biomass in Wales, 
coal fired power stations and a number of 
significant biomass projects, including energy 
from waste, in prospect.

The Welsh Assembly Government is working 
with National Grid Transco on necessary 
electricity grid enhancements and is taking 
action to remove barriers to investment. 
Planning Policy Wales, published in March 
2002, sets out the Welsh Assembly 
Government’s planning policies and climate 
change is a pivotal factor. In 2006 the 

Scotland is making progress towards 50% of its 
electricity coming from renewable sources




184 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

1. The Electricity and Gas Billing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009.

Assembly Government consulted on a range 
of proposed changes to further increase 
the emphasis on tackling climate change 
in national planning policy. These policies 
have been further updated since the One 
Wales 3% target was adopted in 2007. To 
implement policies and technical advice, 
the Assembly Government has also funded 
a series of training seminars on planning 
for climate change. Against the background 
of the joint Assembly Government / UK 
Government / South West England Severn 
tidal power feasibility study, Wales’ renewable 
energy route map and the associated Welsh 
Assembly Government bio-energy action plan 
and Ministerial marine energy statement of 
intent, investments in renewable electricity 
production of up to £40 billion are in 
prospect.

Similarly, as well as encouraging community 
renewable electricity developments, the 
Welsh Assembly Government will be 
seeking to ensure that significant amounts of 
renewable heat are produced in Wales both 
from the use of biomass from sustainable 
sources and from community scale 
renewables and micro-generation systems.

Transforming 
our homes and 
communities
Northern Ireland

In Northern Ireland, all new build social 
housing is required to meet Level 3 of  
the Code for Sustainable Homes, and 
housing associations are offered incentives 
to exceed these standards. There is currently 
a target for all social housing in Northern 
Ireland to meet the Decent Homes standard 
by 2013. Existing housing across tenures 

Action is taking place across the UK to cut emissions 
from our homes

has become substantially more efficient and 
is improving, thanks to schemes such as 
Warm Homes, Cosy Homes and the Heating 
Replacement Scheme.

Under the Energy End Use Efficiency and 
Energy Services Directive, Northern Ireland 
has implemented, as part of the UK Energy 
Efficiency Action Plan, a 1% year on year 
energy savings target. A Northern Ireland 
Energy Efficiency Action Plan is currently 
being developed and should complete 
towards the end of 2009. This Action Plan 
will identify energy efficiency measures 
and opportunities that can be implemented 
during the next two years. The Department 
of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) 
has now signed voluntary agreements 
with all of the major energy suppliers in 
Northern Ireland (electricity, gas, oil, coal and 
biomass) to provide energy efficiency advice 
and information, collection of energy data, 
monitoring of targets, and provision of  
energy audits.

 The DETI has now completed a consultation 
on better energy billing and metering. As a 
result, new regulations1 have been introduced 
to ensure electricity and gas suppliers provide 
a year’s historical consumption data to all 
domestic customers. The DETI continues 
to work to improve public engagement on

 Further action in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales 

sustainable energy issues, and will produce a 
sustainable energy marketing plan by the end 
of 2009. 

Scotland

The Scottish Government has supported 
energy efficiency improvements to be made 
in homes and wider communities. 

The Energy Saving Scotland advice network 
provides a one-stop-shop offering support on 
a range of sustainable living issues, including 
energy efficiency, microgeneration, transport 
and waste. The network is managed by the 
Energy Saving Trust. The Scottish Government 
is introducing an area-based Home Insulation 
Scheme, to increase the take up of energy 
advice and insulation measures in selected 
areas, to reduce emissions, tackle fuel 
poverty, reduce household bills and sustain 
jobs. This is supported by £15 million of 
investment in 2009-10, with matching 
investment being sought from other sources. 

Scotland has also implemented the  
European Directive on the Energy 
Performance of Buildings (EPBD), with 
energy performance certificates required  
for both domestic and non-domestic 
buildings that are newly built, offered for sale 
or rental, and for public buildings. Scotland 
also requires inspections of larger air-
conditioning systems under the EPBD.

Scottish building regulations are devolved. 
In 2007, an expert panel advised on staged 
improvements to standards in 2010 and 2013, 
with the goal of net zero carbon buildings by 
2016-17, if practical. Energy standards are the 
most demanding in the UK and a consultation 
on measures to reduce emissions by a 
further 30%, with effect from October 2010, 
is in progress.

Scotland introduced a more holistic approach 
to tackling fuel poverty with the new Energy 
Assistance Package introduced in April 2009. 
This builds on the success of the Scottish 

Government’s previous Central Heating and 
Warm Deal programmes, but provides more 
help for a wider range of households. Clients 
are offered benefit and tax credit checks, 
tariff checks, energy efficiency advice,  
access to cavity and loft insulation measures 
through CERT providers and, for those 
households most vulnerable to fuel poverty, 
access to grants for enhanced insulation and 
heating improvements. 

Wales

Supporting people and communities to 
reduce their carbon footprint of their homes 
is one of the key themes of the Welsh 
Assembly Government’s emerging Climate 
Change Strategy. Consequently, the Welsh 
Assembly Government has set out its 
aspiration that all new buildings in Wales 
be zero carbon from 2011. It also requires 
all new housing that it influences through 
grant funding, investment and land disposals 
to meet at least Level 3 of the Code for 
Sustainable Homes, moving as quickly as 
possible to Level 4. For social housing, a 
minimum energy efficiency rating must be 
achieved by all existing social housing within 
Wales, by 2012. 

The National Housing Strategy sets out the 
Welsh Assembly Government’s long-term 
vision for housing. This and the National 
Energy Efficiency and Savings Plan aims to 
reduce Wales’ greenhouse gas emissions, 
reduce fuel poverty and support economic 
development. It proposes actions to 
help all householders, and seeks to help 
communities work together. 

The Welsh Assembly Government’s Home 
Energy Efficiency Scheme has helped to 
reduce household emissions. More than 
100,000 householders have been helped to 
save money since 2000. The Welsh Assembly 
Government has consulted on targeting 
funding at the most inefficient properties 
and those people most in need of support. 




186 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

It is also running a major climate change 
campaign, encouraging people to measure 
and reduce their emissions.

Climate change is fully integrated into the 
Welsh Assembly Government’s national 
planning policies, and Planning Policy Wales 
has been updated to increase the emphasis 
on tackling climate change.

Looking ahead, the Assembly Government 
is proposing to develop an area-based 
approach to domestic energy efficiency 
improvements. The approach will include 
projects to tackle fuel poverty using new 
technology, stimulating the supply chain and 
creating job opportunities including through 
the Heads of the Valley Low Carbon Zone. 
It will support community scale energy 
generation projects, and make funding 
available for farm renewable energy projects. 
The Welsh Assembly Government will work 
with the Energy Saving Trust and Carbon Trust 
to provide more advice and support, and will 
promote the use of waste heat and improved 
energy efficiency in businesses.

Incentivising and supporting 

businesses to reduce emissions

Invest NI, which provides Government 
support to encourage investment in Northern 
Ireland and help new businesses grow 
and compete internationally, runs resource 
efficiency activities. These are aimed 
primarily at increasing the productivity and 
competitiveness of businesses through more 
efficient use of materials, water and energy. 
They comprise funding of the local delivery 
of nationwide programmes, the Carbon Trust, 

loan schemes to help fund the deployment of 
sustainable energy equipment and practices, 
Envirowise and the National Industrial 
Symbiosis Programme. 

Leading the way in the public sector

Northern Ireland’s Public Sector Energy 
Campaign sets carbon reduction, energy 
efficiency and electricity consumption targets 
for public sector estate buildings in Northern 
Ireland, which are measured annually in 
published reports. 

To support delivery of these targets, the 
Department of Finance and Personnel 
currently makes available £2 million annually 
in grant assistance via the Central Energy 
Efficiency Fund. Successful projects may 
receive a grant that will cover up to 100%  
of the capital cost of the project.

Supporting UK businesses to

 Chapter 9: 187
 Further action in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales 

to take advantage of the opportunities  
offered by a low carbon economy is currently 
being developed. 

The strategy aims to position Northern Ireland 
as a leading region in renewable energy 
development, securing greater business for 
clients in renewable energy supply chains. 
Initiatives aligned to the strategy include 
awareness raising and publicising of business 
opportunities; encouraging and facilitating 
business clustering and networking; 
promotion of the region as an FDI candidate 
for companies in renewables; identification 
and promotion of regional strengths in low 
carbon technologies; participation in the UK 
Government’s Renewables Deployment 
Forum; support of renewables trade missions 
overseas; and encouraging businesses and 
the local universities to establish centres  
of competence in renewables.

Scotland

Incentivising and supporting 

businesses to reduce emissions

Business and industry in Scotland is playing a 
key role in tackling climate change, with many 
enterprises taking steps to improve their 
energy efficiency and cut waste, as well as 
seizing the business opportunities presented 
by the low carbon economy. 

The Scottish Government is supporting 
the work of the Climate Change Business 
Delivery Group, which shares ideas, 
challenges Scottish business to do more to 
tackle climate change, acts as a source of 
inspiration and information for others in the 
Scottish business community, and influences 
policy and practice.

To promote awareness, the Scottish 
Government is funding Scottish Business 
in the Community (2008-2010) to support 
the May Day Network which encourages 
businesses to make climate change pledges 
and take energy efficiency measures. 

A further £2 million has been invested in 
the loan scheme for small and medium 
sized enterprises to improve their energy 
efficiency, specifically for microgeneration 
support. This takes the total amount invested 
in this scheme to £5 million. 

Microgeneration equipment has been 
exempted from rating valuation for the 
purposes of non-domestic rates. The 
measure removes a potential disincentive 
for businesses to invest in microgeneration 
equipment – with a capacity of up to 50kW  
or 45kW thermal.

The Scottish Government funds the Carbon 
Trust to provide technical energy efficiency 
advice and change management support 
to large and energy-intensive businesses. 
This may include on-site energy audits or 
a more bespoke service to suit the needs 
of the business. This support has resulted 
in significant carbon and cost savings for 
industry. The Scottish Government also funds 
the Envirowise programme, to provide advice 
to business on resource efficiency, waste 
prevention and the sustainable use of water.

Leading the way in the public sector

In Scotland, all local authorities have signed 
Scotland’s Climate Change Declaration and 
committed themselves to take action, in 
partnership with the Scottish Government. 
The Carbon Trust’s Public Sector Carbon 
Management Programme has proved very 
successful in Scotland. The impact of the 
Carbon Management Programme continues 
to grow year-on-year with the latest group of 
plans estimated to save over 150,000 tonnes 
of CO


2

 over the next five years.

The Scottish Government continues to 
support the public sector through the Central 
Energy Efficiency Fund, which has seen £20 
million provided to Scottish Local Authorities, 
the NHS Scotland and Scottish Water. 
Through interest free loans, these bodies 
use the scheme for capital investment in 




188 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan

energy efficiency projects and, as of 2009, 
also for renewables technologies. In 2008 the 
Scottish Government also awarded a further 
£4 million, managed through Salix Finance, 
for the further and higher education sector  
in Scotland.

Public sector spending on goods and services 
across Scotland amounts to approximately 
£8 billion per year. The Scottish Government 
issued guidance to the public sector in 
October 2008 recommending the use of the 
Buy Sustainable - Quick Wins which are a 
range of detailed specifications for commonly 
purchased goods that can be adopted to 
deliver sustainable outcomes.

Supporting businesses to make the 

most of new economic opportunities

Major investment plans in the Scottish 
renewable sector, remain on track. Onshore 
wind in Scotland also remains resilient, 
illustrated by the announcement from 
ScottishPower Renewables that construction 
of Europe’s largest onshore wind farm at 
Whitelee, near Glasgow, has now been 
completed ahead of schedule.

Wave and tidal energy still remains an area of 
huge potential growth. With full applications 
for the first round of the Crown Estate’s 
leasing programme focused on the Pentland 
Firth due to be submitted in mid May. This 
development area includes the site of the 
first test centre for wave and tidal technology 
in the world, the European Marine Energy 
Centre (EMEC) in Orkney. The potential to 
unlock the resources in the Pentland Firth, 
which is estimated to contain six of the top 
ten sites for tidal developments in the UK, 
will promote both leadership in this industry 
along with valuable new jobs in Scotland.

The Crown Estate has identified 10 potential 
sites for offshore development within 
Scottish Territorial Waters with the potential 
to generate 6.4GW of renewable electricity. 

Wales

Incentivising and supporting 

businesses to reduce emissions

Supporting businesses and the public sector 
in Wales to reduce their carbon footprint is 
a key theme of the Assembly Government’s 
Climate Change Strategy. As part of its Green 
Jobs Strategy the Assembly Government is 
investing in a new component of its Flexible 
Support for Businesses to respond to the 
challenge of climate change. Flexible Support 
for Business Environment and Sustainability 
will enable businesses to access the best 
possible knowledge on sustainable and cost 
effective business practices and contribute 
towards Wales achieving a low carbon 
economy. In addition, the Welsh Assembly 
Government will be providing enhanced 
support and advice to small and medium 
sized enterprises through the Carbon Trust.

The Assembly Government recognises 
that the public sector has a critical role to 
play in visibly demonstrating leadership 
on climate change action and this is a key 

New technologies such as offshore wind are

theme in the emerging Climate Change 
Strategy. The focus of action will be to 
reduce the carbon footprint of public sector 
organisations across Wales, supported by 
a comprehensive programme to educate 
and raise awareness of climate change 
across the sector and by providing the 
skills needed by a green workforce.

Supporting UK businesses to 

make the most of new economic 

opportunities

The Welsh Assembly Government published 
its final Green Jobs Strategy in July 2009. 
It forms part of a much broader range of 
measures designed to create a sustainable 
economy built on the firm foundations 
of sustainable businesses, sustainable 
technologies and sustainable employment. 
The strategy is organised around three 
priorities: supporting business, fostering 
innovation and technology, and investing  
for a more sustainable economy.

The Green Jobs Strategy will play a key 
part in shaping and driving the business 
opportunities associated with a move to a 
low carbon, low waste economy, including 
seizing on the local supply chain opportunities 
which will be created by the billions of low 
carbon electricity investments in Wales which 
these climate change and energy policies will 
be encouraging.

These developments will make an important 
contribution to the way in which Wales 
deals with the current economic situation 
and places itself in a robust position to take 
advantage of future opportunities. 

Transforming 
transport
Northern Ireland

Road transport is the largest source of  
greenhouse gas emissions in the North 
of Ireland, accounting for 29% of total 
carbon emissions. Delivering reductions 
in greenhouse gas emissions from road 
transport, while ensuring the provision of 
transport arrangements that meet economic 
and social needs, presents a significant 
challenge. Reconciling these potentially 
competing priorities is a key objective. 

The Northern Ireland Executive and 
Assembly recognise the real need to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions across 
the transport sector to meet the challenge 
of climate change. The Programme for 
Government, in line with the Sustainable 
Development Strategy, has set an ambitious 
target for a reduction in local emissions of 
greenhouse gases. To contribute fully to 
realisation of the target, a 51% reduction  
is required on 2006 greenhouse gas 
emissions from road transport by 2025. 

The immediate priority is to establish the 
baseline greenhouse gas emissions from 
transport and the options for reduction.  
The Regional Transportation Strategy is 
currently being reviewed to enhance the suite 
of policy and operational measures needed 
to ensure that future transport arrangements 
are more sustainable.

The Executive and Assembly’s current 
investment plans – set out in the Investment 
Strategy for 2008-2018 – envisage a 
significant level of investment in public 
transport, including the Belfast Rapid Transit 
project. Planned investment in buses, 




190 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

trains and related facilities aims to promote 
increased utilisation of public transport 
and reduce dependency on the private 
car, thereby contributing to climate change 
targets. To facilitate progress in this area, 
action will continue to promote behavioural 
change and more sustainable modes  
of travel.

Scotland

The Scottish Government’s Climate Change 
Delivery Plan: Meeting Scotland’s Statutory 
Climate Change Targets, shows that strong 
demand management measures will be 
needed up to 2020. Significant uptake of low 
carbon vehicles, coupled with smarter travel, 
should contribute towards a 50% reduction 
in land transport emissions by 2030. Further 
vehicle changes, coupled with the potential 
development of alternative fuels should make 
a 90% reduction in land transport emissions 
feasible by 2050.

Scotland’s National Transport Strategy 
commits to develop a carbon account for 
transport, to monitor progress, and show 
which transport policies are forecast to  
have the most impact.

The Scottish Government will consult in 
Summer 2009 on how to accelerate the 
development and uptake of low carbon 
vehicles, and possible targets to be set. Work 
is underway to benchmark the Scottish public 
sector fleet, and to identify potential for 
greener vehicle procurement.

Smarter Choices, Smarter Places is a 
partnership project which makes up to £15 
million available, over three years, for seven 
Local Authorities to improve public transport 
services, walking and cycling infrastructure, 
and roll out intensive marketing and 
awareness campaigns. 

The Scottish Government’s draft Cycling 
Action Plan for Scotland is being consulted on 
over Summer 2009 and proposes a target of 
10% of all journeys made by bike  
by 2020. The Scottish Government also 
makes funding available to organisations, 
including Local Authorities, to promote  
active travel initiatives.

The Scottish Government funds the Energy 
Saving Trust to engage individuals and 
organisations. The Trust and the Energy 
Saving Scotland Advice Network promote 
eco-driving. The Trust provides free, bespoke 
advice on fleets (Green Fleet Reviews) and 
Travel Plans. Additional support on Travel 
Plans and Smarter Choices initiatives are 
provided by Travel Plan officers in each 
Regional Transport Partnership. 

The Scottish Government is reviewing the 
bus subsidy, paid as Bus Service Operators 
Grant, to link it more closely to reduced 
environmental impact.

The Scottish Government is investing over 
£500,000 in 2008-11 in extending the Freight 
Best Practice Programme into Scotland as 
part of its support for the freight industry. 
As part of the UK-wide Sustainable Rail 
Programme, the Scottish Government is 
planning a rolling programme of electrification 
of Scotland’s railways and greater efficiency 
from the whole of the rail sector.

A major review of Scottish ferry provision is 
currently underway, to identify options for 
significant emission reduction measures. 
Alternative fuels and innovative vessel  
design measures are being considered as 
part of the review.

Emissions from domestic and international 
aviation are included in the Scottish 
Government’s Climate Change Bill.




 Chapter 9: 191
 Further action in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales 

Wales

Supporting emission reductions across 
the transport sector is a key theme of the 
Assembly Government’s emerging Climate 
Change Strategy. The Wales Transport 
Strategy was published in 2008 and the 
National Transport Plan was published in July 
2009. Regional Transport Plans are being 
developed and it is anticipated that the final 
regional transport plans will be in place by 
December 2009.

The Assembly Government and partners 
are working to encourage people to make 
choices that will help reduce their carbon 
footprint and a reduction in car usage. This 
includes enhanced provision for walking  
and cycling, as well as public transport,  
park and ride, high occupancy vehicle  
lanes and the promotion of eco-driving 
techniques. The Welsh Assembly 
Government has Action Plans and targets 
to support this and has announced plans 
for developing Sustainable Travel Towns in 
Wales. These will target a series of focused 
‘smarter choice’ interventions. The Assembly 
Government funds the Energy Saving Trust  
to provide consumer travel advice and advice 
to fleet operators.

The Welsh Assembly Government is also 
planning to establish a centre for inter-
modal freight logistics, which would create 
maximum efficiencies with the freight sector.

Northern Ireland

Work is underway to explore emission 
reduction options for agriculture in Northern 
Ireland. This will help develop a vision for 
local agriculture’s contribution to climate 
change targets by 2050. The Northern Ireland 
Executive is already taking action in a number 
of areas:

The Nitrates Directive Action Plan, control of 
stocking levels and fertiliser use under agri-
environment schemes, support for increased 
efficiency in manure spreading technologies, 
and demonstration and training programmes 
will all contribute to reduced agricultural 
emissions up to 2020. 

Increasing our forests helps our efforts to cut 
greenhouse gases

The Welsh Assembly Government is helping people 
to choose to reduce transport emissions




192 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

The Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development Forest Service’s Strategy for 
Sustainability and Growth aims to double tree 
cover from 6% to 12% of land area by 2056. 
This will improve opportunities for carbon 
sequestration, while ongoing support of short 
rotation willow coppice for renewable energy 
will also contribute to emissions reductions.

Scotland

The Scottish Government is funding a 
range of research to understand the role 
of land use in greenhouse gas emissions 
and their mitigation. This includes research 
on the impacts, costs and benefits of 
biomass energy crops, the role of forestry 
in relation to carbon ‘sinks’, changes in 
consumer demand in the move to a low 
carbon economy, and understanding policy 
instruments to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions.

In May 2008, the Graham Report was 
published by the Scottish Government. 
This was the output of a stakeholder group, 
chaired by Henry Graham, which looked at 
the main issues relating to agriculture and 
climate change in Scotland. In May 2009, 
Farming for a Better Climate, a five point 
action plan, was published which suggests 
ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
whilst strengthening farm businesses to 
make them more resilient to climate change. 
Further work is now underway to ensure 
that the agricultural sector plays its part in 
meeting the Scottish Government targets for 
reducing emissions as set out in the Climate 
Change (Scotland) Bill as passed.

The Scottish Government is publishing a 
new National Waste Management Plan for 
Scotland, outlining ambitious targets on 
waste prevention, re-use and recycling. 

The Scottish Forestry Strategy, published in 
2006 identifies climate change as a central 
theme. The strategy sets out how the 
Scottish Government will:

Increase awareness of how the forestry 
sector can help to tackle the threats of 
climate change.

Ensure that Scotland’s woodlands and the 
forestry sector meet their full potential in 
facilitating ecological, economic and social 
adaptation to climate change.

Capture opportunities for forestry to help 
mitigate climate change through the use of 
wood resources and habitat management.

Increase the amount of carbon locked up 
by Scottish forestry.

In addition, early in 2009 Forestry 
Commission Scotland published a climate 
change action plan (2009 –2011). It describes 
what the Commission will do to increase 
the contribution of Scottish forestry to the 
challenges of climate change and focuses on 
what needs to be done both as early actions 
and to increase future readiness. Key actions 
include creating new woodland to increase 
the potential for forests to absorb carbon 
dioxide, expanding the use of woodfuel as 
a form of renewable energy, and increasing 
the use of timber in place of more carbon 
intensive materials.

Scotland has the greatest capacity within 
British forests to absorb carbon dioxide from 
the atmosphere. This is due to the scale of 
forest cover in Scotland and the types of 
species that it includes. In 2006, forests in 
Scotland removed about 10.1 million tonnes 
of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
Considerable potential exists to extend 
this capacity in future. A sustained planting 
programme of 10-15,000 hectares of new 
woodland per year could result, by 2050, in a 
further 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per 
year being absorbed.




 Chapter 9: 193
 Further action in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales 

Wales

The report Sustainable Farming and 
Environment – Action towards 2020 
recommends that action is taken by the 
Welsh Assembly Government to achieve 
carbon neutral status for agriculture by 2020.

Through Farming Connect, the Assembly 
Government will promote nutrient and 
resource management planning and best 
practice advice. It will ensure that adherence 
to the Code for Good Agricultural Practice 
occurs. The Welsh Assembly Government 
will use Farming Connect farm development 
programmes to deliver technical efficiency 
methods for the dairy, beef, sheep, arable 
and horticulture sectors to deliver emission 
reductions. It will also encourage farmers to 
take stock of farm emissions through the use 
of an on-farm carbon-accounting tool which is 
part of the new agri-environment monitoring 
contract.

A new Knowledge Transfer Development 
Programme for Climate Change – to be 
launched in July 2009 – will deliver advice 
regarding on-farm energy efficiency and 
renewables, soil carbon and woodland 
management.

The Rural Development Plan for Wales 
is being implemented using expenditure 
under the EU Rural Development Regulation 
for 2007-13, of which Environmental 
Stewardship is a key part. Addressing  
climate change is an integral element of  
this programme.

From January 2012 a new agri-environment 
scheme, Glastir, will be introduced and will 
have a strong focus on tackling climate 
change. This is includes promoting land 
management techniques that preserve soil 
carbon and a grant scheme to support the 
development of on-farm renewables.

The Welsh Assembly Government is also 
preparing road maps from production to 
consumption of red meat and dairy as a way 
of analysing the greenhouse gas emissions 
and water use at all stages of the food chain. 
It will then produce an action plan to reduce 
the emissions.

Through the Forestry Commission, the 
Assembly Government is responsible for 
the public forest estate that cover 6% of 
Wales’ land, as well as the regulation of 
the remaining privately owned woodlands. 
In total, woodland amounts to almost 14% 
of land cover in Wales and the Assembly 
Government has the ability to increase 
this area either through direct intervention 
by adding to the public forest estate or by 
encouraging farmers and other landowners 
to plant new woodland. The Welsh Assembly 
Government is committed to increasing the 
woodland cover and an initial annual target of 
1,500 hectares over the next three years is in 
place.

Woodlands for Wales, the Welsh Assembly 
Government’s strategy for woodlands and 
trees, focuses on striking a balance between 
sequestration and retaining of carbon in 
woodlands, and substitution of more carbon-
intensive substances with wood (for example 
in buildings or as fuel).

New farming methods are reducing greenhouse  
gas emissions

196 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

This Transition Plan shows how the 
Government will act to reduce emissions 
within the UK in the traded sector, where 
emissions are projected to fall significantly, 
and in the rest of the economy (the non-
traded sector). Emissions in the traded sector, 
for the purposes of accounting under the 
Climate Change Act, are fixed at the level of 
the UK’s share of the declining EU Emissions 
Trading System cap. This will be equal to the 
level of auctioning rights the UK receives plus 
the number of EU allowances that are freely 
allocated to UK installations. Combined with 
the emissions reductions that measures in 
the non-traded sector are expected to deliver 
shows how the UK, on central projections, 
will meet the first three carbon budgets.

Table A1 below sets out estimates of the 
emissions reductions from some of the 
existing measures (including many from the 
2000 and 2006 Climate Change Programmes) 
that are already reducing emissions in the 
non-traded sector and which are included in 
the baseline emissions projections. 

Tables A2 and A3 set out the emissions 
savings in the Non-Traded Sector from the 
additional measures set out in this Transition 
Plan. Table A4 aggregates these emissions 
savings and those from activities in the EU 
ETS, providing a summary of total projected 
emissions savings3. This is presented for the 
third budget in Chart A1.1

number of EU allowances that are freely allocated to UK installations.

 Unless otherwise stated these estimates are derived from DECC’s Energy Model.
 The estimated carbon savings in the table are the mid-points in ranges, and represent the ‘most likely’ or expected outcome from delivering policy.
 The savings from the policies, when modelled in the DECC energy model, are slightly higher than the appraised savings from the individual policies 

owing to interactions within the model. The interaction effect is small relative to the volume of appraised savings – see the Analytical Annex to this

5.  Product policy savings are negative in the non-traded sector because of the heat replacement effect: more energy efficient products produce 
less ambient heat, which needs replacing via alternative fuel sources. Overall, product policy provides a significant net benefit, due to savings in 
emissions in the traded sector and their associated benefits.

6.  The ambition for CERT was extended in the 2007 Energy White Paper, and a 20% uplift to the target was proposed in September 2008. While the 
savings are presented here as if they are additional to the baseline, please note that a proportion of this ambition was announced prior to the 2007 
Energy White Paper.

7.  This includes the savings from the proposed extension to CERT to the end of 2012.
8.  Zero Carbon Homes figures presented here refer to the onsite energy efficiency elements of zero carbon homes from 2016, including the 

tightening of Building Regulations energy efficiency standards in 2010 and 2013. Carbon savings from on- and offsite renewable energy were 
removed so as not to overlap with Feed-In-Tariffs and the Renewable Heat Incentive, for which zero carbon homes would be eligible. See analytical 
annex for more details.

9.  Includes Energy Performance Certificates, Display Energy Certificates for public buildings, inspections for air conditioning systems, and advice and 
guidance for boiler users.

10.  Estimated savings from residential smart meters have been revised in a separate exercise, which is not reflected in the table above, please 
see: The impact assessment of a GB-wide smart meter roll out for the domestic sector, available from: www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/
consultations/smart_metering/smart_metering.aspx. The latest work suggests that in total the savings shown in the table above are broadly 
accurate, but more weighted to the non-traded sector and to later years than is suggested above.

 Policies and proposals

11. Emission reductions from crop management and fertiliser use, enteric fermentation and manure management.
12. There will be emissions reductions in earlier years as measures introduced to secure reductions in the third carbon budget period take hold. 

Because these earlier reductions aren’t precisely known, the Government considers it more prudent not to include these reductions in emissions 
projections now.

13. Emissions reductions are intended to average to these figures across the third carbon budget period, but may not correspond to the exact figures 
shown in each individual year.

14. This includes reducing emissions associated with the landfilling of biogenic material such as food and wood.
15. EU Emissions Trading System Phase 3.
16. The savings from the package of policies, when modelled in the DECC energy model, are slightly higher than the appraised savings from the 

individual policies owing to interactions within the model. The interaction effect is small relative to the volume of appraised savings – see the 
Analytical Annex to this Transition Plan.

204 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

Emissions, for the purposes of accounting 
under the Climate Change Act, from activities 
covered by the EU Emissions Trading System 
(the Traded Sector) are fixed at the level of the 
UK’s share of the EU ETS cap. This will be 
equal to the level of auctioning rights the UK 
receives plus the number of EU allowances 
that are freely allocated to UK installations.

Policies that reduce emissions in the UK in 
the Traded Sector will have no effect on the 

level of EU-wide emissions, or the net UK 
carbon account. They will, however, reduce 
the UK’s net import of carbon units, with 
associated economic benefits. The carbon 
unit savings resulting from policies and 
measures in the baseline are set out in  
Table A5

The savings resulting from the proposals and 
policies set out in this Transition Plan are set 
out in Table A6.17

23. The ambition for CERT was extended in the 2007 Energy White Paper, and a 20% uplift to the target was proposed in September 2008. While the 
savings are presented here as if they are additional to the baseline, please note that a proportion of this ambition was announced prior to the 2007 
Energy White Paper.

24. This includes the savings from the proposed extension to CERT to the end of 2012.
25. Zero Carbon Homes figures presented here refer to the onsite energy efficiency elements of zero carbon homes from 2016, including the 

tightening of Building Regulations energy efficiency standards in 2010 and 2013. Carbon savings from on- and offsite renewable energy were 
removed so as not to overlap with Feed-In-Tariffs and the Renewable Heat Incentive, for which zero carbon homes would be eligible. See analytical 
annex for more details.

Indicative Annual 
Ranges
Having set the carbon budget for a budgetary 
period, section 12 of the Climate Change Act 
requires the Government to publish indicative 
annual ranges showing where it expects ‘the 
net UK carbon account’ to fall in each year of 
the budgetary period. This annex meets the 
requirement of section 12 in respect of the 
first three budgetary periods. 

The net UK carbon account is what the 
Government compares against the carbon 
budgets to determine whether they are being 
met – it must not exceed the carbon budget 
at the end of each budgetary period. It is 
calculated by first taking net UK emissions 
(i.e. aggregate gross emissions from sources 
in the UK, adjusted to take into account 
removals by sinks). These are adjusted to 
account for any carbon units which have been 
brought in from overseas by Government and 
others to offset UK emissions (‘credits’), and 
UK carbon units which have been disposed of 
to a third party (‘debits’). 

As the Government plans not to use credits 
in the non-traded sector to meet carbon 
budgets, the expectation for the net UK 
carbon account corresponds to the projected 
net UK emissions, taking into account the 
expected level of credits or debits due to 
the use or disposal of carbon units by UK 
participants in the EU Emissions Trading 
System.

The indicative annual ranges for the first three 
carbon budgets are shown in Chart A2 and 
Table A7 below. The levels have been set with 
reference to the uncertainty ranges based 
on the central economic growth forecast in 
the latest emissions projections (discussed in 

the separate analytical annex and emissions  
projections publication).31 It can therefore be 
expected, with a high degree of confidence 
(95%), that the net UK carbon account will 
fall within the range for each year. 

The Government considers it very unlikely 
that the account will be at the upper bound 
of the range in each year, and these ranges 
should not be interpreted as an indication 
that this would be satisfactory. Falling at, or 
near, the upper bound in each year would 
be incompatible with meeting the carbon 
budgets, even taking into account the 
provision to borrow from the next budget 
period, and may also be incompatible with 
compliance with EU obligations.32 Further 
action may be required if the net UK carbon 
account were at or near the upper bound 
in any year to bring about the necessary 
reductions in future levels of the account. 
The Government’s general approach to 
dealing with this uncertainty is set out in 
chapter 2 and discussed in more detail in the 
analytical annex to this Plan. 

The annual statement of emissions required 
under section 16 of the Climate Change Act 
will set out the actual net UK carbon account 
for each year. This will show whether the 
account is within the ranges identified in this 
annex. The first such statement, in respect of 
the net UK carbon account for 2008, must be 
published by 31 March 2010.

Projected sectoral 
contribution to the net 
UK carbon account
Chart A3 plots projected UK greenhouse gas 
emissions by sources minus removals by 
sinks against the projected net UK carbon 
account, to show the expected contribution 
of emissions trading under the EU Emissions 
Trading System to meeting carbon budgets. 
This illustrates that the Government expects 

UK participants in the EU ETS to vary over 
the three budget periods between being net 
sellers and net purchasers of carbon units 
from abroad.”

Table A8 shows the expected contribution to 
the net UK carbon account by sector (using 
the sectorial split used in this Transition 
Plan). Table A9 shows the same information, 
but splits the sectors in the way in which 
the Government reports in the National 
Communication to the UNFCCC.33

34.  These projections may differ marginally from the estimates in the Carbon Reduction Strategy for Transport, due to both the inclusion of military 
aviation and shipping emissions in the projections provided here, and the use of the DECC Energy Model (rather than the DfT’s National Transport 
Model) to derive the results. See http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/economics/ntm/roadtransportforcasts08/rtf08.pdf for more detail about the differences

carbon budgets




216 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan
 National strategy for climate and energy

As set out in chapter 2, to ensure that every 
part of government takes responsibility 
for delivery of the UK’s carbon budgets, 
the Government is introducing a system 
of departmental carbon budgets. This 
new approach will be the first time any 
government has introduced such an 
accountability mechanism, and will serve 
as a pilot that will be reviewed ahead of the 
second  budget period (2013-2017).

Under this new system, each government 
Department will hold its own carbon budget 
made up of two elements: 

a.  one representing its relative degree of 
influence on reducing emissions from  

each sector of the economy; and 

b.  one reflecting the emissions from the 
part of the public sector that it has 

responsibility for.

To determine each Department’s relative 
degree of influence over the various parts of 
the economy, a broad set of factors has been 
taken into consideration:

a. Where a Department holds policy levers 
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 
for which a specific projected impact on 
cutting emissions can be identified (for 
instance, regulations on building or  
product standards);

b. Responsibility for policies, policy areas and 
economic activity which result in increases 
in emissions, whether as a direct result of 
economic activity or of creating demand 
for that activity (for example, increased 
transport emissions as a result of the 
school run or freight haulage); and

c. The overarching responsibility and 
influence of particular government 
Departments with respect to those areas 
of the economy which they most closely 
sponsor, and for whom they are the main 
point of contact in Government.

This inevitably results in a broad 
approximation, rather than an exact 
measurement, of a Department’s relative 
degree of influence over a sector’s 
emissions. The budgets are not designed to 
demonstrate the precise contribution that a 
Department will make to reducing emissions 
from a particular sector. 

Instead, analogous with Public Service 
Agreements, their purpose is to give 
Departments a stake in reducing emissions 
from a given sector. Importantly, the only 
way that a Department can deliver its carbon 
budget is to work with other Departments, 
to ensure that emissions from each sector in 
which it has a stake are reduced to the levels 
required to meet the UK’s carbon budget.

With respect to emissions from the wider 
public sector, the intention is that over time 
the Government will seek to include in 
Departments’ carbon budgets the emissions 
from the parts of the public sector that fall 
within their respective areas of responsibility. 

As a first step the departmental carbon 
budgets shown below include emissions 
from central government, based on the 
existing Sustainable Operations on the 
Government Estate framework and a target 
to reduce CO2 emissions from office 
buildings by 30% by 2020 from a 1999-
2000 baseline; and from Departments’ own 
administrative transport, by 30% from a 
2005-06 baseline. 

The remainder of emissions from the public 
sector have, for the moment, been included 
in the Department of Energy and Climate 
Change carbon budget, given its policy 
responsibility for the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment. However, the Government’s 
intention is to include emissions from 
schools, the NHS and further and higher 
education institutions in the relevant 
Departments’ carbon budgets by April 2010. 




 Annex B: 217
 Departmental carbon budgets

The table overleaf sets out the carbon 
budgets for each major Whitehall  
Department in each of the first three  
carbon budget periods. 

At the end of the first budget period, each 
Department’s outturn against its carbon 
budget will be assessed based on its share  
of responsibility for emissions from each 
sector of the economy, and how well 
that sector has succeeded in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.

If, in future, unexpected changes in 
circumstances mean that there is a 
shortfall against the UK’s carbon budgets, 
the Government may need to purchase 
international credits in order to meet its 
obligations under the Climate Change Act, 
effectively imposing a financial liability on  
the Government. This means that there 
could be real financial consequences for 
Government if it does not achieve its carbon 
budgets through domestic emissions 
reductions alone.

The departmental carbon budgets will be the 
subject of review over the first budget period, 
looking at a number of factors:

a. How well these budgets support the 
effective operation of a system to manage 
the UK’s carbon budgets;

b. How well the initial allocations reflect the 
real influence that each Department has for 
each sector of the economy; 

c. How best to take account of the extent to 
which responsibility for different sectors 
of the economy is devolved in Scotland, 
Wales and Northern Ireland, which will 
require further analysis and discussion with 
the devolved administrations; and

d. How best to capture the emission 
reductions that we want to deliver from 
across every part of the public sector.

 National strategy for climate and energy

Household savings: 

Won’t cost you a penny – do this week!

1.  Switch off appliances when not in use to 
save £30 per year. 

2.  Only boiling as much water as you need 
could save you up to £25 a year. 

3.  In centrally-heated houses, try turning your 
thermostat down by 1ºC. Provided you are 
still comfortable, you could reduce CO


2 


emissions and cut your fuel bill by up to 10%.

Will cost a little but you will save 

money almost immediately – do 

within the next few weeks

4.  Swap traditional light bulbs with energy 
saving ones and you will save £60 over the 
lifetime of the bulb.

5.  Fitting your hot water tank with an 
insulating jacket will only cost a few 
pounds and, with all the heat it traps, it 
pays for itself within six months. Fit one 
that’s at least 75mm (3 inches) thick and 
you could save around £30 a year. 

Will involve upfront costs, but you 

will save money over the longer term

6.  Fitting loft insulation to the recommended 
amount (270mm) could save you up to 
£100 a year. Even if you already have 
insulation you could still save up to £30  
per year by topping up.

7.  Cavity wall insulation can take a matter of 
hours to install and could save you £150 a 
year on fuel bills.

8.  Installing draught excluders where there 
are gaps could save you £20 a year.

9.  If your house does not yet have double 
glazing, installing it could save up to £80  
a year.

10.  Replace a boiler (10-15 years old) with 
an energy efficient condensing boiler 
(‘A’ rated) and suitable controls (e.g. 
thermostats) could save you up to £90 
each year.

11.  Replace white goods with energy saving 
recommended appliances, and you could 
save between £5 and £20 each year.

Workplace savings:

Things you can do now to benefit your 
business, save energy and reduce 
emissions

1.  Let your customers and suppliers know 
you’re committed to reducing your 
environmental impact, and promote 
it through your marketing: more than 
a third of consumers would favour a 
product that is environmentally friendly.

2.  Turn off all office equipment when 
you’re not using it: a single computer 
and monitor left on 24 hours a day will 
cost over £50  
a year.

3.  Examine waste disposal costs and 
consider partnering with a nearby 
business to recycle your waste. Look 
at whether your waste could be turned 
into another business’ raw materials: 
your business can save 4–5% of its 
turnover by using waste minimisation 
techniques.

4.  Keep heating at a constant level and 
ensure doors and windows are shut  
when using heating or air conditioning: 
your heating costs will go up by10% 
each time you increase the temperature 
by one degree.

5.  Minimise the need for travel, and drive 
efficiently when travel is necessary: 
business with five company cars could 
save £5,300 a year through employees 
driving more efficiently.

6.  Print double-sided and use refillable 
printer, fax and photocopier cartridges:  
your business can refill inkjet cartridges  
for about half the price of a new one.

Driving savings

Following these six ‘eco driving’ tips could 
save you money and cut your emissions:

1.  Pump tyres up to the correct pressure 
as stated in your car manual. Under-
inflated tyres mean that more fuel is 
used and more CO


2

 emissions 

are produced. 

2.  Less clutter in your car means less CO


2: 


clutter in your boot is extra weight your 
engine has to carry around. 

3.  Driving at an appropriate speed 
reduces CO


2

 and increases your safety. 

Speed limits are the maximum lawful 
speeds which may be driven in ideal 
circumstances. At 70mph you could be 
using up to 9 per cent more fuel than at 
60mph and up to 15 per cent more fuel 
than at 50mph.

4.  Less stopping and starting means less 


CO2

: Keep an eye on the traffic ahead 

and slow down early by gently lifting 
your foot off the accelerator while 
keeping the car in gear. 

5.  Over-revving accelerates emissions: 
modern car engines are designed to 
be efficient from the moment they 
are switched on, so revving up like a 
Formula 1 car on the starting grid only 
wastes fuel and increases engine wear. 

6.  When the engine is idling you’re wasting 
fuel and adding to CO


2

 emissions. If 

you’re likely to be at a standstill for more 
than three minutes, simply switch off 
the engine.
