8 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

Executive summary 
The UK urgently needs new policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Parliament has made 
commitments and the Government has a legal duty to propose policies to meet them. Despite 
this, no significant new policy plans have been published in the 11 months since the fifth carbon 
budget was set. Climate change will not wait while other priorities are addressed: plans must be 
published without delay, setting out how the Government intends to deliver the budget, which 
requires a 57% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2030. 
Recent reductions in emissions should not detract from the urgent need for new policies to 
bring confidence to investors and to enable future targets to be met. Although UK emissions fell 
6% in 2016 and are down 19% since 2012, progress has been dominated by the power sector. 
Carbon dioxide emissions from transport and buildings rose in 2015 and 2016, while progress in 
driving emissions reductions in industry and for non-CO2 greenhouse gases has been minimal.  
Despite promising advances in low-carbon technologies like electric cars and renewable power 
generation, emissions will not continue to fall without new and strengthened policies, and the 
fourth and fifth carbon budgets will be missed.  
This report assesses recent progress and identifies the areas where new policies are needed. Our 
full set of recommendations is set out in Table 2. Our key messages are as follows: 
• UK emissions have fallen while the economy has grown, but progress will not continue

without new policies. It would be wrong to assume that the UK has permanently shifted to
a path of falling emissions. Three-quarters of the decline in emissions from 2012 to 2016 has
come from the reduction in the use of coal for power generation, which is now at low levels.
Eliminating the remaining coal-fired generation would deliver less than two years' worth of
the required progress to 2030. In stark contrast, emissions from transport (which make up
26% of total emissions) were higher in 2016 than in any year since 2009.

• The Government must publish plans to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
without further delay. Delays in extending policies into the 2020s are failing to meet the
needs of low-carbon investors or the requirements of the Climate Change Act. To avoid
derailing past good progress those plans must be published now.

• New policies are needed across the economy. By 2030, current plans would at best deliver
around half of the required reduction in emissions, 100-170 MtCO2e per year short of what is
required by the carbon budgets. An effective set of proposals to close this policy gap must:
extend the approach to signing contracts for low-carbon power; extend and strengthen
policies to switch to low-carbon vehicles; undertake a major overhaul of policy so as to cut
emissions from buildings; and deliver a programme for carbon capture and storage.

• The broader context underlines the importance and value of UK carbon budgets.
‒ Leaving the EU will change how carbon budgets are met. But it does not change either

the need to cut emissions or the level of the carbon budgets, which are set in UK law. 
‒ Costs continue to fall for key low-carbon technologies such as wind power and electric 

vehicles whilst performance is improving fast. 
‒ Although the US Federal Government has signalled its intention to leave the Paris 

Agreement, many US States, cities, businesses and other major emitters like the EU, China 
and India have recommitted to the agreement, which has now entered into force.  

‒ The transition to a low-carbon economy should be a key part of the UK's industrial 
strategy and offers significant co-benefits particularly for air quality and health. 

The rest of this summary sets out our assessment of these four areas. 




Executive summary 9 

Progress in reducing emissions 

Total UK emissions of greenhouse gases fell by 6% in 2016 to 466 million tonnes of CO2-
equivalent (MtCO2e). That continues a trend of large annual falls in emissions (averaging 5% per 
year) since 2012. Emissions are now 42% below 1990 levels, while the economy has grown by 
over 60% (Figure 1).  

Since the Climate Change Act was passed in 2008, energy bills for the typical household have 
also fallen in real terms, as the benefits of improving energy efficiency have more than offset the 
increased cost of using renewable power generation, rising international gas prices and the 
increased number of electrical appliances in the home.1 

It would be wrong to assume that, given strong recent progress, economic growth has been 
permanently decoupled from growth in emissions. Progress will need to extend beyond the 
power and waste sectors if carbon budgets are to be met while the economy continues to grow: 

• 75% of the emissions reductions since 2012 have resulted from reduced burning of coal in
the power sector (Figure 2). This is now at low levels, with limited potential for further
reductions. Even if all coal generation stopped, which is the Government’s announced
intention by 2025, emissions would only fall by around 16 MtCO2e, the equivalent of less
than two years' worth of further progress required to 2030.

• In other sectors, recent progress has been far more limited or emissions have been rising:

‒ Transport emissions have risen three years in a row to their highest level since 2009. This
reflects rising demand for travel and a slowing of progress in improving the efficiency of 
new vehicles. In contrast, our scenarios for meeting the fifth carbon budget require 
transport emissions to reduce by an average of 4% per year to 2030. 

‒ Buildings emissions have risen in the last two years, with the trend only partly 
attributable to lower winter temperatures than in 2014. Most boilers have now been 
replaced with efficient condensing models (around 70% in 2016) and rates of installing 
insulation have been very low since 2012. Uptake of heat pumps and district heating 
remain minimal and new buildings with high-carbon heating systems are still being built. 

‒ Industry emissions fell in 2016, but over half of the reduction reflected reduced iron and 
steel production rather than improvements to energy productivity or shifts to low-carbon 
fuels. Plant closures have not been a result of climate policies since these had at most a 
marginal effect on relative plant economics (see Chapter 4). Effective policy is now 
needed to support UK industry to move towards low-carbon production methods. 

‒ Non-CO2 emissions data are not yet available for 2016, but in 2015 agriculture and F-gas 
emissions remained broadly flat and at their highest levels since 2007 and 2010 
respectively. That is despite significant low-cost opportunities to cut emissions in both 
areas. Waste emissions have fallen strongly since 1996, but may now be flattening out. 

The rapid falls in emissions since 2012 demonstrate that Government policy can successfully 
influence behaviour to cut emissions - the UK's carbon price floor and support for investment in 
renewable power have driven the reductions in coal use, while the landfill tax and policies to 
reduce waste and encourage recycling have helped cut waste emissions. Effective policy to 
reduce emissions must now be extended across the economy to ensure that progress continues. 

1 See CCC (2017), Energy prices and bills – impacts of meeting carbon budgets. The average energy bill for a dual-fuel 
household with gas heating was £1,280 in 2008 and £1,160 in 2016 (both in 2016 prices). Household gas use fell 
23% in this period while electricity use fell 17%.

Executive summary 11 

Principles for the Government's plans for meeting the carbon budgets 

In July 2016, after the vote to leave the EU, the Government legislated the fifth carbon budget. 
That budget sets a cap on UK emissions of greenhouse gases over 2028-2032. The budget 
requires that emissions are cut by at least 57% from 1990 to 2030 (26% from 2016 to 2030). The 
budget is based on the Committee’s best estimate of the lowest-cost path to the UK’s long-term 
target to reduce emissions by at least 80% by 2050 relative to 1990. 

When setting the fifth carbon budget, the Government acknowledged that new and stronger 
policies would be needed to meet it and the existing fourth carbon budget (covering 2023-2027, 
and for which previous plans have not been translated into firm policies). The Government had 
committed to publish new plans to meet the budgets by the end of 2016. This would have been 
consistent with previous legislative timelines in 2008 and 2010, when plans to meet the third 
and fourth carbon budgets were published within six months of each budget being agreed by 
Parliament. 

There have been delays from the vote to leave the EU, the change in Prime Minister and the 
general election. Continued delay would conflict with the requirement in the Climate Change 
Act to publish plans 'as soon as is reasonably practicable' after the budget is set.2 Avoiding delay 
is crucial to unlocking investment throughout the supply chain, given the significant lead-times 
from policy development to a response from investors and consumers. 

Under the Climate Change Act, the Government's new plans must enable the carbon budgets 
and the 2050 target to be met. Proposals should be flexible and credible, integrated with other 
policy priorities and should include clear timelines to move from proposals to actions: 

• The plans must enable the carbon budgets to be met and prepare for the 2050 target.

‒ The numbers must add up – taken together the Government’s policies and proposals
must be expected to deliver the emissions reductions required by the carbon budgets. 
The aim should be to meet the budgets without the use of international carbon units (i.e. 
credits) outside the EU Emissions Trading System.3  

‒ The Act also specifies that plans must prepare for meeting the 2050 target to cut 
emissions by at least 80% relative to 1990. As well as reducing emissions to 2032, 
proposals should lay the ground for further reductions in the 2030s and 2040s. That 
implies, for example, that it will be important to develop carbon capture and storage and 
to prepare for a widespread shift away from natural gas for heating. 

• Policy proposals should be flexible, robust, and joined-up with other priorities.

‒ Proposals should be flexible with respect to various uncertainties.

 That includes uncertainties over how policies currently applied at the EU level will
operate after the UK leaves the EU. The Committee's previous analysis suggests that
EU-level policies currently cover around half of the UK's potential emissions

2 Climate Change Act (2016), clause 14. 
3 If unexpected circumstances mean the budget cannot be met cost-effectively without recourse to purchase of 
credits, the Committee would revisit this advice, including an assessment of the strength and validity of the credit 
market at that time. Credits could also be used to go beyond the proposed budget to support international action 
to reduce emissions. For those sectors covered by the EU ETS, the Government’s plans should set out not just the 
expected cap in the trading scheme, but also how policy will reduce actual emissions and ensure that investments 
stay on track to 2050. 




12 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

reductions to 2030.4 New UK policies will be needed to reduce emissions where 
policies previously agreed through the EU no longer apply or are weakened. 

 Proposals should also leave open the possibility of reducing emissions more quickly
than required by the budgets, given that the Paris Agreement has more ambitious
aims to limit global temperature increase than the aims on which the UK's carbon
budgets are based.

 Policy should be flexible to uncertainties relating to changing technology and
behaviour, including potential changes to travel behaviour and energy use as
autonomous vehicles and smart technologies become more widespread.

‒ Proposals should address areas with no current policy and where there are risks that 
existing policy will under-deliver. For example, efficiency standards for new vehicles must 
be extended beyond 2020 and to HGVs, but should also be strengthened to reflect real-
world driving performance more closely. 

‒ Proposals should be joined-up with other policy priorities, including the industrial 
strategy, the review of energy costs, efforts to improve air quality and actions to prepare 
for the impacts of a changing climate.  

• There should be a clear process to turn proposals into action.

‒ Where plans are only presented at the proposal stage there should be clear timelines for
translating these into firm and funded policy and actions. For example, for residential 
heating an overhaul of the current policy approach is needed, and some aspects will 
require initial consultation, followed by implementation before current policies expire 
around 2020. 

‒ The Government should set out how it intends to monitor progress and adjust plans to 
remain on track. For example, the Government could link reviews to the annual Progress 
Reports provided by the Committee and/or to the annual emissions projections5 that 
BEIS already produces. 

Table 1 sets out an example package of outcomes that would be consistent with the 
requirements of the Climate Change Act. These reflect the scenarios produced for the 
Committee's advice on the fifth carbon budget and our best estimate of the lowest-cost path to 
the 2050 target. The Government may choose to aim for a different balance of effort, but any 
areas with less effort would need to be balanced by increased effort elsewhere.

Source: Scenarios for CCC (2015) The Fifth Carbon Budget. 
Notes: The fifth carbon budget requires a 26% reduction in the UK's net carbon account from 2016 to 2030. 
However, this allows for trading in the EU ETS, where the UK is expected to be a net seller of allowances. On the 
basis of actual emissions and the latest projections the Committee scenarios involve a 36% reduction (equivalent 
to a 63% reduction from 1990 to 2030). This would keep the UK on the lowest-cost path to the 2050 target and to 
meet the fifth carbon budget taking account of possible trading of allowances within the EU ETS. 

Policy priorities for the Government's plans 

An effective policy package to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets must target emissions 
reductions across the economy, tackling financial and non-financial barriers to action and 
addressing innovation and infrastructure challenges. 

Current policies would leave a gap of at least around 100 MtCO2e in 2030 compared to what is 
required by the fifth carbon budget. Risks to those policies delivering in full (e.g. because of the 
failure of new vehicle emissions targets to take account of the discrepancy between testing and 
real-world driving conditions) mean the gap could be as large as 170 MtCO2e (Figure 3). 




14 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

Table 2, at the end of this summary, sets out the full set of areas where the Committee has 
identified a need for stronger policy, new policies and new strategic approaches. Particular 
priorities are in low-carbon power generation, the shifts to low-carbon vehicles and to low-
carbon heating and development of carbon capture and storage (CCS): 

• Low-carbon power. The Government should plan to award contracts for a further 80-100
TWh of low-carbon generation in the 2020s, beyond the planned auctions for offshore wind
and the contract for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C.

• Transport. Stretching standards based on real-world testing are needed for new cars and
vans beyond 2020. These should require a significant take-up of electric (or other ultra-low
emission) vehicles, supported by additional Government policies (e.g. support for a national
charging network and preferential tax treatment).

• Heat. A clear, combined strategy for energy efficiency and low-carbon heat is needed. It
must significantly increase the delivery of energy efficiency measures, heat networks and
heat pumps in cost-effective locations for both households and businesses. It should also
test the possibility for low-carbon hydrogen to meet heat demand.

Executive summary 15 

Broader circumstances relevant to climate policy 

The UK's carbon budgets have been set at levels that reflect the need for steady progress in 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, taking into account a range of criteria including costs, 
competitiveness, and climate science. 

Changes in international circumstances have underlined the importance of the UK carbon 
budgets: 

• The future impacts of leaving the EU. Leaving the EU would change how carbon budgets
are delivered: where policies previously agreed at EU level no longer apply or are weakened,
new UK policies will need to replace them. But it does not change the need to cut emissions,
the level of the carbon budgets (which are set in UK law) or the duty on the Government to


act.


• The Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is the first fully global deal to cut emissions and
tackle climate change and has now come into force. The announced withdrawal by the
United States has been followed by renewed commitment from a number of other countries
(including the UK, China, India and the EU) as well as many States, cities and businesses
within the US. The Committee published advice in light of the Paris Agreement in October
2016, where we concluded that the most important contribution the UK Government can
make now to the Paris Agreement is publishing a robust plan to meet the UK carbon budgets
and delivering policies in line with the plan.6

• Global temperature increase. 2016 was the hottest year on record with global
temperatures around 1.1°C higher than in the late 1800s. Each of the last three decades has
been successively the hottest decade on record.

Furthermore, progress in low-carbon technologies and policies across the world is 
strengthening the case for the transition to a low-carbon economy: 

• Wind and solar power are now the cheapest forms of electricity in many markets, with the
potential to deliver low-carbon power without subsidy in the UK if they are allowed to
compete for long-term contracts.

• Many countries have set ambitious goals for take-up of electric cars (e.g. India, China,
Norway, the Netherlands, various US states), and new models with longer ranges are being
introduced across car classes and manufacturers in the UK this year and next.

• 142 countries have submitted pledges to reduce emissions under the Paris process. 125 have
also put in place their own domestic climate laws, including the UK Climate Change Act. By
the end of 2017, 22% of global greenhouse gas emissions are due to be covered by carbon
pricing schemes, as China commences national emissions trading.

Overall carbon budgets are still expected to involve some financial costs since many low-carbon 
technologies are currently more expensive than high-carbon alternatives. However, these costs 
are small relative to the costs of dangerous climate change and were accepted by Parliament 
when the fifth carbon budget was set. For the UK to contribute to tackling dangerous climate 
change, the budgets are aligned to our best estimate of the lowest-cost path to do so.  

The transition to a low-carbon economy is already underway and presents opportunities for UK 
businesses, both new and existing firms. Grasping those opportunities and ensuring a smooth 
transition must be integral to the Government's new industrial strategy:

16 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

• The UK low-carbon economy is already estimated to employ hundreds of thousands of
people and contribute around 2-3% of GDP, which is a comparable size to energy-intensive
manufacturing. It has been growing faster than the rest of the economy.

• Following the Paris Agreement, global demand for low-carbon goods and services is set to
expand many times over to 2030 and then again to 2050. UK businesses must adapt to meet
this need in place of the declining demand for high-carbon goods and services.

• The UK is particularly well-placed to take advantage of growing global markets for: low-
emission vehicles; low-carbon finance, insurance and consulting; low-carbon electricity;
smart grids and energy efficient products.

Reducing emissions also brings important co-benefits, particularly for health, resulting from 
improved air quality, better insulated housing, reduced noise and more active transport (e.g. 
walking and cycling).  

Efforts at the UK level need to be reinforced and supported by efforts at devolved level. Scotland 
and Wales are both in the process of legislating new emissions targets, the design of which we 
advised on in March: 

• Scotland (9% of UK emissions) has produced a draft Climate Change Plan for meeting its
existing targets, as well as a draft Energy Strategy. We will comment on these in our Scottish
progress report in the Autumn.

• Wales (9% of UK emissions) will set the levels of their first two carbon budgets in 2018,
following advice from the Committee in Autumn this year. Welsh Ministers will then publish
a report setting out their proposals and policies for meeting them.

• Northern Ireland (4% of UK emissions) does not have its own climate legislation. However, it
will have to contribute to emissions reductions if the UK targets are to be met.

The rest of this report provides an economy-wide view of progress, followed by assessments of 
progress and policy priorities across the emitting sectors of the economy. This report, Volume 2, 
is published alongside Volume 3, which covers progress in preparing the UK for the impacts of a 
changing climate and Volume 1, which provides a synthesis across Volumes 2 and 3.

Key messages and recommendations 

This Progress Report sets out our view, as required under the Climate Change Act, on progress towards 
meeting the statutory carbon budgets and the 2050 target to reduce emissions by at least 80% 
compared to 1990 levels. It assesses the policy risks around delivering these targets and identifies key 
priorities for the Government to address in its plan for reducing emissions to meet the fourth and fifth 
carbon budgets. 

Overall emissions fell by 6% in 2016 and are now 42% lower than in 1990, around halfway towards the 
2050 target. 

Our key messages for the economy as a whole are: 

• UK emissions fell by 6% in 2016 but progress was unbalanced. The reduction was almost
entirely from electricity generation, where emissions fell 24% as coal generation fell rapidly.

• There has been very limited progress in developing the policy framework to drive emissions
reduction. Policy strengthening will be required to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets.

‒ The Climate Change Act puts a duty on the Secretary of State to bring forward 'proposals and
policies' to meet carbon budgets. The Government has not yet published its plans. 

‒ In this report we identify a gap of around100 MtCO2e - around half of the total required 
emissions reduction - between current Government plans and the path required to meet the 
fifth carbon budget in 2030. In addition, we assess that over three-quarters of the emissions 
reduction targeted by existing plans and policies (around 70 MtCO2e) are at risk unless existing 
plans are implemented more strongly.  

‒ New policies are required to take forward low-carbon electricity generation, carbon capture 
and storage, new car and van CO2 standards, and low-carbon heating. Existing policies need to 
be strengthened to ensure they do not under-deliver, including in transport (e.g. financial 
support for electric vehicles and roll-out of recharging infrastructure) and buildings (e.g. to 
increase installation rates of insulation and improve uptake of low-carbon heating options). 

‒ The Government's plan should be flexible to uncertainties - including from Brexit - so that 
carbon budgets will be met even if circumstances are different to central expectations. 

• Government plans to meet carbon budgets must include options to prepare for deeper
emission reductions beyond 2030, to meet the 2050 target. Achieving this target, of at least an
80% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels, in the most cost-effective way requires immediate
and substantial progress in a number of key areas. These include carbon capture and storage, low-
carbon heating and transport, greenhouse gas removal and the appropriate use of sustainable
bioenergy.

In terms of cross-cutting priorities, we will assess the Government's plan for meeting the fourth and 
fifth carbon budgets against the following checklist (Table 1.1).

A new strategic approach to carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
deployment in the UK, including preparations for possible use in the 
production of low-carbon hydrogen. CCS could enable large-scale 
emissions reduction from electricity generation and industry, plus the 
production of hydrogen. The new approach should include separation 
of support for CO2 infrastructure, a new funding mechanism for 
industrial CCS and some sharing of risks across parties, and with 
Government, especially where they reflect future policy uncertainty. 
Contracts should be awarded by 2020 to allow operations at scale in 
the 2030s. 



  


An updated strategy for increasing the supply of sustainable 
bioenergy feedstock and using it effectively. This is important for 
reducing emissions where there are limited alternative options. The 
use of sustainable bioenergy in conjunction with CCS has the potential 
to remove greenhouse gases from the air. The Government's previous 
plans were published in 2012 and should be updated. 


 

A strategy for developing options for removing greenhouse gases 
from the air, alongside innovation in hard-to-treat sectors. 
Currently there are no clear routes to complete decarbonisation in 
sectors such as aviation, agriculture and parts of industry. Greenhouse 
gas removal options (e.g. afforestation, carbon-storing materials, 
bioenergy with carbon capture or direct air capture and storage) are 
needed alongside widespread emissions reductions to meet the 2050 
target and beyond.

Chapter 1: Economy-wide progress 23 

Introduction 
In this chapter we review progress reducing emissions across the economy as a whole. We assess 
whether current government policies are on track to meeting carbon budgets and the 2050 
target and, if not, what new actions and policies are required. We also assess international 
progress in reducing emissions. 

We summarise the analysis that underpins our key messages and recommendations in the 
following four sections: 

1. Economy-wide progress reducing emissions

2. Meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets

3. Preparing for the 2050 target

4. International progress in tackling climate change

1. Economy-wide progress reducing emissions
UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell 6% in 2016 to 466 MtCO2e and are now 42% below 1990 
levels. At the same time, the economy has grown by over 60% (Figure 1.1). Allowing for 
differences in temperature between 2015 and 2016 emissions still fell 6% overall.  

Since the Climate Change Act was passed in 2008, energy bills for the average household have 
fallen in real terms as energy efficiency improvements have more than offset the rising cost of 
natural gas and the premium paid for low-carbon electricity (Figure 1.2). 

We estimate that the net carbon account, which allows for international trading of carbon 
permits and is the basis on which achievement of carbon budgets is judged, was at a similar 
level to actual emissions in 2016 at 469 MtCO2e. That is also 42% below 1990 and below the level 
required to meet the second and third carbon budgets (i.e. the emissions limits for 2013-2017 
and 2018-2022, Figure 1.3).  

Continuing the trend since 2012, the largest reduction in emissions in the last year was in the 
power sector, where emissions fell 24% as coal generation fell rapidly (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). 
Industry emissions fell 9% but emissions rose in both transport (1%) and buildings (4%). 

Further substantial reductions in emissions are still required to meet the fourth and fifth carbon 
budgets, which will require significant progress beyond the power sector: 

• The fourth and fifth carbon budgets require reductions of 51% by 2025 and 57% by 2030,
relative to 1990. That implies reductions of around 10 MtCO2e every year.

• These cannot be delivered through reductions in the power sector alone. For example, if all
remaining coal generation were replaced by gas generation, overall emissions would only
fall by another two percentage points - around 16 MtCO2e - to 44% below 1990 levels.

• Similarly, the waste sector has been a significant contributor to recent falls, with emissions
down 8 MtCO2e (31%) since 2012 and 48 MtCO2e (73%) since 1990. However, reductions are
now flattening out, with only around a further 10 MtCO2e potential reduction to 2030.

• The budgets require a 3% reduction in emissions per year from all other sectors, compared to
1% on average since 2012.

The recent good overall progress must not lead to complacency. Although economy-wide 
emissions have fallen rapidly whilst the economy has grown, this cannot be replicated in future

without extending progress to other sectors where emissions are currently increasing rather 
than decreasing. 

Effective measures to reduce emissions should also be accompanied by measures to adapt to 
the impacts and risks from climate change. The link between action to reduce emissions and 
action to prepare for future impacts of climate change is discussed in the accompanying 
summary report Reducing emissions and preparing for climate change, and details of measures to 
adapt to the risks are discussed in the report Progress in preparing for climate change.7 

The headline emissions statistics are based on provisional data for 2016. Both these data and the 
‘final’ statistics for 1990-2015 are subject to revision annually as the emissions inventory is 
updated. We have previously considered the implications for carbon budgets of these and other 
measurement uncertainties8 and conclude: 

• The UK’s existing carbon budgets have been set at the right level and provide a reliable
guide to the required reduction in emissions despite the uncertainty in emissions estimates.

• The methodology for constructing the GHG inventory is rigorous but the process for
identifying improvements could be strengthened.

• A small number of sectors contribute most to uncertainty. Research efforts should be
directed at improving these estimates as the sectors with the largest uncertainty are also the
ones that will decarbonise last.

We will continue to keep these issues and uncertainties under review.

2. Meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
The fourth and fifth carbon budgets (covering the period 2023-2027 and 2028-2032) were set to 
be on the cost-effective path to meeting the UK's 2050 target of at least an 80% reduction in 
GHG emissions compared to 1990. The fifth carbon budget allows for international trading of 
carbon allowances and requires a 57% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon account. 

Our advice on the fifth carbon budget set out the progress required across the economy to meet 
the budgets. That includes: an increase in the share of low-carbon electricity generation from 
45% currently to 75% in 2030, development of carbon capture and storage (CCS), 60% of new 
car sales in 2030 being ultra-low emission vehicles, and at least 25% of heating delivered from 
low-carbon sources (Table 1.2). Ignoring international trading of carbon allowances, the latest 
projections suggest this would deliver a 63% reduction in actual emissions by 2030 (Box 1.1). 

In this section we set out our assessment that current policy plans would fall a long way short of 
delivering the progress required by the budget and our assessment of the policies needed to 
close this gap. 

(a) The size of the policy gap and the requirement for the Government to close it 

In order to assess whether future carbon budgets are likely to be achieved - and any policy gap 
that remains - we review Government plans to reduce emissions. We then compare these to our 
estimates of the cost-effective path required to meet the budgets - the set of actions that we 
identified in our advice as a suitable way to meet the budgets. We assess whether policies are 
expected to deliver emissions savings, where they may fail to deliver, and identify areas where 
there is no policy in place (Box 1.2). 

Our assessment in this report reflects the lack of a new plan from Government setting out how 
the fifth carbon budget will be met. Such a plan is required under the Climate Change Act. 

There has been little policy progress in the past year. Changes announced in the Budget and 
Autumn Statement were limited and include contracts for low-carbon electricity generation in 
the 2020s, additional funding for electric vehicles and investment in new road capacity, and a 
commitment to target a total carbon price. We assess these changes in the relevant chapters of 
this report. 

We conclude that there is currently a policy gap between current Government policies and the 
cost-effective path to meet carbon budgets of at least around 100 MtCO2e in 2030 - half of the 
total reduction required (Figure 1.6). Additionally over three-quarters of current policies are at 
risk of under-delivering. New policies will be required to fill the gap and policy strengthening 
will be required to address the risks of under-delivery.  

Box 1.1. The net carbon account 

Under the Climate Change Act carbon budgets are set, and performance against them measured, on 
the basis of the ‘net carbon account’. The net carbon account can be calculated by adding the UK’s 
share of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) cap and actual emissions from sources not covered 
by the EU ETS. 

The net carbon account will be different from actual UK emissions as the sources of emissions covered 
by the EU ETS (i.e. electricity generation and energy-intensive industry) will not typically equal the UK's 
share of the EU ETS emissions cap. 




28 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

Box 1.1. The net carbon account 

When monitoring progress towards meeting carbon budgets we primarily monitor actual emissions 
against our best estimate for the cost-effective path to the 2050 target, on which the carbon budgets 
have been based. This cost-effective path reflects the actions needed in each sector (e.g. uptake of 
electric vehicles, renewable electricity generation, insulation) in order to reduce emissions and to be on 
track to meet the 2050 target at least cost. 

The fifth carbon budget requires a 57% reduction in the net carbon account from 1990 to 2030. 
Expectations for the cost-effective path for actual emissions now reflect a 63% reduction over that 
period. This compares to an expected 61% reduction when we advised on the budget in 2015. This 
change is due to a lowering of the government’s baseline projection for emissions in the absence of 
policy action. 

However, baseline projections are highly uncertain and could shift back. We therefore base our 
monitoring and recommendations in this report on the same set of actions that we identified for the 
cost-effective path in our 2015 advice. 

It is possible that these actions could lead to emissions that are slightly lower in 2030 than required by 
the legislated budget. However, they are achievable and remain desirable as part of the lowest cost 
path to the 2050 target. In addition, our recommendation to government on the implications of the 
Paris Agreement was to aim to fully deliver all measures. To the extent that this reduces emissions 
further than the budget, this would help support the aim in the Paris Agreement of pursuing efforts to 
limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C.  

Box 1.2. Criteria to evaluate level of risk in Government policies 

The criteria that we use to assess policies are: 

• Design and implementation. We assess whether the design and implementation of the policy
tackles the right barriers; whether the policy has established a track record or there is evidence of
similar policies working before; and whether there are risks to the policy due to various factors such
as lack of coherence or lack of political support. We also assess whether the government’s original
Impact Assessment makes a prudent assessment of the level of abatement delivered by the policy.

• Incentives. We assess whether the right incentives – monetary or regulatory – are in place for the
policy to deliver the necessary abatement.

• Funding. We assess whether, if required, there is adequate funding in place for the policy, both
now and in the future.

If policies meet all three criteria we would expect them to deliver and classify them as 'lower risk', 
whereas if they fail any one of the criteria we classify them as having 'delivery risks'.  

The Climate Change Act requires that the Government develops and publishes a plan to meet 
the carbon budgets.9 It must set out policies and proposals with sufficient ambition to close the 
policy gap to the fourth and fifth carbon budgets. This plan should demonstrate how the 
proposals will be flexible to the various uncertainties between now and 2030, so that it is clear 
that the carbon budgets will be met even if circumstances are different to central expectations.

Chapter 1: Economy-wide progress 29 

This includes changes in circumstances as the UK leaves the EU. Our assessment in 201610 was 
that over half of the emissions reduction required to meet the fifth carbon budget derives from 
policies agreed by the UK at the EU level. Carbon budgets must continue to be met after the UK 
has left the EU. New UK policies will therefore be needed to reduce emissions where policies 
previously agreed through the EU no longer apply or are weakened.

Source: Scenarios for CCC (2015) The Fifth Carbon Budget. 
Notes: The fifth carbon budget requires a 26% reduction in the UK's net carbon account from 2016 to 2030. 
However, this allows for trading in the EU ETS, where the UK is expected to be a net seller of allowances. On the 
basis of actual emissions the Committee scenarios involve a 36% reduction (equivalent to a 63% reduction from 
1990 to 2030), which is the level required to keep the UK on the lowest cost path to the 2050 target and to meet 
the fifth carbon budget taking account of possible trading of allowances within the EU ETS. Reduction in 
emissions from buildings is equivalent to a 20% reduction in CO2 and a 17% reduction if not including 
biomethane abatement (consistent with reporting in our 2015 Fifth Carbon Budget and 2016 Next Steps for UK 
Heat Policy reports).

(b) New policies required to close the policy gap 

Chapters 2-8 set out the full set of areas that need to be tackled in the Government's plans on a 
sector-by-sector basis. Action is required across the economy: 

• Low-carbon electricity generation. The Government should contract an additional 80-100
TWh of low-carbon electricity generation for the 2020s, beyond the auctions that have
already been funded and the new nuclear project planned at Hinkley Point C. They should
also put in place plans for further flexibility options (e.g. storage, interconnection, demand
response, and flexible generation).

• Carbon capture and storage (CCS). A new strategic approach is required to CCS
deployment in the UK, including a separate approach to development of transport and
storage infrastructure. Contracts should be awarded by 2020 to allow CCS to operate at scale
in the 2030s.

• New car and van CO2 standards. Stretching targets based on real-world testing are required
for new car and van CO2 standards beyond 2020 that take account of the need for high
uptake of electric vehicles. These standards are currently set at EU level and the UK should
either remain part of this legislation if it is sufficiently ambitious, or replicate this legislation
at a UK level.

• Heating. A clear, combined strategy for energy efficiency and low-carbon heat is needed. It
must significantly increase the delivery of energy efficiency measures, heat networks,

biomethane and heat pumps in cost-effective locations for both households and businesses. 
It should also test the possibility for low-carbon hydrogen to meet heat demand. 

• Industry and agriculture. Industry and agriculture both require new overall approaches to
long-term decarbonisation. In industry these need to turn the existing 'Roadmaps' into
specific actions and milestones. In agriculture new policies are required to deliver emissions
reduction beyond the current voluntary approach.

The Government must demonstrate that, as a whole, its plans would be sufficient to close the 
policy gap across a range of scenarios. We would expect the Government plans to include clear 
timelines for the development and implementation of any policies that remain at the proposal 
stage. They should also set out the intended approach to monitoring progress and adjusting 
policies as required to ensure progress remains on track. We will publish our assessment of the 
Government’s proposals subsequent to their publication. 

The Government should also make links between their plan to reduce emissions and the 
industrial strategy where relevant. This should include the wider benefits (e.g. for air quality, 
environmental protection, and employment) that would result from a successful low-carbon 
transition and industrial strategy. 

(c) Ensuring current policies deliver 

As well as following through on proposals for new policies to drive emissions reduction, the 
Government must ensure that existing policies deliver fully. Currently progress in this regard - 
summarised in Table 1.3 - is mixed. Good progress has been made in some areas (e.g. power) but 
underlying progress is already falling behind in many others (e.g. transport, buildings, industry, 
agriculture). 

Across the economy our assessment is that over three-quarters of current policy plans are at risk 
of under-delivery in future (Figure 1.6). Current risks and priorities for strengthening these 
policies include: 

• Power. Current progress is likely to be maintained until 2020. Existing plans and
commitments are expected to add a further 50 TWh of generation in the 2020s but there are
risks around these plans, particularly given that auctions have not yet completed and that
the contract for the new nuclear power plant allows a delivery date any time from 2025 to
2033. The Government should develop contingency plans for if major projects should fail to
deliver or be delayed.

• Transport. Current Government policies to tackle barriers to adoption of electric vehicles,
including financial support and roll-out of recharging infrastructure run out from 2018. They
should be extended. The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation should be increased to
deliver 8% of road fuels by energy by 2020, from the current level of 4.75% which is not
sufficient to deliver the emissions reduction required to meet carbon budgets.

• Buildings and industry. Policy strengthening is required across all areas, including to
improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings (e.g. to increase installation rates of
insulation) and to improve uptake of low-carbon heat (e.g. heat pumps, heat networks, and
biomethane).

• Agriculture and F-gases. In agriculture the voluntary approach to emissions reduction
should be strengthened to ensure the stated ambition is met. In F-gases the existing
approach agreed at the EU-level must be clarified and participation should either continue in




32 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

the EU scheme, or it should be replicated in the UK to deliver emissions reduction in-line with 
the full cost-effective opportunity available. 

• Waste. Further action is needed throughout the waste chain to reduce emissions, including
waste prevention, separate collections (e.g. of food waste), reducing the amount of
biodegradable waste sent to landfill (e.g. to zero by 2025), and to increase methane capture
at landfill.

3. Preparing for the 2050 target
The Climate Change Act requires that the Government’s plans for meeting carbon budgets are 
prepared with a view to meeting the 2050 target to reduce emissions by at least 80% from 1990 
to 2050. Effective plans must reduce emissions over the period of the carbon budgets and 
develop options to enable the further reductions of around 4% per year required from 2030 to 
2050. This will require a widespread shift to zero-carbon fuels.  

Some key options are already relatively mature and have an important role throughout the 
period to 2050. For example, energy efficiency and low-carbon power generation will be crucial 
sources of emissions reductions to 2030 and enablers of deeper change beyond that. 




Chapter 1: Economy-wide progress 33 

However, there are several areas that will need to develop significantly between now and 2030 if 
they are to make a major contribution to meeting the 2050 target: 

• Electric vehicles and low-carbon heating (e.g. heat pumps and heat networks) are
currently niche options that must grow market share over the next decade to enable roll-out
at scale over the 2030s and 2040s. The Government's plans to 2030 should set out clearly
how the UK will significantly increase uptake in these areas and prepare for a potential
complete shift across the vehicle and building stocks by 2050. Chapters 3 (Buildings) and 5
(Transport) set out the areas where public policy will need to support growth of these
markets.

• Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is vital for meeting the 2050 target and could contribute
to earlier carbon budgets. Our 2030 scenarios for the fifth carbon budget include
applications for power generation and at industrial installations. CCS is also an enabler of
low-carbon hydrogen production and removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. A
strategy for CCS deployment remains an urgent priority (Box 1.3). Without progress between
now and 2030, the fifth carbon budget will be harder to meet and CCS will not be able to
contribute fully to achieving the 2050 target.

• Hydrogen from low-carbon sources could have an important role in the decarbonisation of
residential and commercial heating, industry, transport and increasing the flexibility of
electricity generation. This would require Government leadership and co-ordination. Without
action now, it will not be possible to assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness prior to
deciding on the path for large-scale decarbonisation of heating and large vehicles. The
Committee will publish further analysis in 2018 on the opportunities and challenges of using
hydrogen as part of the transition to a low-carbon economy.

• Sustainable bioenergy is likely to play a crucial part in meeting the carbon budgets and
2050 target as a consequence of the current lack of options for replacing hydrocarbons in
sectors such as aviation and parts of industry. The Committee published a detailed review of
the role of sustainable bioenergy in 2011 and intends to update this in 2018, to cover
sustainability issues and the most appropriate use within a low-carbon strategy. The
Government released their bioenergy strategy in April 2012 on the most cost-effective use of
bioenergy for meeting decarbonisation targets. This included a stated intention to review
the consistency of current policies with this strategy, in at least five year intervals. This is now
overdue.

• Development of greenhouse gas removal and innovation in hard-to-treat sectors is
important not just for meeting the 2050 target but also the aim of the Paris Agreement to
balance sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. Hard-to-treat sectors include aviation,
agriculture and parts of industry, while greenhouse gas removal covers a range of options
such as afforestation, carbon-storing materials, bioenergy with carbon capture and direct air
capture and storage. We detailed the need for a UK strategy to cover these areas in our
report on the implications of the Paris Agreement11 and have defined new indicators to track
progress going forward (Box 1.4).

Analyses of the 2050 target suggest that the lowest cost ways of meeting it are likely to involve 
significant contributions from these options.12 The Government’s plans to 2030 must progress 
these areas.

34 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

Box 1.3 The need for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to meet the 2050 target 

In July 2016 the Committee wrote to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change to reiterate 
our previous advice that a failure to deploy CCS could double the cost of meeting the 2050 target.13 
This reflects the fact that CCS offers opportunities to reduce emissions where alternatives are limited.  

• CCS is the only option to enable continued production in some industrial sectors such as steel,
cement and chemicals with deeply reduced carbon emissions.

• CCS can provide a source of flexible “mid-merit” power generation when applied to gas-fired
power generation. Low-carbon flexible power is likely to be required alongside intermittent
renewables (i.e. wind and solar) and inflexible nuclear.

• CCS is currently expected to be the lowest cost production method for low-carbon hydrogen,
which is an important option to reduce emissions, particularly from heating, some parts of industry
and potentially transport, especially heavy goods vehicles.

• In combination with the use of bioenergy, CCS has the potential to remove carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere and permanently store it.

There is currently no Government strategy for deployment of CCS, following the cancellation of the 
CCS Commercialisation competition in November 2015. A new strategy should be published without 
delay, presenting viable options for CCS to operate at scale in the 2030s.  

• Capture contracts should be awarded by 2020. These should cover a mixture of industry
applications (where costs may be lowest), power (where risks of default are lower than for industry)
and potentially hydrogen production or use with bioenergy.

• The level of deployment must be sufficient to realise economies of scale and to engage the
financial community. Previous analysis14 suggests that, by 2035, there should be 4–7 GW installed
for power generation and 3–5 MtCO2 per year captured from industrial installations.

In 2016 the Parliamentary Advisory Group on CCS was asked by the Secretary of State for Business, 
Energy and Industrial Strategy to assess the potential contribution of CCS to cost-effective UK 
decarbonisation. This group includes cross-party and cross-industry expertise on delivery, financing 
and regulation of energy infrastructure. 

The Committee agree with the findings of this Group that an effective strategy can be lower cost than 
the previous approach, by suitably allocating risks between parties, and that this should move forward 
quickly over the next five years. Key proposals from the Advisory Group include: 

• A CCS Delivery Company to deliver full-chain CCS for power, including transportation and storage
infrastructure.

• A system of economic regulation for CCS in the UK, including a capacity contract to incentivise CCS
for power.

• An incentivisation scheme to remunerate industry for capture and storage of their CO2.

• An independent, cross-industry group to assess the relative costs and technical feasibility of heat
decarbonisation via electrification or hydrogen.

• A certification scheme for the safe, long-term storage of CO2.

• A scheme to oblige suppliers of fossil fuels to prove storage of an equivalent amount of CO2.

Box 1.4 New indicators for tracking UK development of greenhouse gas removal options 

Greenhouse gas removal (GGR) technologies are those that remove greenhouse gases from the air, 
rather than reduce emissions at source. We already include three such options in our scenarios for the 
cost-effective path to the 2050 target: afforestation, wood in construction and bioenergy with CCS. 
Nevertheless, there is a diverse range of other options at varying stages of technological development 
(such as direct air capture and storage, enhanced weathering and ocean liming). 

Current estimates suggest that there is not enough GGR potential to substitute for the widespread 
deployment of zero-emission technologies envisaged in our scenarios. Rather, these technologies are a 
complementary and necessary addition to achieve net zero emissions. 

We commissioned Ecofys to identify barriers to deployment of GGR options, develop a high-level path 
to overcome those barriers and recommend indicators that could be used to track UK progress. The 
project identified a range of barriers specific to each GGR option, but also important general barriers 
across all GGRs. These include: 

• Low (but rising) awareness and policy priority.

• Key knowledge gaps requiring research and innovation.

• Lack of a business case due to the value of removal being absent from relevant policies.

The current wide uncertainties around the feasibility and wider impacts of nearly all GGR options at 
scale mean that the best future mix is unclear. Near-term actions by Government should therefore 
ensure that the range of GGR options is available to participate fully in the UK’s climate strategy. 
Longer-term, they should be deployed according to their cost and wider impacts, compliance with 
other regulations and ability to sequester greenhouse gases reliably. 

To monitor progress in achieving this we plan to track the following indicators: 

• A UK strategy should be in place to develop GGR options, starting during the third carbon budget
period (2018-2022).

• Increased funding for research, development and demonstration should be available for GGR
options during the third and fourth carbon budget periods (covering priority areas such as total
potential, monitoring and verification, safety and wider impacts, and capture methods).

• A new Government bioenergy strategy should be published and implemented in the third carbon
budget period, to determine sustainable biomass criteria, stimulate domestic supply and reflect
the carbon values of different end uses.

• A market mechanism is needed to value removal on a comparable basis to emissions reduction
(e.g. in the EU ETS or any UK replacement). It should be introduced in the fourth carbon budget
period.

• A Government review is required, during the third carbon budget period, of ways to encourage
low-GHG and GHG-removing materials in construction (e.g. through building regulations). We note
that currently 22% of new houses are timber-framed in England, compared to 76% in Scotland.

In addition, when monitoring the replacement by 2020 for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), we 
will expect the new rules to link support more closely to both the reduction and removal of emissions 
in the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors (see Chapter 6).

4. International progress in tackling climate change
(a) Global emissions trends 

Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion have remained flat over the last two years 
(Figure 1.7) even as the global economy has grown: 15  
• The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports global emissions from fossil fuel combustion in

2016 were 32.1 billion tonnes of CO2 (GtCO2), at around the same level as in 2015 and 2014.
• Several factors have been identified as playing a role in emissions not growing. While the

global economy continued to grow, the pace of improvements in both energy efficiency and
the carbon intensity of energy generation picked up:
‒ Continued economic growth. Global GDP grew just over 3% per year during 2014-

2016,16 a similar rate to the average since 1990. Within this, the rate of GDP growth 
slowed in China while accelerating in the EU and other parts of the world.  

‒ Increased energy efficiency. Global energy use per unit of GDP has followed a 
decreasing trend since 2012. This has been through a combination of shifts in economic 
structure (particularly in China) and improvements to energy efficiency. 

‒ Reduced carbon intensity. Deployment of renewables has continued to increase, with 
2016 the third successive year they met over half the growth in electricity demand. Total 
coal demand also fell in 2016 due to factors including the advance of renewables, the US 
boom in shale gas production and Chinese policies for improving air quality.

Chapter 1: Economy-wide progress 37 

(b) International climate policy 

The Paris Agreement is now in effect, meaning there is a global framework in place aimed at 
reducing emissions around the world. However, the new administration of the United States has 
announced it will leave the Agreement, and current pledges are not enough to meet the 2°C and 
1.5°C limits for global temperature increase. 

The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Countries from around the world 
have pledged to take action to reduce their emissions: 

• After being ratified by over 55 parties to the UN climate process, covering over 55% of
emissions, the Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016.

• Under the Paris process all parties are required to submit pledges of action to reduce
emissions. To date 142 parties (including China, India, the EU and the previous US
administration) have done so.17

• The first meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement was held in Marrakech in December
2016. This group will need to agree aspects of delivering the Agreement, such as convening
the dialogue in 2018 to take stock of the pledges, improving consistency and transparency of
pledges, and setting the rules for a new market of emissions credits.

Current pledges are not enough in total to meet the goals of the Agreement: 

• The overarching aim of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in global temperature to
well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.

• To stay below 2°C, CO2 emissions will need to fall below zero (i.e. into net removals) by the
2050s-70s along with deep reductions of all other greenhouse gases. To stay close to 1.5°C,
CO2 emissions would need to reach net zero by the 2040s. If net removals cannot be
achieved, global CO2 emissions will need to reach zero sooner.18

• Projections of global emissions continue to show further increases out to 2030, although less
than forecast before the Paris Agreement. Compared to these projections, paths to meet the
Paris goals show emissions in 2030 lower by at least around 17 GtCO2e (30%).19

In the United States, the new administration has announced it will leave the Agreement, 
although several other countries, firms and sub-national governments have underlined their 
commitment in response: 

• The new US administration has made clear it plans to de-prioritise climate action at a federal
level. As well as relaxing regulations that restrict carbon emissions, it announced in May that
it would leave the Paris Agreement.

• Leaders in other countries, including China, India, the EU, Canada, Mexico and Australia, have
however reaffirmed their plans to continue with the Agreement since the US announcement.
Reaffirmation has also come from within the US, notably the US Climate Alliance of states
(covering about a fifth of all US emissions and two-fifths of US GDP), the US Climate Mayors
(covering over 200 cities) and several US firms.

Progress in developing national-level policies around the world means that the global transition 
towards a low-carbon economy is well under way:

38 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

• 142 countries have submitted pledges to reduce emissions under the Paris process. 125 have
also put in place their own domestic climate laws, including the UK Climate Change Act.20

• Nearly 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions are now covered by carbon pricing schemes,
up from 4% in 2008. This is due to increase further to around 22% by the end of 2017 as
China commences its national emissions trading scheme.21

Overall, developments in national policies mean global emissions in 2030 could be lower than 
expected from the pledges, but not yet by enough to bridge the gap to the Paris goals: 22 

• Analysis suggests intended changes to federal policy will increase US emissions in 2030 by
about 0.4 GtCO2e compared to previous policy.

• In contrast, emissions projections for China and India are coming down due to a combination
of lower demand expectations, new policies and switching away from coal towards wind and
solar power. In total these are projected to bring down expected emissions in 2030 by 2-3
GtCO2e compared to projections just one or two years ago.

The decline in UK emissions means that, on a per-person basis, the UK has almost converged to 
the global average (Figure 1.8): 

• Global emissions per person were 7.4 tCO2e in 1990, and are set to fall to just below 7 tCO2e
in 2030 if current national pledges of action are met. In contrast, UK emissions, measured as
territorial emissions plus a UK share of international aviation and shipping, have fallen from
14.4 tCO2e per person in 1990 to 7.7 tCO2e per year.

• The UK 2050 target was derived from the principle that it was hard to see a global deal
limiting warming to 2°C in which UK emissions per person would be above the global
average in the long term. Given the decline in UK emissions and sustained global emissions,
it appears this point may be reached by 2020.

• The average level of emissions per person in 2050 consistent with a 2°C pathway is around 2
tCO2e or less. This underlines the need to achieve continued reductions in UK emissions and
a step change in global reductions.

Although the UK is a richer nation with relatively high levels of consumption, this is not entirely 
reflected in the UK’s emissions since the UK tends to import manufactured goods and export 
services. When measured on a consumption basis (i.e. including emissions embedded in imports 
and excluding exports) UK emissions are much higher and well above the global average. For 
instance, in 2013 (the most recent available data) they were over 16 tCO2e per person.23 A 
combination of UK and global action, as envisaged in the Paris Agreement, is required to cut 
these emissions.

Notes: All paths to 1.5°C and 2°C assume further reductions to net zero emissions or below by 2100. The range for 
1.5°C pathways consists of fewer model runs than for 2°C, which is why some of the range for 2°C includes lower 
emissions before 2040. Individual models consistently show swifter reductions to meet 1.5°C than to meet 2°C.

Key messages and recommendations 

In this chapter we report on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electricity generation and progress in 
reducing emissions and preparing for future reductions. We also set out our recommendations and 
priorities for the Government's plans for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets.  

Our key messages for the power sector are: 

• There was strong progress in reducing power sector emissions in 2016, continuing the trend
since 2012. Emissions fell 24% in 2016 and are now 55% below 2008 levels, and 62% below 1990.
The share of generation from low-carbon sources has increased to 45% (up from 20% in 2008),
while coal's share has fallen to 10% (down from a recent peak of 42% in 2012). Emissions intensity
is now 286 gCO2/kWh, having been over 500 gCO2/kWh as recently as 2012.

• Progress is set to continue, albeit more slowly, to 2021. Continued roll-out of renewables,
driven by Government policies, should increase the low-carbon share of generation to around 55%
in 2020. The emissions intensity of the power sector would then reach 200-250 gCO2/kWh
depending on how quickly the remaining coal exits the system.

• Significant risks remain beyond 2020:

‒ The final investment decision taken for Hinkley Point C, and Government plans for 
Contract-for-Difference auctions would support around a further 50 TWh of low-carbon 
generation in the 2020s. However, around 130-150 TWh is needed in total to replace 
retiring plants and reach a system emissions intensity of below 100 gCO2/kWh in 2030, 
which is part of the lowest cost path to meet the UK's carbon commitments. 

‒ There is currently no strategy for the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), 
which is crucial to meeting the 2050 target at least cost and for which deployment in the 
power sector is likely to be a key enabler of wider roll-out. 

‒ The electricity system must become significantly more flexible by 2030. That reflects the 
challenges of managing a more variable supply as renewable generation increases and as 
conventional thermal plant retires. It also reflects the opportunity offered by new 
technologies: smart appliances and energy-management systems in homes and businesses 
and the falling cost of batteries and other storage. Increasing flexibility will require policy 
and regulatory action to ensure barriers to entry for flexibility providers are removed.  

• Key priorities for the Government's policies and proposals to meet the fifth carbon budget
therefore include:

‒ A new strategic approach to CCS. This will require a programme of CCS deployment across 
power and industry, alongside a separate approach to CO2 capture and to the transport 
and storage infrastructure. 

‒ Continuing auctions to allocate long-term contracts for subsidy-free low-carbon 
generation, which together with CCS and any negotiated contracts should deliver a further 
80-100 TWh of low-carbon generation in the 2020s beyond the auctions that are already 
planned and the nuclear project at Hinkley Point C.  

‒ Policy and regulatory changes to ensure that flexibility options are rewarded in the energy 
markets in a way that reflects the value they bring to the system. 

We will assess the Government's plan for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets against the 
following checklist (Table 2.1).

Introduction 
In this chapter we review progress in decarbonising the UK power sector in 2016. We outline 
priorities for taking forward the policy framework to ensure that we build on this progress and 
meet future carbon budgets. We also report on new work that the Committee has undertaken in 
the last year to look at the flexibility requirements of a low-carbon power sector and to identify 
regulatory and other changes required to deliver those at least cost. 

We summarise the analysis that underpins our key messages and recommendations in the 
following four sections: 

1. The power sector

2. Recent progress in reducing emissions in the power sector compared to required progress

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets

4. Delivering system flexibility

1. The power sector
Power sector CO2 emissions (21% of total UK CO2 emissions, Figure 2.1) reduced by 25 MtCO2 
(24%) between 2015 and 2016 to 78 MtCO224, having fallen around 16% per year in the two 
previous years. Emissions in the power sector are now down 55% from their 2008 levels and 
down 62% from 1990 (Figure 2.2).

Emissions trends and drivers 

Recent reductions in emissions have been due to a decrease in the emissions intensity of the 
power sector, to 286 gCO2/kWh in 2016. This reflected a shift from coal to gas generation in 
2016, while over the last few years it reflects an increasing amount of renewable electricity 
alongside energy efficiency improvements and growing imports: 

• In 2016, emissions fell as generation shifted from coal to gas driven by UK carbon prices and
fossil fuel prices that favoured gas generation.

‒ The UK applies a tax on CO2 emissions from power generation on top of the price paid
through the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). While the carbon price in the ETS was 
broadly stable at around €5/tCO2, the UK's Carbon Price Support increased from £9/tCO2 
to £18/tCO2 in April 2015. This favoured a shift away from coal as its carbon emissions are 
roughly double those of gas, per unit of generation. 

‒ Fuel prices also favoured gas over coal in the last year: average gas prices fell 19% 
between 2015 and 2016, whilst coal prices increased 16%. 

‒ As a result, average load factors for coal plants declined to 17% in 2016 (29 TWh, 10% of 
UK generation), from 42% (72 TWh) in 2015 and 52% (95 TWh) in 2014. This, alongside

Chapter 2: Power 45 

European environmental standards and the UK Government's commitment to close all 
UK coal plant by 2025, reduced prospects for UK coal power and led to the closure of 4.2 
GW of coal capacity25 in 2016. 

‒ The reduction in coal generation in 2016 was compensated for by an increase in gas 
generation, which saw plant load factors increase from 25% in 2015 (87 TWh) to 43% in 
2016 (129 TWh, 43% of generation).  

‒ Electricity demand and generation from renewables and nuclear remained roughly 
constant from 2015 to 2016. Renewable output fell slightly despite an increase in 
installed capacity due to an average 11% reduction in wind speeds compared to 2015.26 
Overall output from renewable generation has increased 250% since 2008 (from 21 TWh 
in 2008 to 75 TWh in 2016). 

• Since 2008, gas generation is also down and the share of demand met by fossil fuels has
fallen as renewable generation has expanded, demand has reduced and imports have
increased.

‒ The share of electricity generated from fossil fuels has decreased from 80% to 53%
between 2008 and 2016 as renewable generation has expanded from 6% to 25% of total 
generation. Electricity generated from existing nuclear power plants has remained fairly 
constant across this period, at around 60 TWh per annum (22% of generation).  

‒ Total electricity consumption has decreased around 12% since 2008; total residential 
electricity use decreased by 9% over the same period, whereas electricity consumption 
per household decreased by 17%. In 2016, households accounted for 36% of electricity 
consumption, with the remainder being used in the public and commercial sectors (34%) 
and industrial processes (30%) (Figure 2.2).  

‒ Imported electricity to the UK has increased from an annual average of 7 TWh during 
2008-2012 to 18 TWh (6% of generation) over 2013-2016. Had this electricity instead 
been provided by UK gas generation then the emissions intensity of the UK power sector 
in 2016 would have been 292 gCO2/kWh (Box 2.1). 

The deep emissions reductions in the UK were not replicated elsewhere in Europe, where carbon 
prices were not topped up as much beyond the low EU ETS price. The total reduction in EU ETS 
emissions from all other countries in 2016 was about the same as in the UK alone.  

UK power sector emissions reductions of recent years (i.e. 80 MtCO2, 55%, since 2012) cannot be 
sustained into future years solely through coal to gas switching. Complete closure of the UK's 
remaining coal fleet and replacement by gas generation would only cut emissions by around 16 
MtCO2 while a reduction of around 46 MtCO2 to 2030 is needed.  

25 Coal power stations at Longannet, Ferrybridge and Rugeley all closed. 
26 2015 wind speeds were 5% above the 10-year mean, 2016 was 7% below. Sun hours were also 3% less than 2015, 
leading to a 1.5% reduction in solar load factors.  




46 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

Box 2.1. The treatment of imported electricity in UK carbon budgets 

Emissions from imported electricity occur outside the UK and therefore do not count towards the limit 
on emissions set in the carbon budgets. They are accounted for in exporting countries, and are covered 
by the EU ETS.  

We estimate actual emissions intensity of the power sector based on UK emissions and UK generation. 
Both these input figures would be higher if imports were lower: if UK gas generation replaced the 18 
TWh of imports in 2016, then UK emissions would have been 7 MtCO2 higher, and emissions intensity 
would have been 292 gCO2/kWh instead of 286 gCO2/kWh. 

In the longer term, the UK should not rely on imported electricity to cut UK emissions unless it is clear 
that imports are from low-carbon sources and the UK can rely on their continued supply: 

• The UK currently imports electricity as over the course of the year it has had higher wholesale
electricity prices more often than connected markets. However, future relative prices in the UK and
connected markets are hard to predict. Increasing penetration of low marginal cost low-carbon
generation could depress wholesale prices in the UK, while the potential for connected markets to
impose their own top-ups to the EU ETS carbon price could increase prices elsewhere. If changing
market dynamics mean that the UK does not import electricity in future, then UK sources of low-
carbon generation will be needed to maintain security of supply and meet carbon budgets.

• It may be possible to connect to other markets and import surplus low-carbon generation, such as
Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) from North Africa or geothermal power from Iceland. These
options are not yet well developed and involve a number of challenges, but the UK has expressed
an interest in exploring them and in principle they could provide a reliable cost-effective source of
low-carbon power.

When we build scenarios for development of the UK power sector consistent with UK carbon 
commitments we assume that by 2030 the UK is neither a net importer nor a net exporter of electricity. 
If the UK is able to reliably import low-carbon power then less UK-based low-carbon capacity would be 
required.  

When we monitor underlying progress by estimating achievable emissions intensity (section 2) we 
calculate what would be achievable with zero net imports. 

Even with net imports of zero, interconnection can be valuable in increasing system flexibility (section 
4). Security of supply and operating efficiency can be improved through sharing of back-up capacity 
and provision of ancillary services. Intermittent and renewable generation can be better 
accommodated and better take advantage of geographical diversity of renewable output and demand 
profiles. 

Progress indicators 

We monitor progress based on a set of indicators that reflect underlying progress in the sector 
and a possible set of actions that would deliver on the legislated carbon budgets and prepare for 
the 2050 target. Our progress indicators for the power sector (Figure 2.3) cover the expansion of 
low-carbon generation and the successful integration of low-carbon sources into the electricity 
system. To reduce emissions further from the power sector requires a continued expansion of 
low-carbon generation, which should increase from 45% of generation in 2016 to around 75% in 
2030 (Figure 2.4): 

• Low-carbon generation. On top of the 130 TWh of low-carbon generation we expect to be
online in 2020 (and remain online in 2030) an additional 130-150 TWh of low-carbon
generation should be added in the 2020s. Given expected retirements, particularly of




Chapter 2: Power 47 

existing nuclear capacity, that would bring total low-carbon generation to around 260-280 
TWh. Allowing for an increase in demand as electric vehicles and heat pumps are deployed 
in-line with our scenarios (see Transport and Buildings chapters), this would leave around 
100 TWh of generation required from gas-fired plants, implying an emissions intensity in 
2030 of around 100 gCO2/kWh. 

• Carbon capture and storage (CCS). Alongside renewables and nuclear we would expect
some of the new low-carbon generation to come from plants fitted with carbon capture and
storage. CCS technology is important to meeting the UK's 2050 emissions target at least cost
and the power sector is an important element in a credible strategy for developing a UK CCS
infrastructure27.

• Flexibility. The UK's electricity system will also have to become more flexible in order to
accommodate more variable and inflexible generation and changing demand patterns that
will arise as new technology is installed in homes and businesses. We consider the shift to a
more flexible electricity system in section 4 and set out a new set of indicators for monitoring
progress in these areas.

• Policy. As well as tracking low-carbon generation we track the investments that will lead to
increased generation and the policies that will support those investments.

The next section sets out progress towards these indicators in 2016. Section 3 sets out what is 
required from policy to keep progress on track. Section 4 presents new indicators on flexibility 
following new analysis by the Committee this year.

Note: The rate of increase in share of low-carbon generation in the CCC's scenarios is comparable to the rate of 
increase in low-carbon generation since 2008. Variability in projected generation in the CCC's scenarios reflects 
uncertainty over retirement dates of existing coal and nuclear generation in BEIS's Energy and Emissions 
Projections scenarios.  

2. Recent progress in reducing emissions in the power sector compared
to required progress 

Progress towards CCC indicators 

Planned projects continued to be rolled out in 2016 and the potential pipeline of new projects 
increased: 

• 1.4 GW of onshore wind and 2.4 GW of solar commissioned in 2016 (Table 2.2). No offshore
wind plant completed construction in 2016 - this in part reflects the 'lumpiness' of these
large investments, with 5.6 GW of projects still expected to deploy by 2021.

• In early 2016, EdF announced plant life extensions to 3.6 GW of the UK's 9 GW nuclear fleet
that it operates. This low-carbon generation will now continue into the 2020s. However, 8
GW of the existing capacity is still set to come offline by the end of the fifth carbon budget
period.

• New low-carbon projects continued to move through the project development pipeline in
2016:

‒ 3.3 GW of projects commenced construction (including 1.7 GW of offshore wind and 1
GW of onshore wind). Of the 2.9 GW of onshore wind projects currently awaiting

construction, 2.2 GW are in Scotland, with 0.3 GW in both Wales and Northern Ireland, 
and 0.1 GW in England.  

‒ 3.6 GW of renewables received planning approval, including 1.8 GW of offshore wind, 0.8 
GW of onshore wind and 0.7 GW of solar PV. This leaves a pipeline of 18.7 GW of 
renewables capacity across the UK.  

‒ 1.2 GW submitted planning applications (0.8 GW was new onshore wind, representing a 
slowdown on 2014 and 2015, when 1.7 GW and 2.5 GW of projects entered the planning 
system respectively). 

This continued good progress has led us to increase our assessment from our 2016 Progress 
Report to Parliament for renewable generation expected by 2020. We now expect this to reach 
around 37% of overall expected generation, or 130 TWh (Table 2.2):   

• Existing capacity would be expected to generate around 87 TWh in a typical year (it
generated 75 TWh in 2016 despite unfavourable wind conditions).

• Contracts have been signed for an expected 30 TWh of low-carbon generation to come
online by 2021.

• We expect around 12 TWh of further generation to come online by 2020 under Feed-in-
Tariffs (FiTs) and the Renewables Obligation (RO) despite closures of those schemes.

‒ Following cuts of around 65% to small-scale FiT rates in January 2016, annual
deployment of solar PV under the scheme has dropped by around 90% per annum, 
meaning that just 0.1 GW of capacity was deployed under FiTs in 2016, compared to 0.8 
GW in the previous year. We expect an increase in FiT generation of around 1 TWh to 
2020. 

‒ The RO closed to solar PV and onshore wind in April 2016, though around 2.5 GW of 
onshore wind projects have 'grace periods' which allow them to commission by April 
2018 (1.7 GW of which is in Scotland, alongside 0.4 GW in Wales, 0.3 GW in Northern 
Ireland and less than 0.1 GW in England). Similarly we expect 1.3 GW of offshore wind to 
commission under the RO. Together these would generate around 11 TWh in a typical 
year. 

• In our 2016 Progress Report we expected 115 TWh of renewable generation to come online
by 2020 under FiTs, the RO and CfDs. Given additional projects coming forward under the
RO, we now expect 130 TWh of renewable generation to be online in 2020/21.

Broader upgrades to the UK electricity system will help to accommodate this increase in low-
carbon generation. 

• A major upgrade to the UK transmission system is expected in 2017, when the 2.2 GW
Western HVDC link between Scotland and England is completed. This will enable more low-
carbon capacity to be deployed in Scotland and is expected to reduce payments to Scottish
generators for curtailing their generation at times of system stress.

• Approximately 6m smart meters were installed by March 2017 as part of a Government
mandated programme, aiming to install a smart electricity and gas meter in every home (and
2m small businesses) by the end of 2020. This is behind the original expected deployment
trajectory.28

50 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

Of the 24 GW of coal and nuclear capacity on the system at the end of 2016, 23 GW is set to retire 
by the end of the fifth carbon budget period. This capacity generated around 95 TWh in 2016, 
and, if running at maximum load factors, would be capable of producing around 180 TWh of 
generation per year. Older gas capacity may also retire, depending on market conditions, leaving 
a generation gap which should be replaced by low-carbon power.   

After 2020, investment prospects remain unclear, albeit with some progress in the last year: 

• The Government has announced its intention to hold up to three 'Pot 2' auctions by 20202930

for offshore wind and other less mature renewable technologies. Depending on the clearing
prices for the auctions, these could support around 25 TWh of new low-carbon generation to
be deployed from 2021 to 2026.

• EdF have signed the contract offered by the UK Government and taken a final investment
decision to proceed with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant. The plant is aiming to
commission in 2025 and is expected to generate around 25 TWh per year.

• There was mixed progress in developing other new large-scale nuclear projects in the UK,
and the Government is yet to confirm the winner of its Small Modular Reactor (SMR)
competition.

‒ Although the AP 1000 reactor planned for NuGen's Moorside project passed the
regulator's Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process in early 2017, the future of the 
project is currently uncertain following the bankruptcy of Westinghouse. Horizon's Wylfa 
project continues to make progress, with completion of its GDA expected in December 
2017. China General Nuclear gained ownership of the Bradwell nuclear site and 
submitted its GDA application in January 2017. 

‒ In March 2016 the Government launched a Small Modular Reactor competition, with the 
intention of providing £250m of funding over the next five years to the best value SMR 
design for the UK, alongside an SMR roadmap for the UK. To date, no further details have 
emerged.  

• The independent Hendry Review recommended that the Government proceed with the
Swansea Bay tidal lagoon as a 'pathfinder' project, but no contract has yet been offered. If
built Swansea would generate around 0.5 TWh per year, while a programme that also
included Cardiff Bay and Newport could be delivered in the 2020s and generate 8 TWh a year
(around 3% of current UK generation)31.

There has been no progress in bringing forward policy for mature renewables (e.g. onshore wind 
and solar) or for CCS. That is despite record low prices being set for renewables in European 
auctions and despite further advice emphasising the importance of CCS from the Committee32 
and from the Parliamentary Advisory Group. 

Section 3 considers what is needed to improve prospects for investment in the 2020s. 

29 Under the Energy Act (2013) the Government introduced long-term contracts for low-carbon power generation, 
known as ‘Contracts for difference’ (CfDs), which allow low-carbon generators to recoup their investment costs 
through fixed prices for electricity generation. These contracts can be won via competitive auctions split between 
three auction pots: Pot 1: onshore wind, large-scale solar PV; Pot 2: offshore wind, tidal stream, wave, "Advanced 
Conversion Technologies", and Biomass Combined Heat and Power (CHP); Pot 3: Biomass conversion. The 
Government recently consulted on including Scottish Island onshore wind in Pot 2.

Achievable emissions intensity 

In order to identify underlying progress we also track the Achievable Emissions Intensity of the 
power system (Figure 2.5): the emissions intensity of the grid if it were operated to minimise 
emissions by dispatching least-emitting plant first (i.e. renewables and nuclear, followed by gas 
and finally coal). Achievable intensity improved by 10% to 224 gCO2/kWh in 2016 due to 
increased deployment of onshore wind and solar capacity. This represents a slowdown 
compared to 2015 where the achievable intensity improved by 15%, reflecting that no offshore 
wind was commissioned in 2016.  

There is sufficient low-carbon capacity to meet over half of electricity demand in a typical year, 
and sufficient gas capacity to meet the remainder. Additional capacity may be required in a 
backup role, to ensure system security. We expect the gap between actual and achievable 
emissions intensity to continue to narrow, as coal comes off the system.

(provisional). 
Notes: Achievable emissions intensity (AEI) is the minimum average emissions intensity that could be achieved in 
a year, given the installed capacity, electricity demand and the profile of demand. Emissions intensity is based on 
UK useable generation, i.e. excluding losses, and imports. This is indicative of the carbon intensity of consuming a 
unit of electricity in the UK. Imported electricity reduces actual UK generation and the corresponding emissions 
intensity, but has no effect on achievable emissions intensity. In 2015 we updated the AEI methodology to 
include lifecycle emissions of 200 gCO2/kWh for biomass. 2016 data are provisional.

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
Effective policy in the power sector should allow for steady deployment of low-carbon 
technologies, where these are low cost over their lifetimes compared to gas generation facing a 
rising carbon price, or where they are required to drive down the costs of important options for 
the longer-term, such as offshore wind and carbon capture and storage. That implies moving 
steadily towards a power system with emissions of below 100 gCO2/kWh by 2030. 

In this section we evaluate the set of current and planned policies, assessing the risk that these 
policies might fail to deliver the necessary reductions in emissions. We then assess the "policy 
gap", where the set of current and planned policies are not sufficient to meet the cost-effective 
path through the recommended fifth carbon budget (to 2032). 

Current policy 

Last year we identified significant risks to sustained progress, particularly beyond 2020 and 
made several recommendations to address these. Several of these have made no progress, 
notably CCS and developing an approach to contract for the cheapest low-carbon generation. 
Early steps have been taken on improving system flexibility and contingency plans, while 
offshore wind auctions for the 2020s have begun following allocation of funding in the 2016 
fiscal Budget. We would expect all of these issues to move forward in the forthcoming plan for 
meeting the fifth carbon budget. 

Existing policies could deliver around 50 TWh of the 130-150 TWh of additional low-carbon 
generation that we identify as being appropriate to deploy in the 2020s:  

• The Hinkley Point C nuclear power project was originally offered a contract by the
Government in 2013. A review of the contract concluded in September 2016, reaffirming the
Government's commitment to the project. EdF, the company developing the project, aims to
commission the project by 2025. It is expected to provide around 25 TWh of low-carbon
power once fully operational. Should the project suffer serious delays, and not commission
by 2033, its contract would be terminated.

• In Budget 2016 the Government allocated funding of £730m per annum for 'Pot 2'
technologies (i.e. offshore wind and other less mature technologies), commissioning
between 2021 and 2026. 'Up to three' auctions are planned by 2020 to allocate this funding.
We expect the first of these auctions - which is currently underway - to contract 4-6 TWh of
generation, if contracted at the auction's reserve prices. Given potential for lower prices than
the reserve prices and for further contracts in subsequent rounds we expect around 25 TWh
could be contracted in total. As these projects are expected to mark an important milestone
in offshore wind cost reductions, and provide a strong contribution to power sector
decarbonisation in the 2020s, it is important that the Government stick to the planned
timetable and funding allocation for these auctions.

Despite a Parliamentary report on the necessary next steps to develop CCS in the UK and a 
Government-backed review of tidal lagoons, limited proposals exist to secure the additional 80-
100 TWh of low-carbon generation required, such as allowing for a route-to-market for mature 
low-carbon generation options:  

• A report from the Parliamentary Advisory Group on CCS (chaired by Lord Oxburgh) in
September 2016 reiterated the Committee's conclusions on the next steps for CCS
deployment in the UK. CCS deployment in the power sector could make a significant




54 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

contribution in terms of low-carbon power generation, whilst supporting development of a 
cost-effective transport and storage infrastructure to be used for CCS deployment in other 
sectors (Chapter 1).  

• The Hendry review of tidal lagoons concluded in January 2017, backing Government support
for a pathfinder tidal lagoon project at Swansea Bay in Wales, to test the potential long-term
contribution of this technology to the UK's energy mix. The Government has not yet
responded to the review.

• Although the Government confirmed it was working on a 'market-stabilising' contract for
difference in February 2016, no further progress was made towards allocating contracts for
mature low-carbon generation options such as onshore wind and solar PV from 2020, or
offshore wind from 2026. That is despite a growing body of evidence to suggest that, with a
suitable contract, these technologies could provide the lowest cost power of any options
(including gas-fired generation).

• There is potential for repowering of existing wind and solar sites that are expected to come
to the end of their lives under the RO in the second half of the 2020s. These sites may have
the potential to produce more energy if repowered with larger turbines, but the treatment of
repowering in future power markets is unclear.

As well as expanding low-carbon capacity, the flexibility of the system will need to improve. BEIS 
and Ofgem jointly launched a call for evidence on improving the flexibility of the power system 
in November 2016.33 That publication recognised many of the current barriers to efficiently 
improving system flexibility, but these have not yet been sufficiently addressed. We consider 
these issues further in section 4.  

The vote to leave the European Union has potentially important impacts for the power sector. 
Most notably there are questions over the future of emissions trading, and the regulatory 
arrangements for nuclear power (both existing and new build), given that much of the 
regulatory oversight is from Euratom at the EU level. There is also uncertainty about the UK's 
membership of the Single Energy Market and therefore the role of interconnection. 

Our assessments of existing policies against the options included in our scenarios for meeting 
the carbon budgets are set out in Table 2.3. The resulting policy gap, in terms of emissions and 
generation is set out in Figures 2.6 and 2.7.

Required progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets 

In order to meet the requirements of the Climate Change Act and to close this policy gap, the 
shortcomings in existing policy set out above must be addressed in the Government's proposals: 

• A new strategic approach to CCS (chapter 1). This would require a programme of CCS
deployment across power and industry, alongside a separate approach to CO2 capture and to
the transport and storage infrastructure.

• The Government must extend its approach to contracting low-carbon generation, to
the 80-100 TWh of additional generation in the 2020s required. An approach to
contracting mature low-carbon generation, together with CCS and any negotiated contracts,
should deliver a further 80-100 TWh of low-carbon generation in the 2020s beyond the
planned 'Pot 2' auctions and the nuclear project at Hinkley Point C.

‒ A programme of regular CfD contracting is required as a pragmatic and cost-effective
approach to delivering the low-carbon generation required to replace retiring generation 
and keep the UK on track to a system emissions intensity of below 100 gCO2/kWh in 2030, 
which is part of the lowest cost path to meet the UK's carbon commitments. A 
commitment to regular contracting, subject to cost, can provide investors with the 
confidence that there will be a market for low-carbon generation in the 2020s, whilst 
keeping costs to bill payers to a minimum (Box 2.2). 

‒ Latest estimates from BEIS and others34 suggest onshore wind and solar PV are already 
cheaper than fossil-fired generation. We expect offshore wind to be cost-competitive 
with fossil fuel generators facing a rising carbon price, later in the 2020s. These projects 
could be brought forward by auctions with low reserve prices that imply no net subsidy 
over their lifetimes, including when allowing for the system costs imposed by 
intermittent generation. Even though no subsidy is required, the CfD mechanism remains 
important given its effect in reducing the cost of capital for projects. 

‒ While auctions have proven effective in driving down costs, they could be supplemented 
by negotiated contracts for projects not well suited to auctions (e.g. because there are 
few potential bidders and they require different terms to wind projects), if they can be 
agreed at attractive strike prices. This is the current approach for new nuclear projects, 
tidal lagoons and CCS plants. 

‒ Carbon pricing is likely to continue having an important role alongside long-term 
contracts. In the Spring Budget 2017, the Government stated its intention to target a 
'total carbon price' for fossil fuel generators operating in the UK power sector from 
2021/22. That could help provide clarity over future plans while the UK's future 
membership of the EU Emissions Trading System remains uncertain following the vote to 
leave the European Union. 

• Contingency plans for delay or cancellation of planned projects, for example of new
nuclear power plants. The Government's plan to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
needs to demonstrate multiple plausible routes to keep the power sector on track to 2030
(i.e. towards a 100 gCO2/kWh intensity of generation), and towards a fully decarbonised
electricity system by 2050. If existing projects were delayed or cancelled this would require
alternative low-carbon technologies to increase their contribution. Options include tidal

lagoons or barrages, further offshore wind, other renewables (to the extent these are locally 
acceptable, sustainable and can be accommodated on the system), CCS, small modular 
nuclear reactors and low-carbon generation sourced from connected markets.  

• Policy and regulatory changes to ensure that flexibility options are rewarded in the
energy markets in a way that reflects the value they bring to the system. The
Government and Ofgem must follow through on the intentions set out in the Call for
Evidence and address the challenges set out in section 4 below.

Taken together, the new plans should put the UK electricity sector on track to an emissions 
intensity below 100 gCO2/kWh in 2030 across multiple scenarios, should see CCS deployed at 
scale during the 2020s and should ensure that flexibility options are able to capture their full 
value to the electricity system. 

In our March 2017 report on Energy Prices and Bills we estimated that meeting the fifth carbon 
budget will add around a further £85-120 to the annual household energy bill (£95 in our central 
estimate). Added to the current impact on bills (or around £105), this implies that low-carbon 
policies will add £190-225 in total to the average annual bill in 2030 (£200 in our central 
estimate). As well as the costs of sourcing 75% of UK generation from low-carbon sources by 
2030, this includes the system costs of integrating that generation, the costs of supporting 
residential energy efficiency improvements and the higher per unit costs of maintaining the gas 
grid as households cut demand and shift to low-carbon heating. 

Households could more than offset this bill impact through energy efficiency improvements 
between 2016 and 2030, which would save around £150 on average if prices remain at current 
levels. The majority (85%) of this saving is available from replacing appliances, lights and boilers 
at the end of their lives with the latest equivalent models. To date, energy efficiency savings 
have more than offset increases to household bills from the costs of supporting renewables. A 
typical household bill in 2016 was lower in real terms than it was in 2008 when the Climate 
Change Act was passed, despite rising wholesale gas prices over this period. 

Meeting the fifth carbon budget offers multiple opportunities for UK businesses. The 
Government's recent consultation on the industrial strategy noted the scale of industrial 
opportunities for offshore wind and nuclear power, and the importance of realising further cost 
reductions in offshore wind technology. Furthermore, it recognised the importance of 
improving the flexibility of the UK's electricity system (section 4) through innovation funding to 
support energy storage and Demand Side Response (DSR) technologies, and by improving the 
efficiency of electricity networks in a low-carbon energy system. 

The industrial strategy also announced a review of energy costs, set in the context of the need to 
meet the targets in the Climate Change Act. There are various elements of energy pricing that 
could be reviewed whilst still delivering an additional 80-100 TWh of low-carbon generation in 
the 2020s. That includes consideration of wholesale and network costs for businesses. These 
appear to result in higher industrial electricity prices in the UK than elsewhere in Europe, but the 
reasons - which are not a result of climate policies - are not clear.  

We will publish our assessment of the Government’s proposals for meeting the fifth carbon 
budget subsequent to their publication.  




Chapter 2: Power 59 

Box 2.2. Beyond the Levy Control Framework (LCF) 

The Levy Control Framework (LCF) sets a cap on the amount of support paid to low-carbon generators. 
In the past this has also served as a signal of how many contracts will be available in total for new low-
carbon generators. However, the Committee have previously identified that the LCF is not a good 
measure of subsidy as it is partly calculated as a top up against the wholesale electricity price, which is 
lower than the cost of alternative generating options. It would also be a poor signal of contract 
availability in the 2020s, when the support for existing projects (and therefore the remaining support 
for new projects) would vary considerably as the wholesale price varies. 
The Spring Budget 2017 announced that the LCF would not continue beyond 2020/21. It is due to be 
replaced by a new set of controls later this year. Details have not been confirmed, but some new 
controls and spending have been agreed: 

• The total annual support available for the planned 'Pot 2' auctions for 2021-2026 (which include
offshore wind) has been capped at £730 million (2012 prices). Depending on how low the winning
bids are, this could procure around 25 TWh of generation.

• The contract for the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C has a strike price of £92.50 in
2012 prices. For its expected output of 25 TWh and compared to a projected wholesale price of
£53/MWh that implies annual support payments of around £1 billion in 2030.

These commitments give certainty to investors that allow development to continue, whilst having an 
impact for consumers that can be identified. A similar approach, focused on controls for new contracts 
could continue these benefits: 

• In setting out its plans for the fourth and fifth carbon budgets, the Government should set out its
intention to contract a further 80-100 TWh of low-carbon generation in the 2020s.

• Some of this generation should come from CCS, for which the Government must set out its new
approach to delivery and to funding. Our analysis suggests 27 TWh per year of CCS generation
could be secured with support of around £1.4 billion above the wholesale price in 2030.

• For mature technologies that require long-term contracts, but not subsidies (e.g. onshore wind,
solar, possibly offshore wind from around 2025), the Government could set out the TWh it intends
to contract for each year (or delivery window of several years) and the maximum ('subsidy-free')
price at which contracts will be awarded.

• The Government may also choose to negotiate specific contracts for known amounts of power at
agreed prices or to run further auctions with fixed budgets for less-mature options.

• The Government should continue to work with the industry to ensure the policy environment is
supportive of cost reduction (e.g. in finalising the auction rules).

• The amount of planned contracting could be updated over time as circumstances evolve (e.g.
demand, plant retirements and extensions, cost of alternatives). The total expected impact on
consumers could be calculated in advance. To the extent that gas or carbon prices end up lower
than expected, support costs would be higher, but consumer's bills would be lower. If gas or
carbon prices are higher, then support costs would be lower.

We expect the generation required in our power scenarios in the 2020s to require around £4bn per 
annum by 2030 above the wholesale price, in addition to what has already been contracted. This is not 
a measure of subsidy, since the assumed wholesale price (£53/MWh) is lower than the expected new 
build cost of gas generation (£73/MWh). Under the scenarios from our advice on the fifth carbon 
budget and latest cost assumptions, the new generation in the 2020s could be secured at an average 
cost per unit of generation that is 21% below the cost of contracts to date.

4. Delivering system flexibility

(a) Context
A functioning electricity system must balance generation and consumption to provide a high 
quality of service, and remain stable by maintaining the system frequency within narrow limits. 
This will increasingly require flexibility, where generators and consumers increase or decrease 
output or consumption, for example in response to changes in output from the increasing share 
of renewable generation. Flexibility is also required as the location of generation changes, as 
conventional thermal power plants retire and as energy consumption patterns change as new 
energy-management technologies are placed in businesses and homes. The electricity System 
Operator (National Grid) currently arranges a number of services to secure these changes in 
output or consumption (Box 2.3).  

Box 2.3. Flexibility services in the electricity system 

A number of services exist to ensure the electricity system is managed securely and effectively: 

• Wholesale energy (arranged up to one hour ahead).

• Balancing (arranged half an hour ahead).

• Reserve (arranged 10-20 minutes ahead). Addresses unexpected reduction in generation or
increase in consumption, to maintain system reliability.

• Frequency response (arranged 1-30 seconds ahead). Addresses sudden loss of generation (e.g.
failure of large generator or interconnector) or increase in consumption, in order to keep system
frequency within statutory limits.

• System inertia (provided instantaneously and automatically). Provided by stored kinetic energy of
the rotating mass of a thermal generator’s turbines. A high degree of system inertia reduces the
speed of fluctuations in frequency, reducing the level of frequency response required.

• Shifting transmission of energy to uncongested periods, therefore reducing the need to reinforce
transmission and distribution networks

Each of these services has its own market arrangements, with the exception of inertia, which is not 
currently remunerated. 

Notes: National Grid procures a number of services that do not directly relate to the definition of flexibility 
proposed above (e.g. Intertrips, Black Start, Reactive Power Services). These services are outside the scope of this 
analysis. 

Until recently, these flexibility services have mostly been provided by fossil generation, 
supported by pumped-storage hydroelectricity, with large industrial electricity users providing a 
degree of demand response in the wholesale energy and balancing markets. As renewable 
generation increases and fossil generation decreases, these services will increasingly need to be 
met by non-fossil generation. 

In 2015 we commissioned Imperial College to investigate the system integration costs of low-
carbon generation. A key finding of this work was that flexibility must improve significantly if 
additions of variable renewables are to effectively reduce system carbon intensity (Box 2.4). 
Improved flexibility would mean that the overall costs of running the electricity system would be 




Chapter 2: Power 61 

reduced and the incremental system costs of adding wind and solar generation would be 
limited to £10/MWh. 

Key options for flexibility include fossil-fired generation that is designed to be highly flexible, 
storage, demand-side response, and interconnection. There are also opportunities to provide 
more flexibility services from existing generators and to adjust existing system operation. 

Box 2.4. Impact of low-carbon generation on system carbon intensity, and importance of flexibility 

Recent modelling from Imperial College helped to identify and quantify the extent to which the low-
carbon generation in our scenarios will change system flexibility requirements. Increased generation 
from variable renewable generation can impose costs and constraints on the existing electricity 
system, if not properly managed. This is because: 

• Some renewable generation will be curtailed at times of low demand and high output (e.g. on
sunny, windy summer days). Reducing curtailment would avoid the need for further low-carbon
investment.

• Renewable generation will often be insufficient to meet demand, requiring back-up capacity.

• Intermittent renewable generation, like wind power, will increase the volatility of net demand (the
amount of demand that remains unmet after intermittent generation is subtracted), requiring
steeper ramping up and down of other generation. Imperial College estimated around a
doubling in system ramping requirements in our 2030 scenarios.

• Additional reserve capacity (up to 40% increase in our scenarios) must be held to accommodate
the possibility that renewables will generate less than forecast, alongside a more frequent need for
these higher reserve levels to be used (double the amount of hours).

• System inertia will decrease as fossil generation decreases, requiring a higher degree of frequency
response. Frequency response requirements will be greatest at times of high renewables output
and low demand. Additional frequency response is also required if the system is unable to meet a
steeper ramping requirement. Imperial's modelling suggests a future system requires a larger
capacity of frequency response plant in 2030, operating in twice the amount of hours as today's
system.

• Conventional fossil generators have a level of minimum stable generation (i.e. are not able to
start up instantly and must therefore run part-loaded in order to be available when required).
Furthermore, such generators are not fuel-efficient at minimum stable generation. Conventional
generators also have a maximum ramp rate, such that they cannot generate large volumes of
electricity over short spaces of time.

• If the system is unable to absorb all of its renewable generation, and requires fossil plant to run
part-loaded in order to provide the necessary back-up, ramping, reserve and frequency response,
the system CO2 intensity will remain high (e.g. up to 200 gCO2/kWh) even with a major expansion
of low-carbon capacity.

In order to minimise the carbon intensity of a system with high levels of renewables, some 
combination of the following options is necessary: 

• Deploy flexible fossil generators with lower levels of minimum stable generation and faster
ramping, and that are more efficient under these conditions. Technologies to achieve this are
available at moderate cost, but there is currently insufficient incentive to deploy them.

• Use storage, demand-side response and interconnection to absorb surplus renewable
generation, and provide reserve and frequency response services, limiting the role of fossil

Box 2.4. Impact of low-carbon generation on system carbon intensity, and importance of flexibility 

generators in providing back-up generation, reserve and frequency response. 

• Reduce the need for reserve through improved forecasting of wind and solar generation.

• Reduce the need for frequency response by deploying smaller generators, reducing rate of
change of frequency (RoCoF) constraints, allowing nuclear generators to provide inertia and
wind generators to provide “synthetic inertia”, and deploying higher-inertia fossil generators.

• Allow renewables to provide frequency response when curtailed.

Imperial estimated that the overall annual costs of running the electricity system would be reduced by 
£3-5 billion if flexibility resources were able to make a full contribution in 2030. Even without a shift to 
intermittent renewables, flexibility would reduce the overall costs of running the system.

(b) Flexibility roadmap 

Barriers to increasing flexibility and options for tackling them 

Given the importance of improving flexibility to reducing CO2 emissions and cutting cost we 
commissioned Pöyry and Imperial College to develop a roadmap for what is needed to enable 
low-carbon flexibility resources to come onto the system at sufficient scale to 2030. Pöyry and 
Imperial College identified a range of barriers, which are likely to result in under-investment in 
flexibility solutions, and a set of actions to resolve these barriers. 

The barriers and required actions can be grouped into four main areas: ensuring that markets 
reflect full system value, managing complexity, supporting innovation and ensuring effective 
consumer participation:  

• Ensuring that markets reflect full system value. The current set of markets do not
incentivise sufficient deployment of flexibility technologies as technology providers are not
able to capture the value of all the services they are capable of providing, or face
unnecessary risks in doing so.

‒ Providers cannot receive remuneration for all sources of value (e.g. providers of
Enhanced Frequency Response are not able to participate in the capacity market). 
Combining value streams is important, as for example for a battery storage operator 
frequency response represents just 30% of the total value it is able to provide to the 
system, the capacity market represents another 20%, balancing services 20%, and energy 
arbitrage and avoiding network reinforcement the rest. 

‒ There is considerable uncertainty over future requirements for flexibility services, 
particularly over longer (e.g. ten-year) time horizons. That partly reflects uncertainty over 
how policy will drive deployment of intermittent capacity or different sources of 
flexibility. 

‒ There is a lack of appropriate temporal price signals. For example, 'gate closure' (the 
last point at which generators can sell their energy in the wholesale market) is one hour 
ahead of real-time. Other European countries are moving to periods that are closer to real 
time (e.g. 15-30 minutes). Separately, Frequency Response contracts are procured several 
weeks in advance, so may not align to real-time system needs. 




Chapter 2: Power 63 

‒ Procurement of flexibility services is complex and lacks transparency, differing in 
terms of technical requirements, validation processes, contract types and procurement 
platform, increasing complexity and reducing transparency.  

‒ The current allocation of network charges is not cost-reflective. For example, storage 
operators are treated as both a consumer and a generator, which results in them paying 
twice for transmission and distribution charges.  

‒ The current allocation of non-network charges is also not cost-reflective. For 
example, the largest plant on the system drives the need for frequency response, but the 
cost of providing this is socialised. Separately, renewables offer limited capacity value, 
but are not charged for the provision of back up capacity that they then require.  

• Managing complexity. There will be an increase in the complexity of the electricity system,
across multiple network operators and an increasing heterogeneity of infrastructures. This
will make it more important that operators are incentivised to minimise costs across the
whole system, not just in their networks.

• Supporting innovation. Incentives to develop and reward innovative flexibility solutions
are currently inadequate. Current network standards do not allow investment in flexibility
resources and further innovation required to develop pre-commercial technologies to
maturity.

• Ensuring effective consumer participation. There are a range of barriers to unlocking
demand-side response, including improving consumer awareness and engagement, and
both real and perceived issues around data privacy and cyber security. Appliance
manufacturers may choose not to implement demand-response ('smart') capability across
product ranges.

Our recommendations below are intended to deal with these barriers to create a technology-
neutral investment environment, which must enable efficient investment decisions, manage 
greater complexity, support innovation and ensure effective consumer participation. 

The full list of barriers and actions, including the associated time frame, responsibility and 
priority, is set out in Pöyry and Imperial College (2017) Roadmap for Flexibility Services to 2030, 
published on the Committee's website.  

Scenarios for increasing flexibility 

Modelling by Pöyry and Imperial College identified a range of scenarios for growth of different 
flexibility providers to 2030 (Table 2.4). The wide ranges reflect that the best balance between 
different forms of flexibility will depend on factors that are hard to predict in advance, such as 
how technologies will develop, how consumers will respond and what the mix of low-carbon 
generating technologies will be. 

Given the uncertainty, we will monitor progress against the ranges in Table 2.4, rather than 
against specific point estimates. Lower deployment of one option could be compensated by 
higher uptake of another technology, thus meeting the system’s overall flexibility requirements. 
However, a consistent low deployment of one or more technologies across several years would 
be a flag for further investigation.  

As key enablers of demand-side response, we will also continue to monitor the take-up of smart 
meters (for which the Government has published a target trajectory) and we will monitor take 
up of smart appliances and growth in the market for aggregation (firms that 'aggregate' demand 




64 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap    |   Committee on Climate Change 

response across multiple consumers and provide flexibility services based on the aggregated 
potential). These will be part of our broader monitoring, but we have not set target trajectories 
given limited evidence to base them on.

Notes: The table shows additional flexibility technology requirements compared to today's levels. New flexible 
generation is defined as a CCGT 'H' class generator (or a generator with similar or more flexible characteristics).  

Recommendations 

The barriers must be addressed in order to enable fully low-carbon flexibility resources. We 
therefore make the following recommendations: 
• Markets should be designed to reflect the full system value of flexibility options. The

market design must effectively price and reward energy, capacity and flexibility. For example,
this requires removal of double-charging for storage, completing the shift to half-hourly
settlement and allowing flexibility providers to receive multiple revenue streams across
different services.

• Market rules should seek to reduce complexity, but system operators will need to
manage greater complexity (across multiple sources/boundaries). Increasing flexibility
implies a shift in system control from the transmission to the distribution level and a
capability of the system to deal with more interactions between distribution and
transmission networks, and to promote and utilise more active demand management.

• Support should be available for innovation in technology, services and operating
models. It will be important that, as the institutional and market framework evolves, the
drive for innovation across the value chain is not dampened. Where innovation offers
significant system benefit that cannot be captured by the innovators, it may require public
support.

• Intervention may be needed to encourage greater consumer participation. In addition
to establishing the technical infrastructure for demand-side response, legal and regulatory
frameworks around consumer protection and data protection will be necessary to achieve
widespread consumer acceptance. Standards may be required to ensure widespread uptake
of smart appliances.

To monitor implementation of these recommendations, we will monitor progress against a 
number of high priority actions that Pöyry and Imperial identified (Table 2.5).

Progress is already being made in addressing the barriers and actions identified: 

• In late 2016 BEIS and Ofgem conducted a joint call for evidence on the actions required to
transition to a smart, flexible electricity system.

• Ofgem is making progress with half-hourly metering, and embedded benefits reform.

• The Energy Networks Association has created a working group to identify the appropriate
long-term roles for transmission and distribution system operators.

• National Grid, through its Power Responsive programme, is working on improving
information on system requirements, reducing complexity in its contracting system and
reforming its energy services markets. The recent publication of National Grid's System Needs
and Product Strategy consultation marks an important step in addressing these issues.

Progress will need to continue from all parties, to manage the transition to a smart, flexible 
electricity system and to ensure that the future electricity system delivers power at the lowest 
possible cost.

Key messages and recommendations 

Direct emissions in buildings rose for the second year running in 2016, to 89 MtCO2e. Adjusting for 
annual variations in winter temperatures, emissions rose by around 2%.  

Progress made in reducing emissions from homes over the first carbon budget period (2008-2012) has 
stalled. Progress in reducing emissions across public and commercial buildings has hardly begun. 

Although around 4% of heat now comes from low-carbon sources, around 80% of this is bioenergy 
(largely biomass, which could be used more effectively for emission reduction elsewhere in the longer 
term). The deployment of heat pumps and low-carbon heat networks is below what is required for 
meeting future carbon budgets. Progress in reducing demand through insulation has stalled with 
modest installations occurring through the Energy Company Obligation (ECO), overall rates down over 
90% from 2012, and a significant policy gap in incentivising uptake from able-to-pay households. 

Our key messages are: 

• Policy gap. Compared to our assessment of the cost-effective path to meeting the fifth carbon
budget, there is a policy gap to decarbonising buildings of 19 MtCO2 in 2030 (a fifth of the total
policy gap across the economy, and nearly twice the expected reduction from existing buildings
policies). 9 MtCO2 of the savings from existing policies are at risk due to policy design and
implementation issues, which mean that they may not deliver. This must be addressed in the
Government’s proposals for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets, as set out in our 2016
report, Next Steps for UK Heat Policy.

• New-build. New homes should be built to be highly energy efficient and designed for low-carbon
heating systems. That will avoid costly retrofit in future and ensure household energy bills are no
higher than needed. There is no robust evidence this would appreciably reduce or delay new
housing supply to meet Government targets for new housing.

• Energy efficiency improvement to existing buildings. Energy efficiency should be improved
across the existing building stock. This can reduce emissions and energy bills, improve
competitiveness and asset values for business, improve health and wellbeing, help to tackle fuel
poverty and make buildings more suitable for low-carbon heating in future.

• Low-carbon heat. Deployment of low-carbon heat cannot wait until the 2030s. Low-regret
opportunities exist for heat pumps to be installed in homes that are off the gas grid, to install low-
carbon heat networks in heat-dense areas (e.g. cities) and to increase volumes of biomethane
injection into the gas grid. These opportunities can be started within funding that has been agreed
to 2020, although this could be better targeted. Further support beyond 2020 will need to be
agreed by 2019.

• Strategic decisions for the longer term. Beyond these low-regret measures, key strategic
decisions will be needed on low-carbon heat for properties on the gas grid, especially those
outside heat-dense areas.

‒ The main options for reducing emissions from heating in these buildings are electrification 
using heat pumps and repurposing of gas networks to hydrogen. It is important that active 
preparations are made so that the Government is well placed to make decisions in the early 
2020s, including undertaking hydrogen pilots of sufficient scale and diversity.  

‒ As large-scale hydrogen deployment would require use of carbon capture and storage 
(CCS), a strategy for CCS deployment remains an urgent priority.

against the following checklist (Table 3.1).

the sale or rental of buildings.

• Improving the efficiency of existing heating systems (e.g. by moving to

Introduction 
In this chapter we review progress in decarbonising UK buildings in 2016. We draw on the 
findings from our 2016 report, Next Steps for UK Heat Policy, in addressing the current weaknesses 
in the policy framework for meeting future carbon budgets.  

We summarise the analysis that underpins our key messages and recommendations in the 
following three sections: 

1. Buildings emissions trends and drivers

2. Recent progress in reducing emissions in buildings compared to required progress

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets.

1. Buildings emissions trends and drivers
Direct emissions from buildings were 89 MtCO2e in 2016, accounting for 19% of UK GHG 
emissions (Figure 3.1): 

• Direct CO2 building emissions were 88 Mt in 2016, split between homes (76%), commercial
buildings (15%) and public buildings (10%).

• Buildings are responsible for 66% of UK electricity consumption, equivalent to a further 52
Mt CO2e of indirect emissions. These emissions are falling, both due to falls in demand and
decarbonisation of electricity supply (Chapter 2).

• There are small quantities of non-CO2 emissions (methane and nitrous oxide). Estimates for
2016 are not available, so we assume that they remain at 2015 levels in line with Government
assumptions.

Throughout the rest of this chapter, we focus on CO2 emissions, for which we have provisional 
2016 estimates. 

Direct CO2 emissions increased for the second year running in 2016 (Figure 3.2). Adjusting for 
annual variations in winter temperatures, emissions rose by around 2% (Table 3.2).36  

The progress made in reducing emissions from homes over the first carbon budget period 
(2008-2012) has stalled. Progress in reducing emissions across public and commercial buildings 
has hardly begun. 

36 Compared to a 4% rise in direct CO2 emissions in the unadjusted emissions data.

Notes: 2016 emissions are provisional. Figures may not sum due to rounding. 

The least-cost pathway to the legislated carbon budget requires a CO2 emissions reduction of 
around 20% in buildings from 2016 to 2030,37 equivalent to a fall of 32% from 1990 levels. 
Decarbonising the building stock will require both decarbonising the supply by substituting 
fossil fuels with low-carbon electricity, fuels and heat sources ('low-carbon heat'), along with 
reducing and managing demand through energy efficiency measures, storage and demand-
side response.  

Our indicator framework for buildings is designed to capture changes on both fronts, with top-
level indicators tracking total demand for energy used for heat and the supply of low-carbon 
heat. These top-level indicators are complemented by a set of supporting indicators which track 
the rollout of low-carbon measures and policy indicators that highlight necessary policy 
development (Figure 3.3).  

To 2030, emission reductions can be achieved by supporting the roll-out of low-regrets supply-
side measures such as heat pumps primarily in buildings not connected to the gas grid, low-
carbon heat networks and biomethane injected into the gas network. This is required together 
with low-cost energy efficiency measures across all buildings (unlocking energy savings of 
around 15%), and tighter standards in new-build to avoid further costly retrofit between now 
and 2050. 

37 This equates to a 20% reduction in CO2e to 2030. Excluding biomethane abatement, consistent with reporting in 
the CCC (2015) Fifth Carbon Budget and CCC (2016) Next Steps for UK Heat Policy, it is equal to a 16% reduction in 
buildings CO2.

2. Recent progress in reducing emissions in buildings compared to
required progress 
The necessary progress is not being made in shifting to low-carbon heating or improving energy 
efficiency: 
• Low-carbon heat deployment to date, whilst on track against our current indicator in

aggregate, is dominated by bioenergy deployment (around 80% of which most is solid
biomass), whilst the deployment of heat pumps and low-carbon heat networks lags behind
what is required to meet future carbon budgets. The dominance of biomass in low-carbon
heat uptake to date is an issue because of questions around whether this is the long-term
best use of finite bioenergy resource, and due to the existence of other options for
decarbonising space heating in buildings.38

• Progress in reducing demand through insulation has largely ground to a halt with modest
installations occurring through the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and a significant
policy gap in incentivising uptake by able-to-pay households (Table 3.3).

• We do not have a set of detailed indicators on public and commercial energy efficiency due
to a lack of consistent data sources, but energy intensity (kWh/m2 of floor space) remained
flat in 2015, the latest year for which data are available.

The following section considers progress in each of these areas in turn.39 

38 CCC (2016) Next Steps for UK Heat Policy. 
39 Some measures arguably cover both elements: heat pumps, for example, can make use of low-carbon electricity 
and use a fraction of the energy of traditional combustion heating. We consider them primarily as a key form of low-
carbon heating.

Chapter 3: Buildings 77 

Low-carbon heat 

Our approach for tracking the decarbonisation of heat supply is to track the contribution of low-
carbon sources to heat demand in buildings and industry (Chapter 4) at an aggregate level. This 
is currently at around 4% in buildings, although around 80% bioenergy - dominated by biomass
consumed in homes (62%).40 

We also consider progress in the areas which we have highlighted as low-regrets on a supply-
side basis, either because they are valuable across all decarbonisation pathways (biomethane, 
low-carbon heat networks) and/or because current deployment is required to keep in play the 
option of more extensive future deployment (heat pumps and low-carbon heat networks). 
Progress is improving for biomethane but remain insufficient on heat pumps: 

• Current levels of deployment of biomethane are below our indicator, although output
doubled in 2016, significantly narrowing the gap (Table 3.3).

• Annual heat pump sales were around 20,000 in 2015, broadly in line with annual levels of
delivery since 2008, and below the 30,000 required annually to meet the 2020 critical path.
Installations of heat pumps in public and commercial buildings remain at very low levels (a
few thousand a year).

• No consistent data are available on low-carbon heat networks deployment, as we
highlighted in last year's report. Government should address this as a priority action.

We consider options for improving policy to address this slow progress in section 3. 

Demand reduction and management in homes 

Progress in delivering insulation slowed during 2016 from levels already far lower than achieved 
up to 2012 (Figure 3.4). 

The natural replacement of older boilers continued to deliver some reductions in emissions: 1.5 
million old boilers were replaced with more efficient A-rated boilers in 2016. The average design 
efficiency of boilers sold in 2016 was 90.5%.  

Total household electricity demand in 2016 fell by 1%, continuing a longer-term trend. Falling 
demand has been driven by a general improvement in the energy efficiency of appliances. 
However, the penetration of the most energy efficient appliances still remains low (fewer than 
1% of lightbulbs are LEDs and under 2% of cold appliances meet the highest A++ rating) leaving 
plenty of further potential to reduce demand. 

40 We do not include biomass consumed on open fires since this does not constitute meaningful progress towards 
decarbonising the supply of heat.

Notes: Installations under government schemes. 

Demand reduction and management in public and commercial buildings 

Progress is harder to track in public and commercial buildings, due to the huge variation of 
building type and lack of consistent datasets covering all buildings. Overall measures of energy 
intensity show no evidence of underlying progress in 2015. There is some evidence of reductions 
in energy consumption in (larger) organisations covered by the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme: 

• Energy intensity remained unchanged in 2015, the latest year for which there are available
data (Box 3.1).

• There were greater reductions in electricity and gas consumed by organisations covered by
the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme than in non-residential buildings overall (Box 3.2).

• The wider ESOS energy audits scheme is struggling to achieve levels of basic compliance
(Box 3.2).

There remains significant potential for improved energy efficiency in public and commercial 
buildings.

Box 3.1. Lack of progress in energy intensity of public and commercial buildings 

Energy intensity measured as energy consumption per unit of output was little changed in 2015. This 
follows on from a gradual decline from 2010, with a marked decrease in 2014. However, change in 
energy consumption per unit of floor-space is likely to be a better indicator. While information for the 
public sector is not available, Figure B3.1 shows only a marginal improvement since 2000 for 
commercial buildings on this basis, with energy intensity slightly worse in 2015 than in 2014. While 
data on public sector floor-space are not available, we anticipate that public sector floor-space has 
decreased over this period, meaning it too would have a lesser improvement in energy intensity if 
measured on a floor-space basis rather than by output.

in non-residential buildings, as well as large industrial and agricultural firms outside the EU ETS. Phase 
2 of the scheme started in 2014/15, making significant changes in scope, so trends over longer periods 
are not readily comparable. There have been greater reductions in electricity and gas consumption for 
organisations in the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme than the wider public and commercial sectors in 
2015/16:  

• Electricity consumption was 5% lower in private buildings in the CRC in 2015/16 than the previous
year compared to a 1% decrease in the sector overall. Gas consumption in 2015/16 was 1% lower in

• Electricity consumption in 2015/16 was 4% lower in public buildings in the CRC than the previous
year compared to a 2% increase in the sector overall. Gas consumption was 3% lower in public
buildings in the CRC than the previous year, compared to 2% lower in the sector overall.

The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) is a mandatory energy assessment scheme for 
organisations in the UK that meet the qualification criteria. Organisations must have assessments every 
4 years, which audit the energy used by their buildings, industrial processes and transport to identify 
cost-effective energy saving measures. The deadline for the first compliance period was December 
2015. There have been relatively low compliance rates. By the end of January 2017 around 6,800 
organisations had submitted a notification of compliance, which is around 860 more than had 
complied by the extended deadline of January 2016. 30 more have submitted an intent to comply. 
While data are not released on those who have not self-declared, there are expected to be significant 
numbers of other organisations not complying, given BEIS's estimate of around 10,000 organisations 
being covered by the scheme.41

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
In October 2016 we published a report on Next Steps for UK Heat Policy, which set out our 
assessment of the set of policy options to drive decarbonisation of the building stock to 2030. It 
underscores the need to prepare for Government-led decisions on the future of the gas grid, 
together with strengthened policy now to increase the implementation of energy efficiency 
measures and low-carbon heat over the next decade. 

Current policy provides some incentives for low-carbon measures, including the pilot round of 
heat networks capital funding, hydrogen research and ongoing revisions to the Energy 
Company Obligation (ECO) announced in the year since our 2016 progress report: 

• Heat networks. The Government's Heat Networks Investment Project (HNIP) has announced
the results of the first pilot round of the pot of £320m to 2020 to support low-carbon heat
networks. This was limited to public sector applicants. The schemes funded are mainly gas
CHP rather than more innovative low-carbon networks.

• Hydrogen trials. Government has announced £25m funding for a three-year hydrogen trial
looking at developing standards and testing appliances, running from 2017.

• Energy efficiency. The main change has been to redesign ECO. It is planned to run from
April 2017 for five years at an estimated cost of £640m per year (compared to £870m per year
in the scheme 2015-2017).

‒ The ECO scheme has entered a transition period from April 2017 to September 2018,
moving towards a new scheme focused on fuel poverty from 2018-2022. Changes in the 
transition period include a greater focus on providing Affordable Warmth for fuel-poor

households, less emphasis on cost-effective insulation and the removal of a community 
based sub-obligation. 

‒ The ECO redesign has also moved towards 'deemed scores' - intended to reduce
administrative costs - and a limit upon the extent boiler replacements can count towards
targets. While reduced emphasis on boilers is helpful in improving efficiency longer-term, 
we expect the reduced size and focus away from low-cost insulation to generate lesser 
emission savings than under the previous scheme.  

In other areas such as low-carbon finance and company reporting, it is less clear how policy will 
impact future decarbonisation and there remains a risk to the effectiveness of regulations on the 
minimum energy efficiency of private rented dwellings (Box 3.3). 

Box 3.3. Recent developments with low-carbon finance and the future of the CRC Energy Efficiency 
Scheme 

In January 2017 Greenstone Finance and Aurium Capital Markets acquired the business and assets of 
the Green Deal Finance Company, which the government had ceased funding in July 2015. 
Installations using the Green Deal, which ceased during the latter part of 2016, may start to return. 
However, it is not clear that the take-up will be any better than for the original scheme, under which 
rates of insulation were well below the necessary level.  

The return of the Green Deal also adds complexity to policy reform in other areas, for example the 
domestic Private Rented Sector (PRS) regulations which were set up to be reliant on the Green Deal, 
but which the government were reviewing given the impracticality of this going forward. Urgent 
action is needed to amend the regulations, as from October 2017 landlords can register for exemptions 
(lasting five years) if they would face upfront costs in undertaking the necessary improvements. 

The government announced in April 2017 its sale of the Green Investment Bank to Macquarie bank. 
This has received a mixed reaction in terms of confidence that it will continue to provide support to the 
low-carbon transition.  

The government plans to close the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme after the 2018/19 compliance year 
and rebalance the Climate Change Levy. Plans for a new reporting framework to fill gaps left by the 
ending of the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme - first promised March 2016 - are still awaited.

There are several important areas that current policy does not cover and where there are 
significant risks of under-delivery (Table 3.4). These must be addressed in the Government’s 
proposals for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets, as set out in our 2016 report, Next 
Steps for UK Heat Policy: 

• New homes can and should be built to be highly energy efficient and designed for low-
carbon heating systems. That will avoid costly retrofit in future and ensure household energy
bills are no higher than needed.

• Energy efficiency should be improved across the existing building stock. This can reduce
emissions and energy bills, improve competitiveness and asset values for business, improve
health and wellbeing, help tackle fuel poverty and make buildings more suitable for low-

carbon heating in future. The planned future review of business energy costs must include 
the significant energy efficiency potential in commercial buildings. 

• Deployment of low-carbon heat cannot wait until the 2030s. Low-regret opportunities exist
for heat pumps to be installed in homes that are off the gas grid, to install low-carbon heat
networks in heat-dense areas (e.g. cities) and to increase volumes of biomethane injection
into the gas grid.

‒ Heat pumps have faced challenges to date, but remain the leading low-carbon option for
buildings not connected to the gas grid. Together with installation in new-build 
properties, heat pump installation in buildings off the gas grid can help to create the 
scale needed for supply chains to develop, including developing skills and experience, 
potentially in advance of accelerated roll-out after 2030. Installation of around 200,000 
heat pumps between 2015 and 2020 under our scenarios is consistent with the 
announced funding to 2020 available under the Renewable Heat Incentive, provided that 
funding is focused on heat pumps and deployed efficiently, learning lessons from past 
experience in the UK and elsewhere. Further funding will be needed for deployment in 
the 2020s.  

‒ Low-carbon heat networks require a certain density of heat demand in order to be 
economic, which means that they are suited to urban areas, new-build developments 
and some rural areas. Low-carbon heat sources can include waste heat, large-scale (e.g. 
water-source) heat pumps, geothermal heat and potentially hydrogen. Current capital 
funding to 2020 is sufficient to meet the ambition required to 2020, provided it is 
deployed effectively. A mechanism is needed for supporting the continued expansion of 
low-carbon heat networks through the 2020s, including attracting new types of investor 
and establishing a proportionate regulatory framework. 

‒ Injecting biomethane into the gas grid is a means of decarbonising supply without 
requiring changes from consumers, and provides a route for capture and use of methane 
emissions from biodegradable wastes. However, its potential is limited to around 5% of 
gas consumption. 

• Beyond these low-regret measures, key strategic decisions will be needed on low-carbon
heat for properties on the gas grid, especially those outside heat-dense areas. The key
options are electrification using heat pumps and repurposing of gas networks to hydrogen. It
is important that active preparations are made so that the Government is well placed to
make decisions in the early 2020s, including undertaking hydrogen pilots of sufficient scale
and diversity. As large-scale hydrogen deployment would require use of carbon capture and
storage (CCS), a strategy for CCS deployment remains an urgent priority.

The previous Government recognised the need to improve the evidence base and provide 
policy direction. It recognised that whilst there is "no consensus on the best mix of these 
technologies … we need a clearer shared understanding … Our ambition is to be able to agree 
in the next few years, together, on the right long-term direction for heat policy".42 A programme 
of research on strategic heat options was established to support this aim, delivering through 
2017, covering infrastructure impacts, costs and future market models. 

However, until these areas are addressed there will remain a policy gap to the fourth and fifth 
carbon budgets (Figure 3.5).

Chapter 3: Buildings 83 

In our 2016 report, Next Steps for UK Heat Policy, we identify a number of policy principles for an 
effective approach to increase the implementation of low-carbon actions, based on evidence 
from three 'What Works' policy reviews and an expert advisory group. This evidence supports 
the need for a stable framework and direction of travel taking a joined-up approach on energy 
efficiency and low-carbon heat, which is backed up by standards tightened over time and 
simple, highly visible information and certification: 

• A stable framework and direction of travel, backed up by standards for the emissions
performance of buildings that would tighten over time.

‒ The schedule of future standards should be clear to allow businesses and consumers to
prepare efficiently and for dynamic markets to emerge. As far as practical, standards 
should be focused on ends (e.g. reducing carbon emissions) rather than the means (e.g. 
specific technologies) and based on actual rather than modelled performance (e.g. by 
using data from smart meters).  

‒ Where existing standards are in place or planned under European law (product 
standards), these will need to either remain in place or be replaced with equivalent 
regulation following UK exit from the EU. 

• A joined-up approach to energy efficiency and low-carbon heat that works across the
building stock, targets specific segments and focuses on real-world performance where
possible.

‒ Emissions reductions can be achieved by improving energy efficiency and by shifting to
low-carbon fuels. Many of the barriers to action (e.g. disruption from changes, the need 
to find a trusted installer, financing constraints) are shared across both types of measure. 
In addition, improved energy efficiency can reduce the cost and improve the suitability of 
buildings for low-carbon heat options.  

‒ Policy should target distinct groups of householders and businesses. For example: some 
householders and small businesses will require improved access to low-cost finance; 
existing subsidies for heat pumps are less attractive for smaller homes given economies 
of scale; more generally, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are poorly addressed 
by existing policies. 

‒ Improving the efficiency of existing heating systems (e.g. by moving to lower flow 
temperatures) in homes connected to the gas grid through the 2020s can cut bills and 
emissions, and helps to prepare the stock for widespread roll-out of either heat pumps or 
hydrogen after 2030.43  

• A well-timed offer to households and SMEs on energy efficiency and low-carbon heating
systems that is aligned to ‘trigger points,’ such as house moves, when refurbishment is least
disruptive. This should include improved access to low-cost finance and clear, consistent
incentives.

• Simple, highly-visible information and certification alongside installer training to ensure that
low-carbon options are understood by consumers and that installers are effective and
trusted.

43 Condensing boilers need to be set with return temperatures no higher than 55 degrees Celsius in order to work 
efficiently. 




84 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap   |   Committee on Climate Change 

‒ Awareness of low-carbon heating and energy efficiency options is currently low. In 
businesses, energy performance is assessed infrequently and often not discussed at 
senior management or board level, and so has little strategic value or ‘salience’. A key 
policy focus must be improved information (which could be enabled by smart meters), 
through business performance reporting and building performance labelling that 
generates value in low-carbon investment.  

‒ A nationwide training programme is needed to develop high professional standards and 
skills for implementation of low-carbon choices in the building and heat supply trades. 
There is a need to build an improved understanding across the construction sector, 
installers and Government about what is required for high-quality heat pump and heat 
network retrofit across a range of different types of buildings, the interactions with 
measures to improve fabric efficiency of buildings, and how to standardise and drive 
down retrofit costs.  

‒ There is also an opportunity for leadership through public procurement and low-carbon 
investment, given that the public sector constitutes a third of non-residential heating 
needs and almost a fifth of heating energy in non-residential leased buildings.  

In the 2016 report, we published a set of example policy packages which show how measures 
can be combined to form coherent policy packages for residential and non-residential buildings, 
together with supporting heat infrastructure. 

We expect the plans for meeting the fifth carbon budget to address all the areas set out above 
and set clear timelines for the development and implementation of policies that remain at the 
proposal stage. We will publish our assessment of the proposals subsequent to their publication.

Key messages and recommendations 

Based on provisional data, industry emissions fell by 9% in 2016 to 100 MtCO2e while industrial output 
grew around 1%. This follows average annual emissions reductions of 2% over the period 2009-2015 
and a halving of emissions since 1990. Almost half of the reduction in industrial emissions in 2016 
reflects the closure of the Redcar steelworks, which was mainly due to the depressed price of steel from 
global overcapacity and an appreciation in the pound. 

Our key messages for the industry sector are: 

• There has been limited progress developing the policy framework to drive industrial
emissions reduction. In our 2015 and 2016 Progress Reports, we recommended development of
plans with clear actions and milestones to realise abatement identified by the '2050 Roadmaps' - a
set of decarbonisation pathways to 2050 for eight of the most energy-intensive industrial sectors.
We also highlighted that there is an urgent need for an approach to the demonstration and
commercialisation of industrial carbon capture and storage (CCS). There has been no progress on
these issues in the past year.

• Policy strengthening will be required to achieve the necessary emissions reductions to 2030.
Industrial emissions are expected to be higher than the levels set out in our fifth carbon budget
scenarios, under current Government plans. There are many areas of potential emissions reduction
where policies are either missing (10 MtCO2e in 2030) or have significant delivery risk (3 MtCO2e in
2030).  

We will assess the Government's plan for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets against the 
following checklist (Table 4.1).

significant methane leaks in order to limit the impact of ‘super-

Introduction 
In this chapter we review progress in reducing emissions from the UK industry sector and outline 
priorities for taking forward the policy framework to ensure that we build on this progress and 
meet future carbon budgets. We summarise the analysis that underpins our key messages and 
recommendations in the following three sections: 

1. Industry emission trends and drivers

2. Progress in reducing industrial emissions

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets

1. Industry emission trends and drivers

Background 

Direct44 emissions from industry45 in 2016 (100 MtCO₂e) accounted for almost a quarter of UK 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Figure 4.1). Over 90% of these direct GHG emissions were of 
CO₂ (Figure 4.2): 

• Manufacturing, construction, water and waste management made up 60% of industrial
GHG emissions.46

‒ Combustion emissions, from burning fuel for the production of low- and high-grade heat,
drying/separation, space heating and electricity generation for own use accounted for 
80% of manufacturing emissions. Almost a third of combustion emissions were 
unclassified (i.e. not attributed to a sector or segmented by use). 

‒ Process emissions from chemical reactions within industry (e.g. calcination of limestone 
in the production of cement) accounted for the remaining 20%. 

• Refining of petroleum products and other energy supply made up 40% of industrial
emissions. Other energy supply emissions (extraction and production of oil, gas and solid
fuels) accounted for two-thirds of this, over a quarter of which were non-CO2 emissions.

In addition to these direct emissions, industry consumed almost a third of UK grid electricity, 
implying indirect emissions of around 5% of UK GHG emissions (see Chapter 2). 

Industrial production and emissions are not evenly spread across the UK. For example, industry 
accounted for 34% of total Welsh emissions in 2015, with nearly half of these coming from the 
Port Talbot steelworks. 

44 Direct emissions exclude emissions from generation of electricity supplied through the grid, which are covered in 
Chapter 2.  
45 Industrial activity includes manufacturing, construction, water and waste management, refining of petroleum 
products and a range of activities linked to energy supply (extraction and production of oil, gas and solid fuels).  
46 From this point forward references to manufacturing will also include the construction and waste and water 
management sectors.

Chapter 4: Industry 93 

Emission trends 

Provisional data suggest that direct industrial GHG emissions fell by 9% in 2016 (Table 4.2) while 
industrial output grew around 1%. This follows average annual emissions reductions of around 
2% over the period 2009-2015 and a halving of emissions since 1990 (Figure 4.3): 

• Direct CO₂ emissions from industry fell by 9.3% in 2016, following an annual average 1.6%
decrease over the period 2009-2015:

‒ Manufacturing CO₂ emissions fell 13% in 2016, following a 4% fall in 2015. Around two-
thirds of the falls in 2015 and 2016 can be explained by a reduction in iron and steel 
production, which was largely due to the closure of Redcar steelworks in Teesside as a 
result of oversupply in the global steel market.  

‒ From 2009 to 2014, manufacturing CO₂ emissions fell by an annual average of around 
0.4%, reflecting a combination of energy intensity improvements, structural changes to 
the manufacturing sector (i.e. faster growth for lower-carbon parts of the manufacturing 
sector) and, to a lesser extent, switches to lower-carbon fuels (Box 4.1).  

‒ Refineries and other energy supply CO₂ emissions fell 1% in 2016, following an annual 
average 2.5% decrease over the period 2009-2015. Half of the 2016 fall can be explained 
by a decrease in refinery output. The 2009-2015 trend can be attributed to a fall in fuel 
production and closures of refineries. 

• Non-CO₂ emissions data are produced with a one-year lag.47 The latest data show 2015
emissions fell by 6% on 2014 levels, with half of the fall resulting from a fall in the amount of
methane vented from deep coal-mines. Over the period 2009-2015, these emissions
decreased 6% annually on average. These reductions have been due to a fall in fuel
production and the introduction of technologies to abate N2O emissions in industrial
processes.

• Grid electricity consumption in manufacturing rose by 0.4% in 2016, following an average
annual 1% decrease over the period 2009-2015.

The closure of the Redcar steelworks in late 2015 was responsible for almost half of the fall in 
industry emissions in 2016. Some reports cited the impact of low-carbon policies on electricity 
prices as the cause of the closure. However, analysis of available evidence suggests that the 
closure of Redcar was mainly due to the depressed price of steel from global overcapacity and 
an appreciation in the pound, rather than the cost of low-carbon polices.48  

The Committee also looked at the impact of low-carbon policies on business more broadly in 
early 2017 and concluded that they have not had a major impact on the competitiveness of UK 
manufacturing to date (Box 4.2).49 

47 As in previous years, the official statistics assume that non-CO2 emissions for the most recent year are the same as 
those for preceding year (i.e. the most recent year for which data are available).

Box 4.1. Manufacturing and refining industries: decomposition analysis of combustion emissions  

A decomposition model for the UK manufacturing and refining sectors combustion emissions allows us 
to analyse the factors that contribute to a change in emissions. A change can be caused by: 

• Output effects (e.g. recession-related emissions reduction).

• Structural effects (e.g. relative mix of manufacturing output moving towards less carbon-
intensive sectors).

• Switching to fuels with lower direct emissions (e.g. coal to gas, or fossil fuel to electricity).

• Energy intensity (e.g. due to energy efficiency, changes in product mix within sectors, or plant
utilisation).

This analysis shows that between 1992 and 2007 improvements in energy intensity and switching to 
lower-carbon fuel were the largest contributors to the reduction in direct CO₂ emissions in the 
manufacturing and refining sectors. Improvements in energy intensity averaged around 1.6% per year 
over this period and switching to lower direct emission fuels saved 0.6% per year. However, between 
2007 and 2009 the majority of the fall in emissions occurred due to a contraction in manufacturing 
output, which disproportionately affected more carbon-intensive firms. 

Over the period 2009-2014 there was a rise in industrial output and the fall in direct CO₂ emissions can 
be attributed to a structural movement towards a less carbon-intensive mix of industrial output 
(accounting for 45% of the change), improvements in energy intensity (45%) and changes in fuel mix 
(10%). 

Energy intensity in this analysis is only a proxy for technical energy efficiency, since it also includes the 
effects of changing product mix and utilisation of plant and equipment. But it provides an indication 
about whether and where industrial energy efficiency is improving.

96 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap   |   Committee on Climate Change 

Box 4.2. Business energy prices and competitiveness 

In March 2017, the Committee published its latest independent analysis of how the UK's carbon 
budgets and related policies affect energy bills for businesses and the implications for 
competitiveness. The report found that: 

• Current bills. Low-carbon policies have increased energy prices for businesses, but have only a
limited impact on the total costs of production for the majority of businesses:

‒ Sector averages. In 2016, energy costs made up an average of 0.9% of operating costs for 
companies in the commercial sector, 2.0% for manufacturing and 3.8% for the fifth of 
manufacturing defined as energy-intensive. The costs associated with low-carbon policies 
made up 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.7% of operating costs in the respective sectors, before 
accounting for any benefits resulting from energy efficiency policies. 

‒ Energy-intensive industry. Energy use varies significantly across businesses, as do energy 
prices and the impact of climate policies. Company-level data are not available to make a 
full assessment of overall impacts. However, whilst for the most energy-intensive 
producers energy costs are a much larger proportion of total costs, these companies are 
considered for compensations and exemptions from policy costs.  

‒ International comparison. UK industrial gas prices are low by European standards but 
electricity prices are high. Differences in low-carbon policies cannot explain the difference 
in electricity prices, which stem primarily from higher wholesale and network costs. It is not 
clear why these costs are higher in the UK than in many comparable economies. This 
should be considered further in the review of business energy costs announced in the 
Government's consultation on the industrial strategy. 

• Competitiveness. Low-carbon policies have not had a major impact on the competitiveness of UK
manufacturing to date. There are at least three reasons to think that competitiveness effects of UK
carbon budgets have been low:

‒ Output trends. With the exception of the financial crisis, the UK’s manufacturing output 
has shown fairly steady slow growth since 1990, despite strengthening low-carbon policies 
since the early 2000s. 

‒ Emissions drivers. Outside the financial crisis, falls in UK industrial emissions largely reflect 
shifts to lower-carbon fuels, improved energy intensity and structural changes towards less 
carbon-intensive manufacturing.  

‒ Impact of low-carbon policy on prices. Following some delays in introduction, industrial 
sectors deemed by the Government 'at most risk of carbon leakage' now receive 
compensation and exemptions from the costs of low-carbon policies. These can reduce 
low-carbon policy costs on electricity by up to 80%. For these companies low-carbon policy 
adds less than 10% to the electricity price, which in the case of steel for example, adds less 
than 2% to operating costs. To ensure that low-carbon policy impacts on competitiveness 
remain small, the Government should ensure compensations and exemptions for 
companies at risk of carbon leakage are predictable and reliable.

2. Progress in reducing industrial emissions
In this section we outline what progress we expect in reducing emissions to 2030, how we will 
track progress in future and the current progress against existing indicators. 

Cost-effective path to reducing industrial emissions 

The fifth carbon budget advice published in December 2015 updated our view on the scope for 
reducing direct emissions in industry to around 80 MtCO₂e in 2030 from 100 MtCO₂e in 2016: 

• Energy efficiency improvement. Improving the process of producing goods can save both
emissions and energy, and thus reduce firms' costs. There are many forms of energy
efficiency which are specific to each industrial sector including: energy and process
management, best available and innovative technology, waste heat recovery and use,
material efficiency and clustering. We have identified around 5 MtCO₂e of cost-effective
abatement potential by 2030.

• Bioenergy used for space and process heat. Sustainable biomass can be utilised as a fuel
or feedstock replacing current fossil fuel sources. We have identified around 4 MtCO₂e of
cost-effective abatement potential by 2030.

• Low-carbon electrification of space and process heat. As electricity from the grid
continues to decarbonise to 2030 and beyond, there is potential to reduce the use of fossil
fuels and therefore emissions through low-carbon electrification of space and process heat,
primarily through use of heat pumps. We have identified around 1 MtCO₂e of cost-effective
abatement potential by 2030.

• Industrial carbon capture and storage and utilisation (CCS/U). Carbon Capture and
Storage (CCS) can be applied to large industrial sites that have few alternative abatement
options, such as: iron and steel, refining, cement, chemicals and industrial combined heat
and power (CHP). CCS could be feasible for deployment in a range of industrial sectors
during the 2020s, reducing annual emissions by around 3 MtCO₂e by 2030, on a path to more
significant implementation by 2050. It will require a new strategy for carbon capture and
storage or utilisation to be developed immediately. That is considered further in Chapter 1.

There is likely to be further abatement potential from resource efficiency in constructing 
buildings and infrastructure, reducing demand for carbon-intensive products.  

Tracking progress 

Figure 4.4 summarises how low-carbon policies and actions feed through to progress reducing 
emissions in the industry sector. 

• Progress requires improvements in energy intensity (TWh/GVA) and in the carbon intensity
of energy (g/kWh). 50

• Suitable policies are needed to drive improvements in energy intensity and carbon intensity
through the approaches highlighted above: energy efficiency improvements, CCS, bioenergy
and electrification.

50 In these contexts, 'energy' includes on-site electricity generation, but excludes electricity from the grid. Emissions 
relating to grid electricity are dealt with in Chapter 2.

• CCS also offers the opportunity to reduce process emissions from the manufacturing and
refining sectors.

We currently track progress against indicators that cover some of these factors and also track 
other changes, such as output and structural changes to provide context.

Notes: Manufacturing combustion emissions include on-site combustion for electricity generation, but do not 
include emissions associated with electricity from the grid.  

Current progress 

There has been mixed progress against our key existing indicators (Table 4.3). Energy intensity 
and carbon intensity have both fallen since 2007, but this mainly reflects structural changes 
rather than genuine progress, and key policies are overdue: 

• From 2007 to 2016, overall direct CO₂ emissions from industry, the emissions intensity of
industrial output, and the energy intensity of industrial output have all matched or
outperformed our existing indicators.

• However, this may not reflect full implementation of cost-effective abatement measures,
because a significant part of the reductions have been the result of changes in industrial
output rather than abatement. A decomposition analysis (Box 4.1) shows that much of the

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
To meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets and 2050 target, policy for industry should deliver 
cost-effective abatement, as outlined in Section 2. To achieve this it must also overcome a 
number of challenges (Box 4.3). In this section we assess Government's progress in developing 
low-carbon policy for industry and outline the steps necessary for industry policy to keep the UK 
on track to meeting the budgets and 2050 target.  




100 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap   |   Committee on Climate Change 

Box 4.3. Challenges to reducing industry emissions 

Achieving our indicated level of abatement will be challenging. It will be important to plan for 
investment in low-carbon measures given long project lead times, and the need to synchronise 
investment with the refurbishment and replacement cycles of the capital stock. 

• Refurbishment and replacement cycles. The abatement measures that we have identified for
carbon-intensive industry in the 2020s typically have long lead times. Given the difficulty of
retrofitting, and to avoid missing low-carbon investment opportunities, it is important to prepare
abatement in line with refurbishment cycles.

• Capital constraints. Many of the cost-effective opportunities in energy-intensive industry have
substantial upfront requirements for capital and longer payback periods. For firms to plan and
finance abatement opportunities, there needs to be a mechanism for reflecting the value of carbon
(e.g. a robust carbon price) with long-term certainty.

• Infrastructure and markets. Some abatement will need provision of infrastructure or creation of
markets outside the control of specific industries. For example, to take full advantage of the
potential abatement from industrial CCS, there needs to be adequate CO₂ transport and storage
infrastructure and an incentive mechanism.

Assessment of existing policy 

The Government has a number of policies for reducing emissions, aimed at encouraging energy 
efficiency improvements, uptake of low-carbon heat and use of bioenergy in industry. However, 
there are significant risks that these policies will under-deliver and there are also gaps in policy 
that need to be addressed in the Government’s proposals for meeting the fourth and fifth 
carbon budgets (Table 4.4): 
• Existing policies risk under-delivery against the Government's current expectations.

According to BEIS’s Updated Energy and Emissions Projections policies for industry will
encourage 2.6 MtCO₂e of abatement in 2030. However, 2.1 MtCO₂e of these estimated
reductions are associated with policies that have significant delivery risk. To strengthen these
policies, the Government needs to monitor closely uptake of low-cost measures and adapt
the policy framework to overcome non-financial barriers.

• We have identified two key areas where the policy framework does not support sufficient
emissions reductions or there is no policy: low-carbon heat after 2021 and industrial CCS
(Table 4.4). These gaps need to be filled in order for decarbonisation in industry to be on
track and to fill the10 MtCO₂e gap between our cost-effective path in 2030 and BEIS’s
estimate of industry direct emissions under current policies.

The Government’s industrial roadmaps project (Box 4.4) was an important first step towards 
unlocking cost-effective abatement potential, but these now need to be translated into delivery 
plans strong enough to support the level of investment required.  




Chapter 4: Industry 101 

Box 4.4. Industry Roadmaps and Action Plans 

Parsons Brinckerhoff and DNV GL were appointed by DECC and BIS to produce a set of ‘Industrial 
Decarbonisation and Energy Efficiency Roadmaps to 2050’ for eight energy-intensive sectors with a 
cross-sector report identifying conclusions that apply across multiple sectors and technology groups.51 
The roadmaps, published in March 2015, are based on a collaborative process featuring contributions 
from industry sector trade associations, their members, officials from DECC and BIS, and other 
experts.52 The sector-specific approach to the roadmaps reflects the nature of the challenges and 
opportunities for each sector, including the barriers and enabling actions to abatement. The 
Government is working with industry to set out plans for how the UK will move abatement efforts 
forward, following the work of the Roadmaps.

policies to support 
industrial energy 
efficiency including: 
CRC, CCL, CCA, EU

incentive for energy 
efficiency (as well as 
other abatement). 

Some policies are at risk of failing to 
deliver the savings that BEIS project. 
Emissions savings from the EU ETS and 
EU product policies are at risk due to 
the UK leaving the EU. Savings from 
building standards are uncertain 
because of compliance and 
performance uncertainty.  
The industrial strategy green paper 
announced a review of how best to 
support greater energy and resource 
efficiency. The 25-year environment 
plan will set out a long-term vision for 
resource efficiency. The EU winter 
package also proposes further product 
standards, which are expected before

Policy recommendations 

To address the shortcomings in existing policy we have identified a number of areas where 
stronger policy is required: 

• A stronger policy framework for industrial energy efficiency.

‒ A new reporting framework. Following the decision in March 2016 to abolish the CRC
energy efficiency scheme, the Government announced that it would consult on a 
replacement reporting framework. However, the consultation has not yet been 
published. The Government should publish this consultation and the new reporting 
framework should maintain incentives, fill information gaps and raise the profile of 
energy efficiency (e.g. through board sign-off). 

‒ Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS). The extent to which the scheme will lead 
to uptake of the most cost-effective measures identified remains uncertain. The 
Government should assess the case for enhancing the energy use audits (e.g. through 
signposting to finance, follow-up support and benchmarking). 

‒ Combined Heat and Power (CHP). A range of incentives exist to encourage take-up of 
CHP in industry. At present, these primarily encourage investment in gas-fired CHP. As 
grid electricity decarbonises in the 2020s, savings from gas CHP will erode. Therefore, 
policy should encourage low-carbon CHP. 

• An effective approach to drive sustained uptake of low-carbon heat in industrial
processes and buildings. An acceleration in low-carbon heat uptake will be required over
the next few years, which will be difficult to meet without addressing all the barriers to
uptake. This will require a policy framework to ensure investment in large-scale industrial
low-carbon heat projects.

• A strategic funded approach to industrial carbon capture and storage. Industrial CCS is a
key set of technologies to meet future carbon budgets and the 2050 target. The Government
should develop a strategic funded approach to industrial CCS, based around clusters
alongside power installations and shared infrastructure, with a new funding mechanism for
industry (Chapter 1).

• Some policy previously set at EU level should be preserved and strengthened in future.
The UK, alongside other Member States, has played a key role in developing EU-level
mechanisms to control emissions in some areas, particularly where it makes sense to take a
coordinated approach (e.g. because the relevant market is EU-wide). In areas where these
EU-level mechanisms are working effectively, the UK should either remain in these schemes
or replicate them at UK level.

‒ Products Policy. EU energy efficiency standards and labelling for products have driven
up the efficiency of electrical goods on sale and removed the least efficient goods from 
the market. After the UK leaves the EU, the UK should maintain or replicate these policies 
and align with the future energy efficient products policy proposed in the EU Winter 
Package to avoid inefficient products with higher running costs and emissions being 
dumped on the UK market.  

‒ EU ETS. The ETS has the potential to be a least-cost approach without creating 
competitiveness challenges for industry. The UK should either remain a part of the EU ETS 
or develop new approaches to ensure industry has incentives to become more energy 




104 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap   |   Committee on Climate Change 

efficient and to invest in low-carbon technologies. Any new approaches outside of the EU 
ETS should not disadvantage UK competitiveness. 

• An overall approach to long-term industrial decarbonisation. The Government should
continue to work with industry to develop and publish a set of plans to move abatement
efforts forward along the paths developed in the Roadmaps, setting out specific actions and
clear milestones. The Government should also extend the coverage of the Roadmaps and
action plans to other industrial sectors. The opportunities identified in the action plans
should be taken into account in the Government's plan to meet the fourth and fifth carbon
budgets, the Industrial Strategy white paper and any future sector deals.

• Tight regulation and close monitoring of any onshore petroleum wells (i.e. shale gas)
during development, production and decommissioning to ensure rapid action to
address leaks. The government should:

‒ Work with the Environment Agency to ensure that companies are required to implement
an appropriate range of technologies and techniques to limit methane emissions. 

‒ Put in place a monitoring regime that catches potentially significant methane leaks in 
order to limit the impact of ‘super-emitters’. 

‒ Prohibit production in areas where it would entail significant CO2 emissions resulting 
from the change in land use. 

‒ Ensure that the regulatory regime requires proper decommissioning of wells at the end 
of their lives. 

Until these areas are addressed there will remain a policy gap (Figure 4.5) between the current 
path and the cost-effective path towards the 2050 target, and therefore the requirements of the 
Climate Change Act (sections 13 and 14) will remain unmet. 

The transition to a low-carbon economy is already underway and presents opportunities for UK 
businesses, both new and existing firms. Grasping those opportunities and ensuring a smooth 
transition must be integral to the Government's new industrial strategy:  

• The UK low-carbon economy is already estimated to employ hundreds of thousands of
people and contribute around 2-3% of GDP, which is a comparable size to energy-intensive
manufacturing. It has been growing faster than the rest of the economy.

• Following the Paris Agreement, global demand for low-carbon goods and services is set to
expand many times over to 2030 and then again to 2050. UK businesses must adapt to meet
this need in place of the declining demand for high-carbon goods and services.

• The UK is particularly well-placed to take advantage of growing global markets for: low-
emission vehicles; low-carbon finance, insurance and consulting; low-carbon electricity;
smart grids and energy efficient products.

As well as producing low-carbon goods and services, industries that will flourish in the future 
must ultimately use low-carbon means of production. An effective approach to support that will 
contribute to the carbon budgets and the industrial strategy.

Key messages and recommendations 

Transport is the largest emitting sector of the UK economy at 121 MtCO2e, with 26% of UK greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions in 2016. Emissions in domestic transport rose for the third consecutive year in 
2016. Demand for travel continues to grow, fleet efficiency reductions have slowed and biofuel usage 
has reduced. The global market for electric vehicles (EVs) is increasingly positive, and UK support 
should continue while the market develops, delivering significant additional benefits in improving air 
quality. Significant opportunities remain to reduce emissions in this sector, but require stronger 
policies and signals over the longer term to provide incentives for efficiency improvements in 
conventional vehicles, switching to ultra-low emissions vehicles and changing travel behaviour.  

Our key messages for the transport sector are: 

• Transport sector emissions increased by 1% in 2016. Increased demand for travel of 2% in both
2015 and 2016 has outpaced efficiency improvements and uptake of sustainable biofuels for cars,
vans and HGVs. Emissions from vans and HGVs increased by 4% and 5% respectively in 2015, the
latest year for which a detailed breakdown of emissions is available.

• Test-cycle new car and van CO 2 improvements fall short of required reductions. New car CO2
emitted per km (intensity) measured by standard test-cycles fell 1.0% in 2016, the lowest decrease
since regulations were introduced. A decrease of 5.7% per year in the remaining four years would
be required to meet the EU wide 2020 target. Concerns remain about the gap between test-cycle
measurements and actual driving emissions.

• Actual fleet CO 2 intensity improvements stalled in 2015 and 2016, due to a reduction in the
proportion of biofuels, slow fleet efficiency improvements and a growing gap between real-world
and test-cycle emissions intensity.

• Sales of electric cars and vans increased to 1.2% of new vehicles in the UK in 2016 to around
38,000 vehicles, in line with our assessment of the cost-effective path. The global EV outlook is
increasingly positive, with an increasing number of longer range EVs becoming available and costs
falling. The market will continue to require support, although it is possible that this could be
phased out sooner than previously expected. Further development of electric vehicle technologies
presents significant business opportunities for the UK.

• Uptake of biofuels fell in 2015 from 2.9% to 2.3% by energy and remained at 2.3% in 2016.
The government has not yet set a trajectory for biofuel uptake to 2020, whilst they consult on how
to extend the policy.

Existing and planned policies leave a further 42 MtCO2 reduction required in 2030 to meet our 
assessment of the cost effective path to meeting the fifth carbon budget. To close that gap, the 
Government's plans for the fourth and fifth carbon budgets must include proposals for setting 
stretching vehicle standards through the 2020s. These should reflect real-world driving emissions, 
necessitate increased take-up of electric vehicles and be effective for the UK market outside the 
European Union. 

We will assess the Government's plan for meeting the gap in the fourth and fifth carbon budgets 
against the following checklist (Table 5.1):

include air quality improvement and opportunities for UK industry.

Introduction 
In this chapter we present the latest data on trends in transport sector emissions and review 
progress towards meeting carbon budgets. We assess current policies and measures in addition 
to outlining policy priorities needed to deliver the cost-effective level of abatement to 2030. We 
report on the broader opportunities that following this path present in other areas such as 
improving air quality and contributing to the UK's industrial strategy.  

We summarise the analysis that underpins our key messages and recommendations in the 
following four sections: 

1. Trends in transport emissions

2. Progress in decarbonising surface transport

3. Progress in reducing aviation and shipping emissions

4. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets

1. Trends in transport emissions

Domestic transport emissions 

Domestic transport greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are provisionally estimated to be 121 
MtCO2e in 2016, and continue to be the largest emitting sector, accounting for 26% of total GHG 
emissions. A detailed breakdown of transport emissions is only available to 2015. Cars, vans and 
HGVs are the three most significant sources of emissions, accounting for 89% of domestic 
transport GHG emissions. (Figure 5.1). Carbon dioxide emissions increased 0.9% from 2015 to 
2016, the third successive year that emissions have risen (Figure 5.2).

This trend needs to be reversed, as a matter of urgency, to deliver a reduction in emissions of 
44% from 2016 to 2030. This will require a major increase in the uptake of electric vehicles, 
improved efficiency of conventional vehicles, increased biofuels use and measures to moderate 
road travel demand across all modes (Figure 5.3).

Economic context 

Changes in road transport have historically been driven by factors such as population, income 
growth and motoring costs (e.g. car purchase, fuel and insurance costs). While other social and 
economic factors such as the rise in internet shopping and availability and reliability of 
alternative transport choices are also important, these are less well understood.  

In 2015, most social and economic drivers supported an increase in demand for travel apart from 
a slight fall in manufacturing output. The most significant change was a steep fall in motoring 
costs. The picture was similar in 2016, although there was a rise in motoring costs largely due to 
increased costs of car insurance (Figure 5.4). The Government’s decision to freeze fuel duty since 
2010/11 has contributed to a reduction in the fuel cost element of motoring costs.

Surface transport emissions trends 

In 2015, surface transport emissions, accounting for 95% of domestic transport, increased 1.9% 
to 114.0 MtCO2e. Road transport emissions increased by 2.1% in 2015 against a 2.2% decrease in 
our indicator based on our fifth carbon budget assessment of the cost-effective path to the 2050 
target. Emissions from cars, vans and HGVs all rose in 2015. The continued growth in road 
transport emissions highlights the urgent need for stronger policies to reduce emissions and 
moderate growth in demand for travel. 

In the sections that follow, we compare emissions, demand and intensity in each mode in 2015 
to our indicators, which reflect our estimates of the cost-effective trajectory to meet the fifth 
carbon budget.

Cars 

Emissions from cars increased by 1.2% in 2015 to 69.1 MtCO2e , whilst the cost-effective path 
requires a decrease of 2.0% (Figure 5.5): 

• Fleet average real-world car CO2 intensity (CO2 emitted per km driven) increased by 0.1% in
2015, compared to a 3.4% decrease in our indicator. Average car efficiency improved,
resulting in a 0.3% increase in fleet efficiency, which was offset by a reduction in biofuel
usage, which decreased fleet efficiency by 0.5%.

• Car km increased by 1.1% in 2015, with a further increase of 2.0% in 2016. This increase in
demand is comparable to expectations in our indicator.

Vans 

Van emissions increased by 4.2% in 2015 to 18.0 MtCO2e, compared with a 0.4% decrease in our 
indicator (Figure 5.6): 

• Demand is increasing rapidly, with an increase of 4.3% in van-km in 2015, against an increase
of 2.9% in our indicator.

• Reductions in CO2 intensity have slowed, with a decrease in fleet average van CO2 intensity of
0.1%, compared with a 3.2% decrease in our indicator. The reduction in biofuels led to a 0.9%
increase in fleet intensity, although improvements in average van efficiency contributed a
1.0% decrease in fleet intensity.

 HGVs 

HGV emissions increased by 4.5% in 2015 to 19.6 MtCO2e, against a 4.6% decline in our indicator, 
reflecting an increase in HGV-kms and a worsening CO2 intensity (Figure 5.7): 

• HGV-kms increased by 3.5% in 2015, but remained flat in 2016. HGV-kms driven remain 3.9%
above the CCC indicator in 2015.

• Average real-world fleet intensity (gCO2/km) increased by 0.9% in 2015 as a slight
improvement in fleet efficiency (contributing a 0.1% decrease in fleet intensity) was offset by
a fall in biofuels (contributing a 1% increase in fleet intensity).

Aviation and shipping emissions 

 Aviation 

Total domestic and international aviation emissions increased by 1% in 2015, to 34.8 MtCO2e 
(Figure 5.8). Most of the rise came from international emissions, which represent the vast 
majority of aviation emissions and which are not formally included in carbon budgets. 
International emissions rose by 1.5%. 

In 2015 passenger demand rose by 5.5% and the number of flights increased by 2.5%. That 
emissions only rose 1% suggests a range of efficiency improvements are likely to have limited 
the increase in emissions. These could include higher load factors (e.g. the number of 
passengers per flight increased by 3% in 2015 and is now 20% higher than in 2005), improved 
fuel efficiency of aircraft as new models enter the UK fleet, and/or changes in the route mix 
towards closer destinations. 

Shipping 

Total domestic and international shipping emissions fell 12% in 2015, to 9.9 MtCO2e. This 
continues the reduction seen in recent years, and emissions are now 29% below 2008 levels. The 
reduction came entirely from international emissions, which fell 16%. Domestic emissions rose 
by 5%. 

There is limited data available to explain the change in emissions, but imports of cargo fell 4% in 
2015. However, the number of ship movements increased by 1% and the average size of ship 
decreased by 0.4%. Since both of these changes would tend to suggest an increase in emissions,

other factors must have contributed to the fall in emissions. These could include falling ship 
speeds, improvements in fuel efficiency of ships, or changes in bunkering patterns (e.g. taking 
on more fuel at ports outside the UK, which would therefore not be counted towards UK 
emissions).

2. Progress in decarbonising surface transport

Recent progress in reducing surface transport emissions 

In this section we consider progress in developing policies to reduce emissions in surface 
transport, covering conventional vehicle efficiency, ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs), biofuels 
and measures to change travel behaviour.  

Progress in reducing emissions from road vehicles is slow, with new test-cycle CO2 intensity for 
cars and vans significantly higher than our indicator and the uptake of biofuels by energy 
lagging behind what is required (Table 5.2). 

We will be developing an assessment of the number of public chargers and rapid public 
chargers required to support the levels of electric vehicle uptake in 2030 in line with our cost-
effective path over the coming months. The research used in the development of these figures is 
described in Box 5.1.

Box 5.1. Electric vehicle charging infrastructure research 

The CCC has commissioned research to enable us to assess progress in the coverage and availability of 
the expanding electric vehicle public charging network. The work will assess how well the charging 
network satisfies demand for charging in 2016 and where further expansion is required in order to 
provide charging for the increased numbers of electric vehicles in our fifth carbon budget scenarios in 
2020, 2025 and 2030. Our research classifies charging infrastructure into the following functions and 
locations, each meeting a different requirement: 

• Private off-street home charging, which is determined by the proportion of electric vehicle owners
that have access to off-street parking and are able to install a charger.

• Public on-street home charging for those who do not have a dedicated parking space where a
charger can be installed and instead make use of an on-street charger near the home.

• Destination charging (e.g. shopping centres, car parks etc.) where the vehicle is charged while the




Chapter 5: Transport 117 

Box 5.1. Electric vehicle charging infrastructure research 

owner is undertaking some other activity such as shopping or leisure activities. 

• Workplace charging, where charging facilities are provided for employees.

• Park and ride charging.

• Specialist fleet charging for vehicles such as buses, taxis and council fleets, which is not likely to be
available to the public.

• Rapid charger hubs used solely for the purpose of gaining a charge in urban areas to top up the car
when unable to charge enough elsewhere.

• Inter-urban 'en route' rapid chargers where the electric vehicle user is undertaking a long journey
and needs to recharge at an intermediate location.

Two analytical models to estimate different charging needs have been developed to assess the 
required number and location of charging stations. This analysis is confined to publically available 
charging points (the model does not estimate on the numbers of private home charging points, 
workplace charging points for employees or charging points for specialist fleets such as buses or taxis). 

• Estimates of the number and type of charging points required for normal daily journeys within the
local area are provided for 50 areas across Great Britain. These charging points could be on-street,
at destinations, at park and ride sites or rapid charger hubs. Department for Transport data are
used to estimate the number of car vehicle trips with destinations in each of the local areas.

• The number and location of chargers required to enable electric vehicles to drive long distance
journeys is calculated by considering vehicle travel demand patterns across Great Britain. The
model considers the diversion required to reach the charging location, the average waiting time to
gain access to the charger, the charge time (which will be dependent on the charging rate and
battery size) and the cost of the charge in order to optimise the required number of chargers and
locations.

Improving conventional vehicle efficiency 

Cars and vans 

EU regulations apply to the average CO2 intensity of a manufacturer’s fleet of new cars and vans. 
Car regulations have been in place since 2009, with a target of 95 gCO2/km for new cars sold in 
2020/21. Van targets are 175 gCO2/km for 2017 and 147 gCO2/km for 2020.  
This policy has led to improvements in test-cycle CO2 intensity across all car segments since its 
introduction, although there is evidence of a growing gap between test-cycle emissions and 
those achieved in real-world driving conditions.  
The rate of progress in reducing average new car CO2 intensity has slowed, and there is a 
significant risk that the 2020/21 target will not be met (Figure 5.9): 
• New cars sold in the UK in 2016 had an average test-cycle CO2 intensity of 120.1 gCO2/km, a

decrease of 1.0% since 2015.53 This is below the EU 2015 target of 130 gCO2/km, but is the
lowest annual reduction since the regulations were introduced.

• This slower rate of improvement is partly due to a move towards larger vehicles, particularly
a shift from super-minis to dual-purpose vehicles in 2016. If the distribution in size bands had
not changed from 2015, the CO2 intensity reduction would have been 1.7%:

53 SMMT (2017) New Car CO2 Report.  




118 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap  |   Committee on Climate Change 

‒  The average CO2 intensity of new cars in all segments has reduced since the regulations 
were introduced, with decreases among medium sized cars slightly larger than others. 

‒ The majority of new cars sold are in the ‘supermini’ and ‘lower medium’ segments, with 
60% of the market, although there has been a marked shift towards dual-purpose 
vehicles with 50% growth in the past two years. 

• The EU wide new car average CO2 is 118 gCO2/km and must fall by 5.3% per year in the
remaining four years to meet the EU 2021/21 target of 95 gCO2/km.54 UK new car CO2
progress is slower and so must fall by 5.7% per year in the remaining four years to reduce
intensity to the same level, a rate of reduction never previously achieved in any single year. If
steady progress had been made since the regulations were introduced, a 4% reduction year
on year would have been required.

This shift towards higher emitting vehicles shows that it is important that fiscal incentives to 
purchase lower emission vehicles (such as Vehicle Excise Duty (VED)) are aligned with the new 
car regulations, so that both measures work together to reduce emissions. 

The average CO2 intensity of new vans was 173.7 gCO2/km in 2016, a decrease of 2.9% since 
2015, a larger reduction than the previous year (Figure 5.10). Whilst the 2017 target has already 
been met, the rate of reduction needs to accelerate to 4.1% per year for the remaining four years 
in order for the UK to reduce intensity to 147 gCO2/km (the EU wide target).55 

54 European Commission (2017)  https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/cars_en 
55 The EU average is below the UK average, at 164 gCO2/km(European Commission (2017). 
https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/co2-emissions-new-vans-sold-europe-continued-decrease-2016_en), meaning 
that the EU wide target can be met at a slower rate of improvement of 2.7%.

The gap between real-world and test-cycle emissions remains a concern, with evidence that real-
world emissions from new cars in the EU could be around 40% higher than on the official test-
cycle as measured by the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).56 The introduction of the new 
Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) later this year should reduce this 
gap but is not expected to close it entirely. Given the continuing risk this poses to delivering 
real-world emissions reduction, new car and van CO2 targets should be tested with the more 
stringent Real Driving Emissions (RDE) standard as soon as feasible, with more independent 
testing across Europe.  

HGVs 

There is no available measure of new HGV gCO2/km, as this is not currently regulated. However, 
the average real-world CO2 intensity of the UK HGV fleet has remained relatively flat over the last 
decade, and has increased in the past two years, which could reflect a shift to heavier vehicles. 
The tonnes carried per km by HGVs have also increased by 1.8%, which could reflect logistical 
efficiency improvements and/or the shift to heavier vehicles.  

Uptake of electric vehicles 

Supply of electric vehicles 

The number of electric car and van models available (including both plug-in hybrid electric 
vehicles and battery electric vehicles) has increased from 25 models in June 2015 to 38 in June 
2016 and 46 in June 2017, with electric vehicles now available in every market segment. The

number of battery electric vehicles available with over 200 miles of range (according to the 
NEDC test-cycle) has also increased to 3 models, with additional models expected to be released 
over the next year. Battery pack costs account for a significant proportion of the cost of both 
types of electric vehicles, and are falling faster than projected (Box 5.2). It is likely electric vehicles 
will become cost competitive with conventional vehicles earlier than previously estimated. 
Several large car manufacturers have now stated that they expect between 15-25% of sales in 
2025 to be electric vehicles.57   

Box 5.2. Electric vehicle battery costs 

In recent years, battery pack prices have fallen significantly faster than anticipated (Figure B5.1). 

Although information on the cost of batteries remains commercially sensitive, announcements by 
manufacturers such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors, as well as new estimates by consultancies, point 
to a decline in costs far greater than projected in the Committee's fifth carbon budget analysis.  

Consultants estimate that battery pack production costs will fall below $100/kWh before 2030, while 
manufacturers are now targeting 2025. Estimates for the Committee in 2015 were around double this. 

Batteries are a key component of the total cost of a battery electric vehicle, accounting for up to a third 
of total costs. With pack costs falling faster than projected, it is likely that EVs will become cost 
competitive with conventional vehicles earlier than previously estimated.

Uptake of electric vehicles 

Sales of electric vehicles increased in 2016 and early 2017, and are currently in line with our 
indicator (Figure 5.11): 

• 38,000 electric cars and vans were sold in 2016, representing 1.2% of car and van sales.
Electric car sales increased by 30% compared to 2015, whereas electric van sales increased by
13%. 

• Sales have continued to increase in the first quarter of 2017, with electric vehicles making up
1.4% of new car and van sales.

The Committee has emphasised the importance of a national charging network to enable an 
accelerated roll-out of electric vehicles. The number of publically available charging points for 
electric vehicles continued to grow in 2016 and early 2017: 

• The total number of publically available charging connectors of all types has increased from
10,000 in June 2016 to 12,800 in June 2017.58

• The rapid charger network has also expanded to 2,300 connectors in 700 locations in May
2017, compared with 1,800 connectors in 2015.

Biofuels 

Biofuel uptake has reduced or remained flat in recent years (Figure 5.12). The sustainability of 
biofuels is increasing: 

• Biofuels share of fuel sales decreased from 2.9% in 2014 to 2.3% by energy in 2015 and
remained constant in 2016. This is lower than our indicator of 5.2% in 2016 based on the fifth
carbon budget assessment of the cost-effective path.

• Average GHG savings from biofuels increased to 74% (in 2015/2016) from 70% (in
2014/2015) by volume, excluding emissions from indirect land-use change (ILUC).

• 60% of all biofuels by volume were from waste feedstocks in 2015/16, slightly higher than
the previous year. Waste derived biofuels are double-counted towards the Renewable
Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) target of 4.75% by volume, so there is an increasing gap
between the volume of biofuels counted towards this target (as over half the biofuels by
volume are counted twice) and the energy content of these fuels.

The energy content of biofuels drives emissions intensity in the fleet, rather than volumes that 
are double-counted towards the RTFO. Low biofuel uptake on an energy basis has therefore 
contributed to the lack of progress in reducing CO2 intensity in road transport in 2015 and 2016. 
Biofuel uptake is currently below levels required to reach 8% of fuel by 2020 by energy.

Demand-side measures 

Changing the travel behaviour of individuals and businesses can help reduce emissions through 
avoiding trips, using lower carbon forms of transport (such as walking, cycling and public 
transport) or altering driving styles. However, it is difficult to track overall progress in reducing 
demand.  

Active travel is walking or cycling as a means of getting to a destination, meaning that it could 
replace a car trip, as opposed to walking or cycling for pleasure or exercise. It is difficult to 
monitor changes in active travel at a national level as the measured statistics differ across the 
devolved administrations. England and Northern Ireland use the same methodology, whereas 
Scotland and Wales both differ.  

The number of bus journeys has fallen in Great Britain over the past few years, declining by 5% in 
December 2016 since the recent peak in January 2014. It is difficult to measure the impact of this 
reduction on the demand for car travel.  

There is evidence of slight improvements in logistical efficiency for freight, with empty running 
reduced by 0.7% and tonnes carried per km increased by 1.8% in 2015.  

3. Progress in reducing aviation and shipping emissions
Carbon budgets currently include emissions from domestic aviation and shipping. Emissions 
from international aviation and shipping (IAS) are, at present, formally excluded from carbon 
budgets but taken into account when budgets are set (i.e. the budgets are set to be on track to a 
2050 target which includes IAS emissions).  

Progress agreeing global policy covering IAS emissions has been slow. The International Civil 
Aviation Organisation (ICAO) agreed a global offsetting scheme in 2016 but the International 
Maritime Organisation (IMO) has made less progress:  

• Aviation. In October 2016 the ICAO agreed a global offsetting scheme for emissions from
international aviation. This will require operators to purchase offset credits to cover
emissions growth above 2020 levels.

‒ The scheme will start in 2021, is voluntary until 2027, and currently ends in 2035. There is
provision to review and extend the agreement but it does not have an explicit long-term 
objective or link to the goals of the Paris Agreement.  

‒ Available estimates suggest that the scheme will cover less than half of total international 
aviation kilometres flown in 2030, given that it only covers emissions above 2020 levels 
and given available exemptions (e.g. for some developing countries and countries that 
have a small proportion of total kilometres flown). 

‒ A range of factors are still to be agreed including the rules for monitoring, reporting and 
verifying emissions, and the criteria for offset eligibility. The process for this is underway 
at ICAO for these to be agreed before the start of the scheme. 

‒ It is important that data to monitor compliance with the agreement are available when 
details of the scheme have been agreed. 




124 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap  |   Committee on Climate Change 

• Shipping. In October 2016 the IMO adopted mandatory requirements for large ships to
record and report data on their fuel consumption. This broadly aligns the IMO with the EU’s
approach, which is also to introduce a monitoring and reporting system for CO2 emissions.
The IMO also approved a roadmap for developing a strategy to reduce emissions from ships.
The aim is for an initial strategy to be adopted in 2018, with adoption of a revised version in
2023 to take into account the new available data from reported fuel consumption, and
further consideration of measures required.

In the context of future UK policy and infrastructure investment decisions, appropriate long-
term assumptions for government planning are for aviation emissions to be around 2005 levels 
in 2050 (implying around a 60% increase in demand over the same period), and for shipping 
emissions to be around one-third lower than 2010 levels. Government should publish an 
effective policy framework for aviation emissions on this basis. If aviation emissions are 
anticipated to be higher than 2005 levels – as in the central case in the business case for an 
additional runway at Heathrow airport – then other sectors would have to plan for 
correspondingly higher emissions reductions. We would expect to see this reflected in the 
Government’s plan for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets. 

These planning assumptions should be regarded as proxies for outcomes under long-term 
international agreements. The Government should therefore continue to push for rapid 
agreement of strong international policies - and implementation plans - consistent with long-
term climate goals. These will be required to unlock the full range of abatement potential whilst 
limiting risks of competitive distortions.  

4. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
Effective policy to meet future legislated carbon budgets must cover efficiency improvements 
for new cars, vans and HGVs, action to increase electric vehicle uptake, greater use of sustainable 
biofuels, action to increase walking, cycling and the use of public transport to limit demand for 
car travel and freight efficiency improvements through a shift to rail, eco-driving measures and 
improved logistics.  

Ultra-low emission vehicles 

Progress has been made by the Government in providing support for the higher costs of electric 
vehicles across a greater variety of vehicle types and in developing the infrastructure required: 

• Upfront grants remain available to support the purchase of several different types of electric
vehicles. Fully electric cars are eligible for a grant of £4,500, whilst plug-in hybrid cars can
apply for a reduced grant of £2,500. The government has committed to maintain these rates
until at least October 2017. These incentives are approximately in line with those offered by
other countries (Table 5.3).

• The Plug-in Van Grant gives a discount of up to £8,000 for electric vans of up to 3.5 tonnes
and was extended in October 2016 to cover larger electric vans above 3.5 tonnes. These vans
are eligible for grants of up to £20,000. This grant will be reviewed in March 2018 or when
5000 vans have been ordered (whichever comes first). By December 2016, 3,000 vans eligible
for the grant had been sold.

• A Plug-in motorcycle grant was introduced in October 2016, with zero emission motorcycles
and scooters now eligible for a grant of £1,500.




Chapter 5: Transport 125 

• The Government committed around an additional £300 million of support for ultra-low
emissions vehicles and renewable fuels in the 2016 Autumn Statement. This included:

‒ £80 million for ULEV charging infrastructure used by the Office for Low Emission Vehicles
(OLEV) to fund chargers at homes and workplaces. In addition, OLEV is working with 
councils to provide funding for on-street residential charging.  

‒  £150 million in support for low emission buses and taxis including the provision of 
supporting infrastructure. The Plug-in Taxi Grant will give taxi drivers up to £7,500 off the 
price of a new vehicle and dedicated charging points for taxis will be installed in 10 
council areas.  

‒ £20 million for the development of alternative aviation and heavy goods vehicle fuels.

Ultra-low emission vehicles were identified as an industry where the UK has a competitive 
advantage in the Industrial Strategy Green Paper.59 In the 2017 Spring Budget, the Industrial 
Strategy Challenge Fund allocated £246 million over four years to help UK businesses seize the 
opportunities presented by the transition to a low-carbon economy, including the design, 
development and manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles. The UK Government have 
invested £80 million in a £325 million plant producing electric taxis and work vans near 
Coventry. From 2018, all new London taxis must have a minimum electric range of 30 miles. Sir 
Mark Walport (Government Chief Scientific Adviser) is reviewing whether the Government 
should set up a new research institution to work on battery technology, energy storage and grid 
technology.  

HGV emissions 

There is currently no legislation covering CO2 emissions from HGVs. In May 2017, the EU agreed 
that truck manufacturers would be obliged to measure their fuel consumption with the VECTO 
tool, from 2019 onwards.60 This is designed to increase transparency of fuel and CO2 efficiency 
for new trucks, and should be used as the basis for setting new vehicle CO2 standards in this 
sector in the future.  

Cycling and walking 

The Cycling and Walking Investment strategy has set objectives for increasing walking and 
cycling. Cycling and walking will be measured in stages, where a stage is a section of a trip. This 
means that cycling or walking to another form of transport will be included, even if they are not 
the main form of transport. The Government has set the following cycling and walking targets to 
2025: 

• Doubling cycling activity from 0.8 billion stages in 2013 to 1.6 billion stages in 2025.

• Increasing walking activity to 300 stages per person per year in 2025.

60 European Commission JRC Technical Reports (2016) Report on VECTO Technology Simulation Capabilities and Future

Chapter 5: Transport 127 

• Increasing the percentage of children aged 5 to 10 who usually walk to school from 49% in
2014 to 55% in 2025.

The Government should develop a set of indicators to track progress and assess the impacts on 
car travel of policies to promote cycling, walking and public transport. 

Air quality 

The new draft UK Air Quality plan gives responsibility for improving air quality to local 
authorities and does not specify additional Government plans for action at a national level, 
making it difficult to assess the impact of the plan on transport GHG emissions.61 The plan states 
that diesel vehicles are the largest source of nitrous oxide emissions in the local areas of greatest 
concern. Diesel cars typically emit less CO2 than equivalent petrol cars, with new diesel cars in 
2016 emitting 3% less CO2 per km than petrol cars. Actions to combat air quality could result in a 
consumer shift from diesel to petrol cars, although under the latest Euro 6 standards, the NOx 
emissions of petrol and diesel cars are at their lowest ever levels and are approaching parity.62 
Our analysis for the fifth carbon budget suggested that even a large shift away from diesel cars 
would not have a significant impact on CO2 emissions provided it is coupled with a longer term 
shift to electric vehicles. There are options for local authorities to consider that would reduce 
emissions from transport including: 

• Local authorities should consider buying electric vehicles for their fleets and encouraging
local transport operators to do the same.

• Adequate charging infrastructure should be installed to encourage the uptake of electric
vehicles by private consumers.

• Public transport, cycling, walking, park and ride schemes and car sharing should all be
encouraged.

Areas where additional action is required 

There are several important areas that current Government policy does not cover and where 
there are significant risks of under-delivery. These must be addressed in the Government’s 
proposals for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets: 

• CO2 intensity standards to 2030 on a real-world basis for new cars (60 gCO2/km), vans (80
gCO2/km) and HGVs should be negotiated at an EU-level or introduced for the UK. These
should be introduced as soon as possible to provide the motor industry with greater
certainty. It is likely the design of new vehicles sold into the UK will continue to comply with
future EU standards, but manufacturers could shift to marketing and selling larger, less
efficient vehicles in the UK if their UK sales do not count towards the EU target and there is
no equivalent UK legislation. This could include fewer electric vehicles, particularly if the
supply of these is capacity constrained. Realistic testing procedures should be used to
measure compliance with the standard.

• The take-up of electric vehicles needs to accelerate to reach around 9% of market share in
2020 and 60% by 2030 (a mixture of both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles). Although it is now anticipated that electric vehicles will become cost-effective
earlier than previously expected due to reductions in battery costs, financial incentives for

128 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap  |   Committee on Climate Change 

electric vehicles should continue whilst they remain more expensive than conventional 
vehicles from a consumer perspective. As an alternative to grant funding, a reform to vehicle 
taxation with much steeper differentiation bewteen the lowest and higher emitting cars 
could provide much stronger incentives for both plug-in hybrids and battery electric 
vehicles. Any phase out of support for upfront costs should be staged and announced as 
early as possible, so as not to adversely affect the emerging market.  

• Fiscal incentives (e.g. Vehicle Excise Duty) should be aligned with CO2 intensity standards to
ensure that they both work to incentivise the purchase of more efficient conventional
vehicles and electric vehicles.

• A national publically available charging network must be developed, including both rapid
chargers for long inter-urban trips and destination chargers (e.g. at retail locations, public car
chargers and park and ride sites). Private investment is likely to continue to expand the
network, but public investment may be required in locations that aren't currently
commercially viable. A strategy for delivering on-street residential charging infrastructure is
required for drivers without access to off-street parking, in order to enable them to choose
an electric vehicle.

• The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation should be increased to 8% of transport fuel
demand by energy by 2020, with strong sustainability standards and should be extended to
2030. As this policy was introduced to contribute to the UK's target under the EU Renewable
Energy Directive, outside the EU the UK should either adopt targets domestically or develop
alternative approaches that deliver equivalent emissions reduction.

• Sustainable travel schemes promoting walking, cycling and public transport should be
evaluated and extended if they provide cost effective emissions reductions. National and
local policies should be used to reduce car km driven by 5% below the baseline scenario.
These policies could include:

‒ Investment in cycling, walking and public transport infrastructure

‒ Travel planning services and information campaigns

‒ Car clubs, which can make it easier for individuals to choose not to own a car

‒ Better land-use planning to provide easy access to public transport infrastructure.

• The impact on emissions of funding for new roads and road improvements should be
carefully assessed. The Government announced £1.1 billion of investment in local roads and
public transport networks in Autumn Statement 2016 and should take action to ensure that
this does not lead to increased demand above our recommended trajectory.

• Emissions from road freight should be reduced by training drivers to drive more efficiently,
more efficient logistics, retrofitting existing vehicles with fuel saving technologies and
shifting to less carbon intensive modes such as rail.

Current and planned policies are aiming to reduce domestic transport emissions from 121 
MtCO2e in 2016 to 110 MtCO2e in 2030, but have delivery risks and there remains a gap between 
anticipated emissions and our cost-effective path (Figure 5.13): 

• We identify risks with successful delivery of many of these policies, including car, van and
HGV fuel efficiency policies, planned policy to increase the usage of biofuels to 8% of
transport fuel by energy by 2020 and rail electrification.




Chapter 5: Transport 129 

• Even with the delivery of full emissions reductions from announced policies, reductions
would fall short of our cost-effective path by around 42 MtCO2e in 2030, delivering less than
40% of the required abatement.

Our assessment of policies to drive abatement options in the transport sector is shown in Table 
5.4. 

Until these areas are addressed there will remain a policy gap to the fourth and fifth carbon 
budgets and therefore the requirements of the Climate Change Act (sections 13 and 14) will 
remain unmet.

Key messages and recommendations 

Agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 49 MtCO2e in 2015, unchanged from the 
previous year, and represent 10% of UK GHG emissions. The land use, land-use change and 
forestry sector continued to be a net carbon sink, sequestering 7 MtCO2e in 2015, but the pace 
of removals is declining due to the ageing profile of trees. Stronger policies are required to 
meet England and devolved administration ambition for these sectors to 2020 and beyond. 

Our key messages are: 

• Agriculture emissions. There has been little change in emissions over the past six years
and no change in 2015 from the previous year. The share of emissions reached a high of
10% in 2015, reflecting the slow rate of progress in reducing the sector's emissions and the
faster pace of decarbonisation in other sectors.

• Emissions intensity. Since 2009, there has been no real improvement in the emissions
intensity associated with growing crops (CO2e/crop output), and there was a deterioration
in 2015. In contrast, livestock emissions intensity (CO2e/livestock output) has improved:

‒ N2O intensity of crops increased by 2.7% in 2015 as crop output fell faster than N2O
emissions. The opposite was the case for N2O livestock intensity which improved by 6%. 

‒ Methane intensity improved by 2% in 2015 as livestock output increased more than 
emissions. 

• Indicator framework. Agriculture non-CO2 emissions are above our indicators for the
second successive year. Emissions are not on track to meet carbon budgets.

• Land use and forestry emissions. The amount of net carbon sequestered was broadly
unchanged in 2015 at 7MtCO2e. Future sequestration is at risk from the ageing profile of
trees and the low level of new tree planting.

• Progress in developing policies. Significant gaps remain in establishing an effective
policy framework to deliver required emissions reductions in both sectors:

‒ Agriculture emissions. The UK agriculture sector is not on track to deliver the agreed
level of ambition for a reduction of 3 MtCO2e in England (4.5 MtCO2e in the UK) by 2022. 
Defra has indicated it will not move beyond the voluntary approach to reducing 
emissions in this period, putting at risk this level of abatement and the cost-effective 
path to 2030 set out in the fifth carbon budget.  

‒ Smart Inventory: Uncertainty in current agricultural emissions estimates is high relative 
to other sectors, making it difficult to assess mitigation options effectively. Defra work in 
developing the Smart Inventory would significantly improve this, and should be 
implemented without further delay. 

‒ Afforestation: England and the devolved administrations have targets for woodland 
creation which, if achieved, are sufficient to meet our trajectory to 2030. However, 
progress to date remains short of the ambition and continued efforts are needed to 
address barriers.  

• Leaving the European Union. Defra and the devolved administrations must consider what
replaces the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) once the UK leaves the EU. The current CAP
should be replaced with a UK based policy framework that links support more closely to the
reduction of emissions and increase in sequestration in agriculture, forestry and other land
use sectors.

Introduction 
In this chapter we assess current trends in agriculture and land use sector emissions and review 
progress towards meeting carbon budgets. We outline policy priorities needed to deliver the 
cost-effective level of abatement identified in these sectors to 2030, and the opportunities that 
these present in adapting to climate change.  
We summarise the analysis that underpins our key messages and recommendations in the 
following four sections: 
1. Agriculture emissions trends and drivers
2. Progress in reducing emissions in agriculture
3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
4. The land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector

1. Agriculture emissions trends and drivers
Emissions trends 

Agricultural GHG emissions were 49 MtCO2e in 201563, unchanged from the previous year. The 
sector’s share of UK GHG emissions reached a high of 10%, which reflects both the slow rate of 
progress in reducing the sector's emissions, and the faster pace of decarbonisation elsewhere in 
the economy. Most emissions (56%) are methane, 33% are nitrous oxide (N2O) mainly from soils 
and 10% are carbon dioxide (CO2) from mobile and stationary machinery (Figure 6.1). Although 
over the longer term emissions in this sector have been declining, since 2009, emissions across 
all main gases and sources have increased, and overall GHG emissions have risen by an annual 
average of 0.3% (Figure 6.2). This trend needs to be reversed to deliver the cost-effective 
reduction in emissions of 17% from 2015 to 2030.

A breakdown of emissions in 2015 by gas and source shows slight changes compared to the 
previous year and from 2009 (Figure 6.3). Absolute changes in this sector are not large and may 
not be statistically significant given the relatively high uncertainty in this sector (14%64): 

• The largest change was a fall in N2O emissions of -0.2 MtCO2e in 2015. These emissions are
mainly due to agricultural soils and emissions from this source also declined by a similar
amount.

• Methane emissions increased by 0.1 MtCO2e due to rising emissions from enteric
fermentation and waste and manure management.

• CO2 from combustion and the application of lime and urea to soils rose by 0.1 MtCO2e.

As annual changes can be affected by weather and other one-off factors, changes over a longer 
period are more indicative of trends in the sector. Since 2009, N2O and methane emissions have 
increased by an annual average of 0.4% and 0.3% respectively, as have most sources related to 
these emissions - soils, enteric fermentation and manure management. Since 2009 CO2 
emissions have decreased by an annual average of -0.2%, largely due to reductions in lime and 
urea applied to land. 

In the next section we discuss the drivers of changes of emissions.

Estimating emissions in the agriculture sector is subject to more uncertainty than most other 
sectors of the economy due to the complexity inherent in biological processes65. While ongoing 
improvements to the methodology under the GHG Research Platform have been made, Defra 
must ensure that the new Smart Inventory is rolled-out next year. The new inventory will reduce 
uncertainty and enable better monitoring of progress in meeting carbon budgets and farming 
practices that reduce emissions in this sector. 

Emissions drivers 

Nitrous oxide 

The vast majority of N2O emissions are from agricultural soils, two-thirds of which are from 
fertiliser application and crop residues. N2O emissions decreased by 1.8% in 2015 due to a 
reduction in inorganic fertiliser use. This is against the longer term trend where N2O emissions 
increased by an annual average of 0.4% since 2009: 

• Emissions from inorganic fertiliser declined by 5.4% in 2015 as usage on grasslands
decreased by 6%, while rates remained unchanged on arable land.

• Other sources of N2O emissions such as incorporation of crop residues into soils and
application of sewage sludge were largely unchanged.

• The longer term trends are not consistent with this pattern. Since 2009, crop-related N2O
emissions have risen by 0.8% on an average annual basis, while those on grasslands have
declined by 0.2%. This is largely due to increases in inorganic fertiliser use on crops and
decreases on grasslands.

The different pattern of fertiliser use on cropland and grasslands largely explains an 
improvement in N2O emissions intensity on grasslands but not on cropland. This is explored 
in more detail in the next section.  

Crops 

Emissions and emissions intensity of crops have shown no real improvement since 2009, as a 5% 
increase in crop output has been almost matched by an increase in fertiliser use. In 2015 N2O 
emissions associated with growing crops fell but output reduced further, leading to an increase 
in the emissions intensity of crops (Figure 6.4):  

• Following record yields in 2014, crop output fell back in 2015 by 3%. However, levels still
remained high when compared to most of the period since 2009.

• N2O emissions associated with growing crops decreased by around 0.5%. This can be
attributed to a 1% decline in the total area of land planted with arable crops and an
unchanged application rate of inorganic fertiliser which combined to reduce total nitrogen


use.


With crop output declining at a faster rate than associated emissions, the N2O emissions 
intensity of crop output increased by 2.7% in 2015.

An effective nutrient management plan can help minimise emissions from crop production as 
well as deliver other benefits such as reducing diffuse water pollution and improving 
biodiversity which are also important for adapting to climate change. According to survey 
data66:  

• In 2015, the proportions of cereal and other crop holdings in England with a nutrient
management plan were high at 88% and 83% respectively. While these are slightly higher
than the previous year, these proportions have been in the 80-85% range since 2011.

• There was mixed reporting of the proportion of holdings taking action to reduce GHG
emissions, with a rise among cereal farms and a decrease for other crop holdings in 2015.

• For those taking action to reduce emissions, there was also a clear association with farmers
believing this was best business practice and improved profitability.

The data indicate that there is limited scope to further roll-out nutrient management plans and 
that other measures will be needed to reduce crop-related N2O emissions.  

Livestock 

In contrast to the increase in crop-based emissions, N2O emissions associated with livestock have 
fallen by 1% since 2009. This has been associated with an 11% increase in output and a similar 
improvement in intensity (Figure 6.5).  

This improvement continued in 2015, with the N2O emissions intensity of livestock products 
down by almost 6%: 

• Livestock output increased for the third successive year, with levels up 2.5% in 2015. Output
increased across all meat and non-meat products. For example, milk output reached a 30
year high in 2015, as the dairy herd increased by 2% and average milk yields by 1%, to 7,994
litres per dairy cow.

• N2O emissions associated with livestock declined by 3.6% as the application rate of inorganic
fertiliser on grassland fell by 7%. This more than offset the much smaller increase in
emissions from grazing returns due to the increase in cattle numbers.

There remains scope to further reduce fertiliser related emissions in the livestock sector. For 
example: 

• Only 30% of grazing livestock farmers in England reported possessing a crop nutrient
management plan from an accredited FACTS67 advisor, compared to around 90% of arable
farmers.

• Of those who responded to the 2015 Farm Practices Survey, those holding a nutrient
management plan only covered 43% of the land area for grazing livestock in the lowlands.

• Planting clover mix on grasslands can help fix nitrogen in soils, but in 2015 the proportion of
temporary grasslands holdings using a clover mix reduced from 78% to 74%.

The industry's Greenhouse Gas Action Plan (GHG Action Plan) should consider how barriers to 
uptake amongst livestock farmers can be addressed so that they can better manage their 
fertiliser requirements. For example, over 1,000 plus Feed Advisers (on the Feed Adviser

Register) are engaging with livestock farmers - who aren't necessarily being reached by FACTS 
advisers - in order to boost their knowledge on improving grass and forage nutrient 
management efficiencies.

Methane 

Enteric fermentation arising from the digestive process of ruminants (e.g. cattle and sheep), and 
the management of livestock waste and manures account for almost all of the methane emitted 
in agriculture. Cattle accounted for 79% of methane emissions and sheep 16% in 2015. 

Since 2009, methane emissions have increased by 2% but output increased by 11% leading to a 
reduction in emissions intensity of 8%. Intensity continued to improve in 2015 as productivity 
improved (Figure 6.6): 

• Livestock output rose by 2.5% in 2015, and was accompanied by productivity gains as
measured by milk yields, and average dressed carcase weights (the latter up 1.6% for steers
and heifers and 1% for clean sheep).

• Methane emissions increased by 0.4% due primarily to a 2% increase in the beef and dairy
herd, which more than offset a 1% decline in sheep numbers.

These factors combined to improve methane intensity of livestock in 2015 by 2%, continuing the 
longer term de-coupling of output and emissions.

UK, and CCC calculations. 

The improvement in methane intensity has been achieved despite other indicators associated 
with livestock performance showing little change since 2011. Of those that responded to the 
England Farm Practices Survey: 

• 71% of farmers had a Health Plan in 2015, unchanged since 2011.

• 73% had a ration formulation programme or expert nutritional advice, slightly lower than
2011. 

• The proportion of farms using high Profitable Lifetime Index (PLI) when breeding cows and
Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs) to estimate genetic traits in meat production remained
broadly unchanged since 2011.

Despite this, the de-coupling of methane emissions from output suggests that emissions 
intensity of livestock has been reduced at the same time as increasing output and productivity 
as measured by higher average dressed carcase weights for meat and milk yields. However 
productivity gains do not always translate into overall emissions reduction if for example, 
livestock numbers increase.  

Going forward deeper reductions in agricultural emissions will be required to meet future 
carbon budgets which imply an 18% reduction in GHG emissions compared to 2015, equivalent 
to a 1.3% annual reduction between 2015 and 2030. Our analysis for the fifth carbon budget 
identified a range of on-farm measures that could deliver this cost-effectively. The measures

target both non-CO2 and CO2 emissions from soils, livestock, waste and manure management, 
and machinery, saving an estimated 7.3 MtCO2e68 by 2030.  

Figure 6.7 provides an indication of the range of indicators we could use to track progress to 
2030. The CCC indicators will be updated as part of next year's Progress Report in light of the 
launch of the new Smart Inventory, which will include different farming practices that influence 
emissions.  

While our central scenario for the fifth carbon budget does not include abatement from 
demand-side measures by 2030, we note that diet change and reducing food waste will be 
needed to deliver deeper cuts in agricultural emissions beyond 2030. Therefore consideration of 
these options before 2030 will be required in order to prepare for their implementation.

68 This has been downscaled from our original assessment to take account of inventory improvements in measuring 
N2O emissions introduced in 2016. This had the effect of reducing N2O emissions in the sector, and therefore the 
abatement potential.

2. Progress in reducing emissions in agriculture
Defra has set an ambition for reducing non-CO2 emissions in the agriculture sector in England by 
3 MtCO2e by 2022 from 2007 levels, which scales up to 4.5 MtCO2e for the UK. In order to track 
progress against this ambition, we set indicators for total non-CO2 emissions, and trajectories for 
reducing emissions by gas and source.  

Agricultural emissions in 2015 were not on track against the trajectories (Figure 6.8): 

• Emissions for all three sources: enteric fermentation, agricultural soils and wastes are off-
track. Soils have the largest discrepancy, with emissions 9% higher than the trajectory in
2015. 

• The indicators by gas show that both methane and N2O emissions are well above the
indicator (6% and 5% respectively in 2015) and not in line with meeting the longer-term
cost-effective path in this sector.

Overall, our assessment for 2015 suggests that agricultural emissions are off track against our 
indicators. We do not judge this to be a temporary trend as emissions have been off-track for a 
few years. A continuation of this trend would have serious consequences for meeting carbon 
budgets and greater effort is now required to close the gap to ensure the 4.5 MtCO2e ambition is 
met. To achieve this will require annual emissions reduction of 1.5% to 2022.  

The launch of the new Smart Inventory next year will enable better monitoring of progress, and 
will allow us to update and extend our indicators to align with our fifth carbon budget trajectory.

Government review of the GHG Action Plan (2017) 

Agricultural policy is a devolved matter. The Government’s ambition for a 3 MtCO2 reduction in 
non-CO2 emissions in England between 2007 and 2022 is being delivered through a voluntary, 
industry-led approach as set out in the Greenhouse Gas Action Plan (GHG Action Plan).  

Defra published a review69 of the Plan's progress in reducing emissions earlier this year. The 
review represents the Government’s long standing commitment to assess the current voluntary 
approach to reduce emissions, and represents a follow-up to its first review published in 2012.  

The current review assessed the effectiveness of the Plan between 2012 and 2016. It concluded 
that while a good level of progress in reducing emissions had been made, the pace of reductions 
needs to ramp-up in order to meet the ambition of 3 MtCO2e of abatement by 2022:  

• Using survey data and the industry's own progress report to assess the uptake of mitigation
measures covered by the Plan, Defra estimates that 1 MtCO2e of annual abatement had been
delivered by 2016. Soil nutrient management was found to have delivered just under half of
this abatement.

• Looking ahead, further uptake of these measures plus the identification and deployment of
new measures are needed to meet the ambition by 2022.

Defra has indicated it will not move beyond the voluntary approach to reducing emissions to 
2022. Our assessment is that this approach is unlikely to deliver the level of abatement set out in 
the GHG Action Plan. Whilst at an economy-wide level the third carbon budget (to 2022) is likely 
to be met, under-delivery of abatement in agriculture will undermine future carbon budgets as 
this sector forms an increasing share of remaining emissions. Actions needed for the fourth and 
fifth carbon budgets are set out in section 3. 

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
In its review of the GHG Action Plan, Defra acknowledged that a ramp-up in abatement in 
agriculture is required in the 2020s and beyond. Measures cited as possible options included the 
development of new agri-technologies, novel production systems and innovative food products. 

However, in order to deliver these types of approaches, and the type of abatement measures we 
set out in our fifth carbon budget advice, effective policy must move beyond the current 
voluntary approach that is largely based on the provision of advice and information. As yet no 
policy announcement to reduce agricultural emissions post-2022 has been made, which means 
there are significant risks of under-delivery (Table 6.2). This must be addressed in the 
Government’s proposals for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets.  

As part of this, Defra and the devolved administrations must consider what replaces the 
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) once the UK leaves the EU70. Any replacement of CAP with a 
UK based policy framework should link farming support more closely to the reduction of 
emissions in agriculture.  

Until this is addressed there will remain a policy gap to the fourth and fifth carbon budgets 
(Figure 6.9), and the 17% emissions reduction required to meet the cost-effective path between 
2015 and 2030 will not be met.

In this year's Scottish draft Climate Change Plan71 , which sets out proposals and policies to meet 
targets to 2032, the Scottish Government highlighted the lack of progress in reducing emissions 
in agriculture to date. The Plan includes the following proposals: 

• By 2020, to work with farmers to increase awareness about soil pH testing and to complete
carbon audits, both of which can deliver reduced emissions and increased profitability.

• By 2030, raise knowledge and awareness amongst farmers on the nutrient value of improved
soil and implementing best practice in nutrient management and application.

The Committee will comment on the draft Plan in our progress report on Scottish climate 
change mitigation later this year.

4. The land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector

Emissions trends 

The use and change in use of different land types in the UK both sequesters carbon and releases 
GHG emissions. The main land categories are cropland, forestry, grassland, wetlands and 
settlements. The sector is currently a net sink which sequestered 7 MtCO2e in 2015, largely 
unchanged from the previous year. There has been a weakening in CO2 sequestration from 
forests in 2015 due to the age profile of trees, which has not been offset by new tree planting. 
This could affect future sequestration in the sector and reverse the longer-term trend from 1990 
of an increased net sink (Figure 6.10). 

The 2017 inventory has been significantly revised since last year, resulting in an upward shift in 
net emissions across all years:  

• Net emissions are now higher in all years since 1990 (for example, 5.5 MtCO2e and 3.2
MtCO2e higher in 1990 and 2014 respectively when comparing the 2016 and 2017 national
inventories).

• The sector became a net sink of emissions much later than previously estimated, in 2000
rather than 1991.

These changes are largely due to inventory improvements in the reporting of net emissions on 
forest land:  

• A revision to estimates of the forest land area in Great Britain that is larger than 0.5 hectares,
based on the National Forest Inventory (NFI) dataset.72 This has replaced the National
Inventory of Woodland and Trees used in previous inventories, which was found to have
under-estimated both the forest area and the numbers of trees.

• Estimates of small woods of between 0.1 and 0.5 hectares in size are incorporated for the first
time, following an assessment by the Forestry Commission.73 These small woods cover an
estimated 390,000 hectares in Great Britain and represent about 10% of total woodland area.

The net result of these two improvements is an increase in total estimated forested area and 
therefore carbon removals.  

There was a further change in the inventory to include a new soil carbon module for forested 
land.74 The impact of this is to take account of changes in carbon from soils and litter when new 
trees are planted. However, the methodology for estimating the carbon in litter is still being 
developed and it is likely that the level of sequestration of newly forested land is currently 
underestimated. This will be addressed in next year's inventory.

While these and other minor changes have reduced the range of uncertainty in estimating 
LULUCF emissions from ± 7.4 MtCO2e in 2014 estimates to ±6.4 MtCO2e in this year's inventory, it 
still remains the most uncertain of all sectors in the national inventory (86% at a 95% confidence 
level). This is because of the sector's complex biological processes. 

In a recent report75 we highlighted the need to prioritise inventory improvements in the sectors 
with the highest uncertainty. Work by BEIS is underway to develop a more accurate and 
repeatable way to track land-use change in a spatially-explicit way. This should not only help to 
improve GHG emissions estimates in this sector, but is also needed for the analysis of land-use 
and how this relates to resilience impacts. 

Progress in reducing net emissions and policy progress towards the fourth and fifth 
carbon budget 

A range of options can increase carbon sequestration and reduce the release of emissions in this 
sector. For our fifth carbon budget abatement estimates, these options focus on the planting of 
more trees.  

Forestry 

New tree planting has fallen in recent decades, down by 85% in 2010 compared to levels in 
1989. We have previously recommended that the rate of tree planting in the UK should be 
increased by an additional 15,000 hectares annually between 2015 and 2030 in order to deliver 
1.8 MtCO2e76 of savings by 2030.  

England and the DAs have all set out plans to increase woodland cover which, if achieved, would 
meet our recommendation. Progress to date however, has been short of the ambition, with UK 
tree planting levels reaching only 5,500 and 6,400 hectares in the years to end March 2016 and 
2017 respectively. This represents a sharp decline on the 10,300 hectares achieved in 2015 and 
partly reflects the slow take-up of the new Rural Development Programme (RDP), which started 
in 2015.  

This slow-down has been particularly acute in England. In the last two years, tree planting rates 
have slumped due to the low uptake of funding available under the RDP's Countryside 
Stewardship (CS) scheme, the main source of public funding and the lack of traction with the 
new Woodland Carbon Fund:  

• The Countryside Stewardship scheme. Tree planting has fallen sharply under the first two
years of the new RDP77 from 1,782 hectares in 201478 (under the previous RDP) to just 546
hectares in 2015 and 525 hectares in 2016. This large decline is attributed to the more
onerous process of applying for funding under the current CS scheme, which has resulted in
interested parties dropping out of the application process. The recent enquiry by the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) Committee on the role of Defra in supporting the
forest economy79 concluded that the CS scheme was 'not fit for purpose', citing the 'complex
and overly bureaucratic' grant application process as a key barrier to increasing woodland

cover. They called for a return to a one-stop shop for forestry grants in order to simplify the 
process. 

• The Woodland Carbon Fund. The 2015 Spending Review promised £19 million for
woodland creation until 2020. Launched in November 2016, take-up has been slow as
reflected by the number of applications to date. Potential applicants may be deterred from
applying as the Fund only provides capital funding for the cost and planting of trees, but not
ongoing maintenance, unlike the CS scheme.

We recommend that Defra addresses these issues as soon as possible in order to ensure that its 
ambition to increase woodland cover to 12% by 2060 is not further obstructed.  

Integrating trees and shrubs in agricultural production (Agroforestry) 

In our advice on the fifth carbon budget, we use the term agroforestry to mean the integration 
of trees or shrubs into a sustainable production system on arable land and grasslands. Our 
scenarios focus on a relatively low level of uptake to achieve some low-cost abatement between 
now and the fifth carbon budget. The extent of this uptake will depend on the development of 
measures to address current financial and non-financial barriers. In future work, we will consider 
whether more cost-effective abatement opportunities exist for agroforestry in the UK. 

Our fifth carbon budget estimates include 0.6 MtCO2e of abatement in 2030. Our estimates only 
include the carbon benefits of growing trees and do not take account of other potential benefits 
such as the reduction of N2O emissions through reduced fertiliser use. The level of savings 
included in our assessment corresponds to around an additional 0.6% of UK agricultural land 
area on top of the 1% of land that is currently used for hedgerows and shelter belts. This serves 
as a useful proxy for broader agroforestry activities in the absence of any official estimates. 

We have previously cited the lack of information for land owners and managers about 
integrating trees and shrubs onto agricultural land and the associated benefits as key barriers to 
uptake. Defra is conducting a review of agroforestry, which is considering the evidence base, the 
barriers to uptake and how it could operate within the RDP. It will be helpful for this to be 
published as soon as possible. While agroforestry benefits have been recognised at the EU level, 
and farmers in some member states such as Scotland and Wales are able to receive funding 
under Pillar II of the CAP to plant trees, and receive subsidy payments, farmers in England are not 
able to do so.  

In its draft Climate Change Plan80, the Scottish Government is looking to develop policy to 
increase trees and hedgerows planted on agricultural land. Suggested mechanisms to increase 
planting include payment for carbon sequestration and the setting of woodland targets on 
agricultural land.  The Committee will consider the draft Plan in our progress report on Scottish 
climate change mitigation later this year. 

In addition to planting more trees for carbon sequestration, there are benefits to adapting to 
climate change such as alleviating the risk of downstream flooding. The CCC's Adaptation Sub-
Committee's (ASC) progress report81, also notes that planting a more diverse set of trees species 
is important as an adaptation strategy to improve resilience from the threats of pests and 
diseases.

150 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap   |   Committee on Climate Change 

Peatland 

Action is required to reduce carbon losses from degraded peat, albeit this is not included in our 
carbon budget estimates. We await the results of work by the Government to better quantify 
emissions estimates from both upland and lowland peat. This work will feed into next year's 
national GHG inventory, which will provide a full account of all sources of peatland emissions. 

Having established the baseline level of emissions, the next step will be to assess the abatement 
potential from restoration that could eventually contribute towards future carbon budgets.  
Data on peatland emissions in the lowlands should help inform how sustainable management 
practices can reduce degradation on cultivated soils. A current project (SEFLOS82) being led by 
Bangor University will assess the scope for a range of practices such as seasonal management of 
the water table and the use of cover crops to reduce GHG emissions and soil loss in the Fens. The 
project is expected to complete next year.  

In the meantime, a further £10 million of capital grants83 will be made available for peatland 
restoration in England between 2018 and 2021. Although details are yet to be finalised, funding 
in the form of a grant scheme is expected to support practical restoration initiatives and 
reducing emissions will be a key criteria in the assessment of bids. This £10 million follows an 
earlier £4 million of capital grants that is already funding restoration run by Natural England.  

In addition to the carbon benefits of restoring peatlands, there are positive links to efforts to 
adapt to climate change. These include enhancing water and soil quality as well as improving 
biodiversity. Recommendations set out in the ASC's 2017 Progress Report call on Defra to set out 
proposals to reverse the ongoing loss of lowland peat soils by 2019, and to target the restoration 
of all designated upland blanket bog habitats to good condition by 2030. 

Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets 

The cost-effective path set out in our fifth carbon budget included emissions savings of 2.4 
MtCO2e by 2030 from additional tree planting, including some on agricultural land. However, 
policies to deliver this abatement are currently not delivering or are absent (Table 6.3). 
Therefore, policies to deliver these saving must be addressed in the Government’s proposals for 
meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets. This should include replacement of CAP with a 
policy framework that links support more closely to the reduction and removal of emissions in 
forestry, peatland and other land use sectors by 2020. Until this happens, there are delivery and 
policy risks attached to the 2.4 MtCO2e of savings (Figure 6.11).

is to be reached. Land is unique in that it is the only sector at present to remove CO2 from the 
atmosphere, and coupled with the possibility of combining it with technologies such as carbon, 
capture and storage (CCS) it could deliver further negative emissions.  

It is against this background that we are exploring further how the use and management of land 
and livestock could deliver deeper emissions cuts and increased GHG removals in the UK 
agriculture and LULUCF sectors by 2100 as well as delivering benefits from adapting to climate 
change such as biodiversity and resilience to flooding. The Committee's Land Use Project has 
just completed a pilot phase in conjunction with the Environmental Change Institute (ECI) at 
Oxford University. The ECI work provided useful insights into how the warming climate alone 
could significantly change the use of land in the UK by 2050. Further work on the project will be 
published in due course.

Chapter 7: Waste 155 

Key messages and recommendations 

Emissions from waste totalled 18.4 MtCO2e in 2015, accounting for almost 4% of total UK greenhouse 
gases (GHG). They mainly comprise methane emissions from the decomposition of biodegradable 
waste in landfill sites in the absence of oxygen. 

Waste emissions data lag other sectors by a year due to the longer time required to collate non-CO2 
emissions data. In this chapter, we present the latest emissions data by GHG and source for 2015, the 
drivers of change and policy progress required to deliver the abatement needed to meet the fifth 
carbon budget.  

Our key messages are: 

• Emissions trends and drivers. Waste emissions fell by 7% in 2015, a slower reduction than in the
recent past as emissions fell by 11% on an annual average basis between 2009 and 2014. Since
1990 waste emissions have fallen by 73%. These reductions have mainly been due to reduced
biological waste going to landfill, investment in methane capture technology and improved
management at landfill sites.

• There is need for accurate data for wastewater emissions and the identification of further
abatement potential. Currently the GHG inventory estimates emissions of 4 MtCO2e from
wastewater treatment. This is based on high default values due to limited available data on
wastewater emissions and could be an overestimate.

• Indicator framework. Our progress indicators for the sector cover reduced material going to
landfill, and methane capture and flaring at landfill. All have been on track for 2015, which means
that the overall 69% decline in landfill emissions since 2007 is above our indicator decrease of 67%,

• Further policy strengthening will be required to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets.
Each nation must set specific actions and clear milestones to strengthen policy through the whole
waste chain, through: minimising waste arising, separate collection and diversion of biodegradable
waste from landfill. There may also be potential for further progress in avoiding the release of
methane emissions at landfill sites.

We will assess the Government's plan for meeting the gap in the fourth and fifth carbon budgets 
against the following check list (Table 7.1):

156 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap   |   Committee on Climate Change  

Introduction 
In this chapter we assess emissions trends in the waste sector and review progress towards 
meeting carbon budgets.  

We summarise the analysis that underpins our key messages and recommendations in the 
following three sections: 

1. Waste emissions trends and drivers

2. Recent progress in reducing emissions in the waste sector compared to required progress

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets

1. Waste emissions trends and drivers
Waste emissions are largely made up of non-CO2 gases, which are reported a year later than CO2. 
We therefore focus on 2015 emissions in this chapter. This section sets out the change in 
emissions from 2014 and in the recent past, and the main drivers of change. 

Emissions trends 

Waste emissions account for less than 4% of total UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Emissions declined by 7% to 18 MtCO2e in 2015, following an annual average decrease of 11% 
over the period 2009-2014. Over the longer term, emissions have declined by 73% since 1990 
(Figure 7.1). 

Waste emissions are predominantly methane (91%) which arise due to the decomposition of 
biodegradable waste in landfill sites in the absence of oxygen. Emissions also arise due to 
wastewater treatment, biological treatment and incineration of wastes:  

• Landfill emissions (12 MtCO2e) account for 67% of waste emissions and are entirely
methane. Landfill emissions fell by 11% in 2015, which is slightly lower than the 12% annual
average decrease over the period 2009-2014. Since 1990 they have fallen by 80% due to
reductions in biodegradable waste going to landfill, investment in methane capture
technology and improved management at landfill sites.

• Wastewater treatment emissions (4 MtCO2e) account for 22% of waste emissions. 83% are
methane and the remaining 17% nitrous oxide (N2O). Wastewater treatment emissions
increased for the second successive year, up 3% in 2015, which reverses the slight annual
average decline over 2009-2014. Since 1990 they have fallen by 18%.

• Biological treatment emissions (1.7 MtCO2e) are a mixture of methane and N2O from
industrial and domestic composting, anaerobic digestion of non-agricultural waste and
mechanical biological waste treatment (MBT). These account for 9% of waste emissions and
increased by 4% in 2015, as compared with an annual average increase of 10% over the
period 2009-2014.

• Incineration (without energy recovery) emissions (0.3 MtCO2e) account for 2% of waste
emissions which are mainly CO2. Incineration emissions fell by 2% in 2015, following an
annual average 1% increase over the period 2009-2014.

Given their dominance in waste emissions, we focus on methane emissions from landfill.

Waste emission drivers – methane from landfill 

Estimated methane emissions from landfill are based on: the quantity of biodegradable waste 
sent to landfill, assumptions on the properties of waste streams such as methane yield and 
decay rates, and the quantity of methane emissions avoided at landfill sites:  

• Biodegradable waste arising. New data published by the Waste Reduction Action
Programme (WRAP) this year84 suggests that, despite efforts to reduce food waste under
schemes such as the Courtauld Commitment85, the level of avoidable household food and
drink waste (i.e. that could have been consumed) in 2015 increased by 5% to 4.4 million
tonnes, compared to 4.2 million tonnes in 2012. The upturn is attributed to changing
economic conditions since the start of 2014 (e.g. decreasing food prices and rising wages in
real terms), which weakened the incentive for people not to waste food.

• Biodegradable waste sent to landfill. Although the amount of food waste increased in
2015, the amount of landfilled biodegradable waste reduced by 11%, the same reduction as
over the period 2009-2014. Biodegradable waste sent to landfill in 2015 has fallen by 84%
since 1990.

• Methane emissions avoided at landfill sites. Methane emissions at landfill can be avoided
by capture, flaring to CO2 and natural oxidisation. Estimates suggest that 68% of methane
emissions at landfill were avoided in 2015, rising from 45% in 2009 and 1% in 1990.

‒ The proportion of methane captured for use in energy generation (mainly for electricity) 
rather than emitted is estimated to have averaged 58% in 2015, rising from 41% in 2009. 
In 2015 this generated 4.9 TWh of electricity86 accounting for around 2% of total UK 
electricity generation.  

‒ Around 10% of the methane generated at landfill sites is estimated to have been flared in 
2015, rising from 4% in 2009. 

‒ Residual methane that is oxidised at the landfill site is estimated to have averaged 3% in 
2015, falling from 5% in 2009. 

Overall, estimated landfill methane emissions have fallen by 80% since 1990 (Figure 7.2).

Source: BEIS (2017) Final UK greenhouse gas emissions national statistics 1990-2015. 
Notes: Biodegradable waste and proportion landfill methane not avoided do not equal landfill methane 
emissions. Emissions also depend on methane yield from waste. 

The estimated uncertainty level of waste emissions in 2015 (18 MtCO2e) is high, around ± 39% at 
a 95% confidence interval compared with ± 2.7% for the economy as a whole. Uncertainty in 
landfill emissions is even higher at 48%.87 Given the dominance of landfill emissions in the waste 
sector, and as set out in our report on quantifying GHG emissions88, work should progress on 
addressing the uncertainties that exist in estimating emissions from this source. For example:

87 This is a 2014 estimate as 2015 uncertainty estimates for sub-sectors are not yet available.

Chapter 7: Waste 159 

• There is an imperfect understanding of the amount of methane emitted from various waste
streams and over how many years it is emitted. Field and experimental observations exhibit
wide variation (reflecting differences in how materials are mixed together, which affects
moisture content and access of waste streams to oxygen). The yield and decay rate are also
affected by real landfill conditions, which differ between and within sites.

• On fugitive emissions, Defra and the Environment Agency are working to better measure
these emissions from landfill sites. For example, the Environment Agency is ascertaining
whether the use of drones can accurately quantify a known release of methane emissions
from landfill.89 The results of this work could be used to develop additional site-specific data
on landfill methane emissions.

Our analysis suggests that between 2015 and 2030, waste emissions could fall by 53% to 8.5 
MtCO2e driven by measures to reduce landfill emissions. Our progress indicators for the sector 
cover reduced material going to landfill, and methane capture and flaring at landfill (Figure 7.3). 
In terms of policy actions, which we will also monitor, these should be driven by incentives to 
reduce household and commercial waste and incentives for landfill operators to capture 
methane. 

In the future, we may want to consider how abatement from the other sources, particularly from 
wastewater treatment, can contribute towards meeting carbon budgets.

2. Recent progress in reducing emissions in the waste sector compared
to required progress 
In this section we set out the opportunities to further reduce waste emissions and progress in 
developing policies to deliver these. We focus on the reduction of landfill emissions.  

Government policy to reduce landfill emissions has focused on reducing waste, diverting 
biodegradable waste from landfill and capturing the methane from landfill sites:  

• Waste prevention. Emissions can be further reduced through prevention, which also offers
substantial upstream environmental and economic gains associated with resource efficiency.

• Diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill. There is potential to go significantly
further in diverting biodegradable waste away from landfill and towards recycling,
composting, anaerobic digestion (AD), mechanical biological treatment (MBT) and
incineration with energy recovery.

• Landfill methane capture or flaring. Methane capture at modern landfill sites is over 80%
and can reach as high as 90%. These sites will play a bigger role as legacy emissions from
older (and less efficient) landfill sites decline.

Emissions reduction has occurred through a combination of information and voluntary 
programmes to prevent waste, a landfill tax to divert waste from landfill and investment in 
methane capture technology. Action is being taken at the EU level mainly through the EU 
Landfill and Waste Framework Directive and national, devolved administration and local 
authority levels. 

Our indicators reflect a scenario in our fifth carbon budget advice of prevention or diversion of 
five biodegradable waste streams (food, paper/card, wood, textiles and garden waste) from 
landfill, across the UK by 2030.90 Key indicators are on track for 2030 based on latest outturn data 
for 2015: 

• Emissions from waste sent to landfill fell by 69% from 2007 compared with our indicator
decrease of 67%.

• The amount of biodegradable waste sent to landfill has fallen by 69% since 2007, and is
outperforming our indicative value of a 57% reduction.

• The proportion of methane captured at landfill has been increasing steadily and at 68% in
2015 is above our indicator value of 63%.

Although recent progress has been on track with our indicator framework, steeper reductions 
will be required to meet the cost-effective path of 8.5 MtCO2e by 2030 set out in our Fifth Carbon 
Budget Report.  

The Landfill tax has been the key driver of progress to date. The tax has increased year-on-year 
to meet targets set by EU Directives to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and 
incentivise methane capture at landfill sites. By April 2016 it had reached £84.40/tonne 
compared to £82.60/tonne a year earlier.  

In addition to the landfill tax, waste prevention information, voluntary programmes, and 
regulations over landfill management have contributed to the overall reduction in landfill 
emissions.

Chapter 7: Waste 161 

In the devolved administrations, the landfill tax was devolved to Scotland from 1 April 2015 and 
is a key component of Scotland’s Zero Waste Plan. The rate set for 2016 matches that for England 
and by 2018 Wales will be able to set its own level. Other developments and proposals to reduce 
landfill emissions include: 

• Scotland. In this year's Draft Climate Change Plan91 the Scottish Government outlined its
intent to phase out biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill a year ahead of the
statutory ban that applies from 2021. By 2025 it wants the amount of waste sent to landfill to
fall to 5%. The Plan also indicated the need to better manage emissions from existing closed
and older operational landfill sites through innovative flaring technology. There is a target to
support 12 closed sites by 2022. The Committee will comment on the draft Plan in our
progress report on Scottish climate change mitigation later this year.

• Wales has the highest recycling rates in the UK (55% of municipal waste is reused,
composted or sent for recycling in 2014/15), and the fourth best in Europe, as a result of
meeting strong regulatory targets for waste reduction through the 'Towards Zero Waste'
strategy. The target is to have 70% of all wastes recycled by 2025, and reduce waste going to
landfill to 5% by the same timeframe.

Further detail is provided in Chapter 9 covering the devolved administrations. 

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
BEIS emissions projections suggest that waste emissions are expected to continue falling, albeit 
more slowly than in the past, without further policy, largely as a consequence of the landfill tax. 
In our fifth carbon budget advice, we estimated that stronger polices to divert biodegradable 
waste streams from landfill could reduce emissions by a further 4 MtCO₂e by 2030. However, 
there are no plans in place to achieve this. Delivery mechanisms through the waste chain are 
therefore required in order to meet our assessment of the cost-effective path (Figure 7.4).  

In last year's Progress Report, we cited the need for Government to publish specific actions and 
clear milestones to strengthen approaches through the waste chain; including separate waste 
collection, reducing biodegradable waste to landfill and improving methane capture rates at 
landfill sites where possible. This has not moved forward and must be addressed in the 
Government’s proposals for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets.  

We will publish our assessment of the Government’s proposals after they have been published.

Key messages and recommendations 

Fluorinated gases accounted for around 3% of total UK emissions in 2015. While F-gas emissions come 
from various applications, they are mainly used as refrigerants in air conditioning and refrigerators, and 
are typically released due to leakage from appliances. F-gas emissions are reported with a one-year lag 
compared to sectors where CO2 is the main source of GHG emissions.  

Our key messages for the F-gases sector are: 

• Emissions from F-gases in 2015 were broadly flat, which is short of the 2% fall in emissions
estimated to be cost-effective in our fifth carbon budget central scenario. The main cause was slow
progress in the reduction of aerosol emissions.

• Existing regulation is expected to reduce F-gas emissions substantially: The EU F-gas
Regulation, which came into force in 2015 together with enforcement measures, aims to cut
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) sales, the main source of emissions, by 79% from 2015 EU levels by
2030. It also introduces a series of new bans on the use of certain F-gases and strengthens checks
on leaks.

• There is likely to be potential for reductions to go further. Last year, we recommended that the
Government should review cost-effective opportunities to exceed regulatory minimums on F-gas
abatement. The Government has not made progress on this.

We will assess the Government's plan for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets against the 
following checklist (Table 8.1).

Introduction 
In this chapter we review progress in reducing F-gas emissions at domestic and international 
levels, as well as existing evidence on opportunities to reduce F-gas emissions further and the 
expected level of reduction by 2030. We summarise the analysis that underpins our key 
messages and recommendations in the following three sections: 

1. F-gas emissions trends and drivers

2. Progress in reducing F-gas emissions

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets

1. F-gas emissions trends and drivers

Background 

F-gas emissions were around 17 MtCO2e in 2015, accounting for around 3% of total UK GHG 
emissions (Figure 8.1). This share of total emissions has increased slightly since 2009. F-gas 
emission levels are 4% below 1990 levels.  

The main source of emissions is the leakage of F-gases from refrigeration and air-conditioning 
systems during their use, where F-gases are currently used as the main alternative to ozone-
depleting CFCs. Other F-gas emissions come from their use in aerosols and metered-dose 
inhalers, which are applied for respiratory disorders (e.g. asthma), as well as in fire-fighting 
equipment. 

F-gases are released in small amounts. However, they are very effective at trapping heat and 
some of them will remain in the air for many centuries after their release. As a result, they have a 
relatively high climate impact per molecule, which is reflected in the high Global Warming 
Potentials (GWPs) used in international emissions accounting. The four reported F-gases are 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen 
trifluoride (NF3): 

• HFC emissions (95% of the total) are used in refrigeration, air-conditioning appliances,
aerosols and foams, metered-dose inhalers and fire equipment. They are emitted during the
manufacture, lifetime and disposal of these products.

• SF6 emissions (3%) are mainly used in electrical insulation, magnesium casting and military
applications.

• PFC emissions (2%) result mainly from the manufacture of electronics and sporting goods.
They are also a by-product of aluminium and halocarbon production.

• NF3 emissions are currently very low and result from semi-conductor manufacturing.

Total F-gas emissions peaked in 1997, reaching 25 MtCO2e, when 80% of emissions were due to 
halocarbon production. Between 1997 and 2000, F-gas emissions dropped significantly as a 
result of the fitting of abatement equipment to the plants producing halocarbons. Since 2001, F-
gas emissions have been slowly rising again, mainly because of increasing use in air conditioning 
and refrigeration appliances (Figure 8.2).

Emission trends 

In 2015, F-gas emissions stayed broadly flat, following average annual growth of 0.4% between 
2009 and 2014. The main drivers behind these changes are demands for F-gases in refrigeration 
and air conditioning, together with the introduction of the 2006 EU F-gas regulation: 

• Stationary refrigeration (38% of the total). The main source of F-gases fell by 4% between
2014 and 2015. Emissions reached a peak of 7.9 MtCO2e in 2010 and showed an average 2%
reduction in the period 2009-2014. The decline after 2009 is likely to be the result of the 2006
EU F-gas Regulation that aimed to replace F-gases with high Global Warming Potentials
(GWPs) with lower-GWP refrigerants.

• Mobile air conditioning92 and refrigerated transport (24%). These increased by around
2% in 2015. This is in line with the average annual growth of 2% between 2009 and 2014.

• Stationary air conditioning (18%). These have been growing strongly recently: a 6%
increase in 2015 following 10% annual average growth over the period 2009-2014.

• Aerosols and metered-dose inhalers (11%). These decreased by around 3% in 2015, in line
with falls over the period 2009-2014, which have been driven by a fall in emissions from
aerosols.

• Firefighting, foams, electrical insulation and other. These rose by around 4% in 2015, but
were broadly flat over the period 2009-2014.

In summary, while emissions from some sources (i.e. mobile and stationary air conditioning) 
increased in 2015 in line with their long-term trend, emissions from refrigeration stayed flat. This 
is likely to reflect the impact of EU regulation to control F-gas emissions. 

2. Progress in reducing F-gas emissions

Cost-effective path to reduce F-gas emissions 

Reducing F-gas emissions cost-effectively, from around 17 MtCO₂e in 2015 to around 5 MtCO₂e 
in 2030, will require the use of alternatives to F-gases in most applications. Many applications 
already have cost-effective alternatives to F-gases available, while some of the alternatives need 
further development to be commercially viable: 

• Refrigeration and stationary air conditioning are most likely to have low-GWP refrigerants
available (e.g. existing hydrocarbons or CO2), which could reach 100% of sales by 2030 or
earlier.

• Mobile air conditioning can use lower-GWP alternatives to current F-gases in many cases,
although they are expected to have higher costs.

• Aerosol use of F-gases can be reduced by using lower-GWP alternatives, requiring small
modifications to equipment only.

• Metered-dose inhalers are medical aerosols used to dispense drugs used for lung diseases
such as asthma. There may be scope to reduce these emissions through low-GWP
alternatives. Dry powder inhalers are a known alternative used in many countries for over 20
years, but these are generally more expensive and are not suitable for all patients.

Chapter 8: F-gases 169 

In addition to tracking abatement for existing sources of F-gas emissions, the uptake of heat 
pumps within our scenarios for heat decarbonisation could imply potentially significant 
increases in F-gas emissions.93 It will therefore be important that heat pumps transition to using 
low-GWP refrigerants between now and 2030, after which deployment of heat pumps might 
accelerate considerably. Between now and 2030, heat pump uptake in our scenarios may add 
around 0.6 MtCO2e emissions by 2030 because of their use of HFCs as refrigerants, while saving 3 
Mt in emissions from fossil fuel combustion.94 

Figure 8.3 outlines changes to emissions in line with the central scenario from our fifth carbon 
budget, as well as expected policy drivers for this change. These changes reflect our 
understanding of the impacts of EU F-gas Regulation, which, if converted into UK law, would 
significantly reduce emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning. In future we will track 
progress in: Total F-gas emissions; Stationary refrigeration emissions; Mobile air conditioning 
and refrigerated transport emissions; Stationary air conditioning emissions; Aerosol emissions; 
Policy on F-gas regulations.

Current progress 

The level of F-gas emissions is below our indicator pathway to meet future carbon budgets. 
However, this is only because the estimate of F-gas emissions for our start year (2014) has turned 
out to be above the outturn (rather than equal to the level in the start year). Emissions from  
F-gases did not fall in 2015. This fell short of the 2% fall in emissions outlined by our indicator

pathway to meet future carbon budgets (Figure 8.4). The main reason for the slower rate of 
reduction in 2015 was that aerosol emissions did not fall as fast as their indicator pathway.  

Emissions from stationary refrigeration, mobile air conditioning and refrigerated transport, 
stationary air conditioning all fell at a rate in line with their indicator pathways. 

Overall, progress (Table 8.2) broadly shows emissions below the indicators, with stationary 
refrigeration emissions slightly above its indicator. However, the broad trend in emissions since 
2007 has been upwards and needs to be reversed. The rate of emissions reductions now needed 
to meet the indicator trajectory is quite steep, so considerable further progress is needed.

3. Policy progress towards the fourth and fifth carbon budgets
This section outlines current policies on F-gases in the UK and the requirements for the 
Government's plan to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets. 

UK policy 

There are two main EU policies that are driving reduction in F-gas emissions. These are the 
Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC) Directive and the 2015 F-gas regulation:  

• The MAC Directive focuses on emissions from air conditioning in new cars and vans, and has
been in force since 2011. It requires new types of cars and vans to use substances with a GWP
less than 150. It will require this for all new cars and vans produced from 2017.

• The F-gas regulation that came in to force in the UK in January 2015 introduced a number of
new measures and strengthened the measures in 2006 regulation:

‒ It caps the amount of HFCs that producers and importers are allowed to place on the EU
market. Incumbent producers receive maximum emission quotas based on the previous 
quantities produced. In 2015 the cap matched the average of the market between 2009 
and 2012. The allowed emissions will then be reduced incrementally, starting with a 7% 
cut in 2016 from the initial cap, stepping up to a 33% cut in 2018 and ultimately reaching 
a 79% cut by 2030. Some uses of HFCs are exempted from the regulation, including their 
use in metered-dose inhalers, manufacturing of semiconductors or military equipment. 

‒ The regulation introduces bans for some new equipment. These bans cover areas 
including domestic and imported refrigerators and freezers or air-conditioning systems. 
For example, domestic refrigerators and freezers have not been allowed to use 
refrigerants with GWP above 150 from 2015.95 

‒ The regulation introduced a new ban for the maintenance and servicing of existing 
refrigeration appliances which will not allow HFCs with a GWP above 2,500 from 2020.

172 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap   |   Committee on Climate Change  

‒ The regulation also strengthens existing obligations in terms of leak checking and 
repairs, F-gas recovery and technician training. 

The 2015 F-gas regulation aims to reduce GHG emissions from the use of HFCs. There is strong 
evidence showing that the phasedown of HFCs is cost-effective as most of the low-carbon 
alternatives are already available and are likely to deliver energy efficiency improvements in 
relevant appliances.96 The other F-gases are not part of the phase down but they are expected to 
be affected by the requirements of the regulation on leak checking, F-gases recovery and 
training. 

Our current cost-effective emission trajectory (Figure 8.5) is based on our understanding of the 
impacts of the 2015 F-gas regulation on UK F-gas emissions. By 2030, F-gas emissions are due to 
fall by 68% when compared to current 2015 total emissions. Some EU countries have introduced 
further measures to reduce the use of F-gases, including taxes, additional bans or funding for 
research and deployment of low-GWP alternatives.  

The UK is also currently participating in international negotiations, looking for ways of 
controlling HFCs through an amendment of the Montreal Protocol. The UN countries have 
agreed to work together on a pathway for controlling the production and consumption of HFCs. 
Under the proposed amendment, HFCs in developed countries would be reduced through 
incremental targets up to a cut of 86% by 2036. If ratified, the amendment will come in to force 
in 2019. These plans are less stringent than the F-gas regulation up to 2030, but more ambitious 
beyond 2034, when there is currently no further target under the F-gas regulation. An extension 
of the F-gas regulation beyond 2030 will be considered by the EU in 2022.

Policy progress 

The UK's decision to leave the EU means there is uncertainty about the future of the F-gas 
regulation. If the F-gas regulation is converted into UK law as part of the Great Repeal Bill, it 
would require some amendment to achieve the intended outcomes. As a result there is a risk of 
under-delivery of cost-effective abatement of F-gas emissions. 

Last year, we recommended the UK Government should seek opportunities to exceed EU 
regulatory minimums on F-gas abatement, where evidence suggests cost-effective and 
comparable alternatives exist. There has not been any new action from the UK Government over 
the last year on this (Table 8.3). 

Policy recommendations 

To address the risk of not delivering cost effective abatement towards the fourth and fifth 
carbon budgets the Government should aim to continue the UK's inclusion in the F-gas 
regulation, or develop equivalent or stronger legislation in the UK. 

The Government should also investigate opportunities to go beyond the EU regulatory 
minimums on F-gases, including the impacts on overall EU F-gas emissions of the UK going 
further. Where evidence suggests that further cost-effective abatement is available, the 
Government should pursue policies to achieve this abatement.

Key messages and recommendations 

The devolved administrations have an important role to play tackling climate change. Their actions 
form part of meeting their own domestic objectives, as well as the UK's overall commitment. Scotland, 
Wales and Northern Ireland together accounted for 23% of UK emissions in 2015 (respectively 9%, 9%, 
and 4%), while they account for 16% of the UK’s population and 13% of GDP. 

Scotland has its own climate legislation, the Climate Change (Scotland) Act and has set annual targets 
to 2032. The Scottish Government is planning to bring forward new climate change legislation, on 
which the Committee advised in March 2017. The draft Climate Change Plan, setting out proposals and 
policies to meet targets to 2032, was published in January 2017. The Committee will comment on the 
draft Plan in our progress report later this year.  

In Wales, the 2016 Environment (Wales) Act requires the legislation of emission reduction targets and 
the setting of carbon budgets. The Committee advised on the design of these targets and budgets in 
March 2017 and will advise on their levels in the Autumn.  

Northern Ireland has emission reduction targets set by the Northern Ireland Executive. In May 2010, the 
Northern Ireland Executive agreed to a proposal by the Minister of the Environment to establish a 
cross-departmental working group on climate change. The Executive’s Greenhouse Gas Action Plan 
was agreed and published in February 2011, outlining how each department in the Executive will 
contribute towards meeting the 2025 emission reduction target. 

Powers are fully or partially devolved in a number of areas relevant to emissions reductions, with some 
variation by nation. Key areas of devolved powers include aspects of power policy, transport demand-
side measures, energy efficiency, waste, agriculture and land use. In Wales, the 2017 Wales Act raised 
the threshold for large-scale energy consents from 50 MW to 350 MW, granting the Welsh Government 
more devolved powers. It is expected more powers will be devolved in line with recommendations of 
the Smith Commission and Silk Commission. The devolved governments also have important roles 
implementing UK policy (such as renewable energy deployment) through the provision of additional 
incentives and in areas such as planning consents. 

Our key messages are: 

• Progress in reducing emissions is mixed across the devolved administrations. Significant
reductions are largely confined to the Scottish power sector, while transport emissions are on an
upward trend:

‒ In Scotland, emissions fell by around 3% in 2015, largely due to another fall in power 
sector emissions. Power emissions will have fallen again in 2016 due to the closure of 
Longannet coal-fired power station.97 There was considerably less progress in reducing 
emissions in other sectors. Transport emissions have risen for the past two years, while very 
little progress is apparent in agriculture and non-residential buildings. 

‒ In Wales, emissions fell by around 1% due to a fall in industry emissions, while those in 
other sectors were broadly flat. This follows a period in which Welsh emissions have been 
rising gradually. Transport emissions have risen for two years in a row. In contrast to the UK 
as a whole, Welsh power sector emissions rose in 2015. 

‒ In Northern Ireland, emissions are broadly flat overall and in each sector. 

• Urgent action is needed in those areas where devolved nations now have sufficient power to act.
For example, action could be taken to address failures to meet tree-planting targets, on further
incentives to improve energy efficiency and heating of buildings and on non-financial barriers to

Introduction 
In this chapter we review progress in the devolved administrations in 2015, and report on 
changes in emissions in each nation and in the different sectors of the economy. We also assess 
progress in key policy areas since our previous UK and Scottish progress reports in 2016. 

The analysis that underpins our key messages and recommendations is set out in the following 
sections, starting with an overview section, followed by emission trends and progress towards 
targets, and then sections on each sector. 

1. Devolved administrations overview
The devolved administrations have an important role to play in tackling climate change. Their 
actions form part of meeting their own domestic objectives, as well as the UK's overall 
commitment. They have fully or partially devolved powers in a number of areas relevant to 
emissions reduction. These vary by nation, but will become increasingly important as powers are 
devolved further in the coming years. Key areas of devolved responsibilities currently include 
transport demand-side measures, energy efficiency, agriculture, land use and waste. The 
devolved administrations also have important roles in implementing UK policy (such as 
renewable energy deployment) through the provision of additional incentives and their 
approach in areas such as planning policy.98  

The devolved administrations have adopted a range of emission reduction legislation, targets, 
policies and strategies for reducing emissions and monitoring progress:  

• Scotland passed its own Climate Change (Scotland) Act in 2009, which sets a long-term
target to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs)99 by at least 80% in 2050 relative to
1990, with an interim target to reduce emissions by 42% in 2020. Secondary legislation set a
series of annual emission reduction targets to 2032. The Scottish Government published its
draft Third Report on Proposals and Policies (draft Climate Change Plan) in January 2017. The
Committee will comment on this in its Scottish Progress Report, due later this year (Autumn
2017). The Scottish Government has committed to introducing new climate change
legislation, including a tighter 2020 target. In March 2017, the Committee provided advice
on that Bill.100 On 13 June 2017, the Scottish Government proposed that the Bill should
contain a 2050 target for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on 1990 levels.101

• Wales passed the Environment (Wales) Act in 2016, which includes its approach to
addressing climate change as a key component. The Act provides for the setting of emission
reduction targets to 2050, including at least an 80% reduction from 1990 levels in 2050, and
five-year carbon budgets. In April 2017, the Committee provided advice on the design of
Welsh carbon targets,102 and will advise on the level of carbon budgets in October 2017.

• Northern Ireland has emission reduction targets set by the Northern Ireland Executive. The
Committee provided an update to the Executive on the Appropriateness of a Northern
Ireland Climate Change Act in January 2016.103

2. Emission trends and progress towards targets
The latest UK emissions data are for 2016, but the latest data available for the devolved 
administrations are for 2015. We focus in this section on analysis of the change in emissions from 
2014 to 2015 and the longer-term trend between 2009 and 2015.104  

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland accounted for 23% of UK emissions in 2015 (respectively 
9%, 9% and 4%), while they account for 16% of the UK’s population and 13% of GDP.  

Scottish emissions fell 2.9% in 2015, with an average decrease of 3.4% per year between 2009 
and 2015, while Wales’ emissions fell 1.2%, with an average increase of 0.5% per year between 
2009 and 2015, and Northern Ireland emissions increased 0.6% with an average decrease of 0.3% 
per year between 2009 and 2015 (Figure 9.1). Greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 3.8% 
between 2014 and 2015 for the UK, with an average annual decrease of 2.9% between 2009 and 
2015.  

Scotland is on track to meet its own 2020 target, but neither Wales nor Northern Ireland are on 
track to meeting their near-term targets (Table 9.2).

Notes: The latest UK emissions data considered elsewhere in this report are for 2016, but the latest data available 
for the devolved administrations are for 2015. These data (unless stated) do not account for trading in the EU ETS. 
The Scottish targets and emissions to date include Scotland's share of international aviation and shipping (IA&S) 
emissions, as these are included in the measure of Scottish emissions under the legislated targets - the explains 
the difference between the 38% reduction on 1990 emissions presented here and the 37% reduction excluding 
IA&S presented earlier. IA&S emissions are not included for Wales, Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole. The 
2020 targets are expected to change in Wales and Scotland: in Wales, the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 requires 
Wales to legislate a statutory 2020 target by 2018, and the Scottish Government has announced that it will bring 
forward a new Climate Change Bill, including a new 2020 target of reducing actual Scottish emissions by more 
than 50%. In March 2017, the CCC recommended that the level of such a 2020 target should be a 57% reduction 
on 1990 levels. 

In Scotland, total emissions have fallen to 45.7 MtCO2e, in 2015 mainly as a result of further falls 
in power sector emissions. Scotland met its annual target for 2015. Scottish emissions fell 39% 
between 1990 and 2015, the largest reduction in the UK: 

• There were strong falls in 2015 in emissions from the power sector (-21%), and moderate falls
in the land use, land-use change and forestry sector (-7%) and the waste sector (-4%).

• There was a moderate increase in emissions from residential buildings (+3%) and non-
residential buildings (+1.5%) and from the transport sector (+1.4%).

• Emissions on the 'net' measure used under Scotland's existing emissions targets105 rose by
0.8 MtCO2e in 2015, due to a slight rise in actual Scottish emissions outside the EU ETS
(mainly transport and buildings), together with an increase in Scotland's share of allowances

105  ‘Net’ emissions are calculated under the Net Scottish Emissions Account (NSEA), taking into account non-traded 
emissions, surrendered units and Scotland’s assigned EU ETS cap (known as the specified amount). 




180 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap   |   Committee on Climate Change 

in the EU Emissions Trading System.106 For 2015, the Net Scottish Emissions Account (NSEA) 
was 45.5 MtCO2e, below the annual target of just under 46 MtCO2e.  

In Wales, total emissions decreased to 45.7 MtCO2e in 2015. This is a smaller fall in emissions 
than that in 2014. Emissions since 1990 have fallen 20%.  

• In 2015, there was a mixture of small increases and small falls for most sectors with the
overall fall in emissions (0.6 MtCO2e) largely driven by the fall in industry emissions (0.7
MtCO2e):

‒ Emissions increased in a number of sectors: non-residential buildings (+4%), residential
buildings (+2%) and transport (+2%). 

‒ Only the waste sector (-8%) and the industry sector (-4%) had falling emissions, whilst 
emissions in the power sector and in the agriculture sector were flat. 

‒ Between 2009 and 2015 emissions from power and industry rose by an average of 2% per 
annum. 

Wales has a (non-statutory) target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 
1990 levels by 2020. In 2015, emissions were 20% lower than in 1990 (compared to 38% 
for the UK). On the basis of progress to date, the 40% target by 2020 is likely to be missed. 

Wales has a target to reduce annual emissions by an average 3% per annum (against a 
2006-2010 baseline) in areas of devolved responsibility: transport, resource efficiency and 
waste, business, residential, agriculture and related land use, and public sector. For 2014, 
the most recent year for which data are available, this translates into a 12% reduction 
target against the baseline. The 2014 target was met, as there was a 6% reduction 
between 2013 and 2014, with relevant emissions now 20% below the baseline. 

In Northern Ireland, emissions in 2015 increased to 20.7 MtCO2e. Northern Ireland’s target 
requires a lesser emissions reduction than the Scottish and Welsh targets, in part reflecting the 
larger share of its emissions from difficult to reduce sectors (especially agriculture). The changes 
in sectoral emissions were small, with some increases and some falls: 

• Emissions in 2015 fell in the waste (-6.5%) and buildings sectors (both residential (-1.9%) and
non-residential (-3.6%)).

• Emissions in 2015 rose in the transport (+2.1%), land use, land-use change and forestry
(LULUCF) (+1.9%), industry (+1.7%) and agriculture (+1.3%) sectors.

• Northern Ireland has a target to reduce emissions in 2025 by at least 35% compared to 1990
levels. In 2015, emissions in Northern Ireland were 18% below their 1990 levels. Northern
Ireland Executive projections suggest that progress is falling short of what is required in
order to meet the 2025 target.

Overall, emissions in the devolved administrations were collectively 28% below 1990 levels in 
2015. The differences across the nations in part reflect the relative importance of different 
sectors at the devolved level.  

There have been significant revisions to emissions data for all the devolved administrations, due 
to improvements in the methodology for estimating emissions mainly in the land use, land-use 
change and forestry (LULUCF) and waste sectors (Box 9.1).  

106  Scotland's share of EU ETS allowances increased in 2015 relative to 2014, due to an increase in the total number 
of allowances being auctioned at EU level, which reflects the timing of the ‘backloading’ initiative.

Chapter 9: Devolved administrations 181 

Box 9.1 Inventory revision in 2017 

Inventory improvements are designed to increase the transparency, accuracy, consistency, 
comparability, and completeness of the inventory. Changes to the 2017 emissions inventory mainly 
affected the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) and waste sectors. New Scotland-specific 
data on waste management and forests on organic soil have allowed improved estimates. 

• These revisions affect estimates of Scottish emissions to a significantly greater extent than for the
other devolved administrations or the UK as a whole, due to the importance of the LULUCF sector
in Scotland. As we highlighted in our recent report on Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions,107

estimates of Scottish emissions are more uncertain (±10%) than those for Wales (±3%), Northern
Ireland (±7%) or the UK as a whole (±3%). The revision resulted in a downward revision to waste
sector emissions and increased estimates of LULUCF emissions, due to a reduction in the estimated
size of the carbon sink attributed to the forestry sector:

‒ The estimate for Scottish emissions in 1990 is largely unchanged overall, due to offsetting 
changes: LULUCF emissions have been revised up by 3.8 MtCO2e from estimates in 2016, 
while waste emissions have been revised downward by 4.2 MtCO2e (-43%). The overall 
revision to estimated emissions for 1990 is a reduction of 0.2 MtCO2e (-0.2%). 

‒ The latest estimate of the LULUCF sink for 2014 is 3.2 MtCO2e smaller than was estimated 
in 2016. This is offset to a degree by a downward revision of 0.8 MtCO2e in waste emissions 
(-34%). The overall revision to estimated emissions for 2014 is an increase of 2.6 MtCO2e 
(5.9%). 

‒ Because emissions estimates for 1990 and 2014 have been impacted differently by these 
inventory changes, there have been significant changes in estimates of percentage 
reductions on 1990 levels. Last year's report stated that total Scottish emissions had fallen 
by 41% between 1990 and 2014; however, after the inventory change this reduction is now 
estimated at 37%. 

‒ The difference in revisions to 1990 and 2014 emissions is unusual. Previous inventory 
changes have tended to affect estimates for both 1990 and more recent years in similar 
ways (Figure B9.1), often leaving the percentage change against 1990 emissions largely 
unaffected.  

• The inventory changes affect estimates of 1990 Welsh emissions more than those for recent years:

‒ LULUCF emissions in 1990 are now estimated to be 0.7 MtCO2e larger than the estimate 
made in 2016, while industry emissions are now estimated to be 0.2 MtCO2e smaller than 
the 2016 estimate.  

‒ Whilst the 1990 inventory estimate has been revised upwards by 0.3 MtCO2e (+0.5%), the 
emissions estimate for 2014 emissions was revised downwards by 0.1 MtCO2e (-0.3%).  

‒ As a result, rather than emissions in 2014 being 18% smaller than in 1990, as was estimated 
in 2016, following the revisions this reduction is now estimated to be 19%. 

• For Northern Ireland the inventory changes revised emissions upwards in all years.

‒ Estimates for 1990 are more strongly affected than emissions in 2014; the revised emissions 
estimates for 1990 are 2.3% higher whilst the 2014 emissions estimate is 1.1% higher. 

‒ The revision is driven mostly by changes to LULUCF emissions (0.5 MtCO2e increase for 
1990; 0.3 MtCO2e increase for 2014). On 2016 estimates, emissions in 2014 were 17% below 
1990 levels; as a result of the revision the reduction is now estimated to be 18%.

3. Power sector

Emissions, drivers and electricity generation trends 

Progress in the devolved administrations is mixed. Power sector emissions decreased in Scotland 
whilst remaining unchanged in Wales and Northern Ireland in 2015 (Figure 9.2).  

Emissions decreased significantly in Scotland (-21%), whilst they were flat in Wales and Northern 
Ireland:  

• In Scotland:

‒ Emissions decreased to 7.7 MtCO2e in 2015 with an average annual decrease of 8.8%
between 2009 and 2015.108 Power sector emissions accounted for 17% of total Scottish 
emissions, having decreased by 48% between 1990 and 2015.  

‒ Coal and gas generation continued to decrease (-18% and -30% respectively), whilst 
renewable generation increased further (14%).  Renewables in Scotland made up 42% of 
all generation, up from 38% in 2014 (Figure 9.3). 

108 Scotland's last large coal-fired plant, Longannet, closed in 2016. Due to this, power sector emissions will fall 
substantially in 2016 (for which data will be available in 2018).

• In Wales:

‒ Power sector emissions remained at 13 MtCO2e in 2015, accounting for 29% of total
Welsh emissions. They are 17% higher than 1990 levels. 

‒ Overall generation rose 17%, although Wales was again a net importer of electricity from 
England, as in 2014. Coal generation increased by 7% and there was a 44% increase in 
renewable generation. Nuclear generation almost doubled (99%) reflecting that Wylfa 
Nuclear Power Station, which had been out of operation for five months in 2014, 
operated most of 2015, before closing permanently on 30 December 2015. 

• In Northern Ireland:

‒ Emissions were unchanged at 3.8 MtCO2e in 2015, with an annual average increase of
0.7% between 2009 and 2015. Emissions are 28% lower than 1990 levels. The sector 
accounts for 19% of total Northern Irish emissions. 

‒ There was a small decrease in coal generation (2%) and a rise in renewable generation 
(32%). There was also an increase in gas generation (10%), which already makes up the 
largest share (48%) of total generation.  

At the UK level, emissions decreased by 16% in the power sector between 2014 and 2015 with 
an average annual decrease of 6.1% per year between 2009 and 2015.

Progress and policy on renewable electricity 

Renewable electricity generation decreased slightly in 2016, the most recent year for which data 
are available, due to lower load factors on wind, although there has been a general trend across 
the devolved administrations for an increase in renewable capacity (Figure 9.4). In 2016 the 
devolved administrations together accounted for 33% of UK renewable generation. The 
devolved administrations each have targets or milestones for renewables:  

• Scotland accounted for 24% of UK renewable generation in 2016. Generation decreased by
10% from 2015 despite renewable capacity increasing by 11%, due to a UK-wide average
reduction in wind speeds compared to 2015.

‒ Scotland has a target for the equivalent of 100% of gross electricity consumption in 2020
to be met from renewables. In 2015 the share was 59% (up from 50% in 2014) -
renewable sources grew largely due to the significant increase in operational wind sites. 

‒ As of May 2017, an additional 11.8 GW of renewable electricity projects are either in 
planning (3.1 GW), awaiting construction (6.3 GW) or under construction (2.4 GW). This is 
a slight decrease in the project pipeline: in 2015, a total of 13.3 GW additional capacity 
was either in planning (4.1 GW), awaiting construction (7.7 GW) or under construction 
(1.5 GW). 

‒ 10.9 GW of the 11.8 GW are wind projects, 4.2 GW offshore and 6.7 GW onshore. If 100% 
of this additional wind capacity were to be realised, it would increase generation from 
renewables by about 31 TWh per year, equivalent to an additional 92% of current

Scottish gross electricity consumption.109 However, the renewable electricity targets 
remain challenging, as it is unlikely that all the projects consented will progress to the 
commissioning stage. 

• Wales generated 5.2 TWh of renewable electricity in 2016, accounting for 6% of the UK's
renewable generation in 2016. Large infrastructure planning is a reserved matter. Previously
decisions over projects greater than 50 MW have been decided by the UK Planning
Inspectorate,110 but the 2017 Wales Act raised that threshold to 350 MW.

‒ A target111 to produce 7 TWh from renewables by 2020 is likely to be met. As of May 2017,
there are 2.4 GW of projects in the pipeline, either in planning, awaiting construction or 
under construction. Of this 2.4 GW capacity are 40% onshore wind projects, 32% biomass 
projects, 13% solar and 13% tidal barrage and tidal stream projects.  

‒ Wales’ largest onshore wind farm, Pen y Cymoedd (256 MW), is fully operational as of May 
2017, and is expected to generate 700 GWh annually. 

‒ The independent Hendry review of tidal lagoons concluded in January 2017, backing 
Government support for a pathfinder tidal lagoon project at Swansea Bay in Wales, to 
test the potential long-term contribution of this technology to the UK's energy mix. The 
Government has not yet responded to the review.  

• Northern Ireland accounts for 3% of the UK's renewable generation, generating 2 TWh in
2016. It has a target to produce 40% of electricity consumption from renewables by 2020. In
2016 the share was 25.4%, unchanged from 2015.

‒ Wind continues to dominate renewable generation, accounting for 83% of all renewable
generation in 2016, though this share is down from 90% in 2015. 

‒ Northern Ireland Renewables Obligation (NIRO) was closed in 2016 for new small-scale 
onshore wind (up to 5 MW) projects. 

‒ As of May 2017, there are 1.3 GW of projects in the pipeline, either in planning, awaiting 
construction or under construction. Of this 2.3 GW capacity, 70% are onshore wind 
projects and 20% are solar. 

Scotland is leading the devolved administrations in terms of deployment of renewable power 
capacity. However, whilst Northern Ireland is making progress in solar PV and Wales is at the 
forefront of tidal lagoons, more is likely to be needed to ensure targets continue to be met.  

109 Using a load factor for onshore wind of 26% and for offshore wind of 45%. 
110 The Silk Commission on devolution in Wales recommended that powers over large-scale energy consents 
(between 50 MW and 350 MW in size) become devolved to the Welsh Government by 2020. 
111 Technical Advice Notes are advice to developers and decision-makers. TAN 8 in Wales provides guidance on land-
use planning in relation to renewable energy and sets a target for renewable generation.

4. Buildings

Emissions from residential buildings 

Direct residential emissions across the devolved nations increased by 2% in 2015 (Figure 9.5). 
This was in the context of a 4% increase in residential emissions at UK level, and reflects that the 
winter months of 2015 were colder than those in 2014: 

• In Scotland, emissions from residential buildings accounted for 13% of total emissions and
emissions were 25% lower than 1990 levels.

‒ On an unadjusted basis, they increased by 3%, following a 17% decrease in 2014.

‒ Allowing for the lower winter temperatures, residential emissions on a temperature-
adjusted basis fell by 6% in 2015. 

• In Wales, emissions from residential buildings accounted for 8% of total Welsh emissions and
are 26% lower than 1990 levels.

‒ On an unadjusted basis, they increased by 2% in 2015, following a 17% decrease in 2014.

‒ Allowing for the lower winter temperatures, residential emissions on a temperature-
adjusted basis fell by 4% in 2015. 

• Emissions from residential buildings in Northern Ireland accounted for 12% of total
emissions, and emissions were 37% lower than in 1990.

‒ On an unadjusted basis, they decreased by 2% in 2015, continuing the decrease seen in
2014. This is despite lower average winter temperatures in 2015 than in 2014.

Low-carbon heat 

The main GB support scheme for low-carbon heat is the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). This 
provides payments to those who generate and use renewable energy to heat their buildings. 
Both Scotland and Wales have performed well compared to the GB average in terms of 
installations under the RHI. They have a greater proportion of installations than would be 
expected based on GVA (8% and 3% respectively) and housing shares (9% and 5%). As of 
December 2016, 20% of non-residential capacity was installed in Scotland and 9% in Wales and 
20% of residential capacity accredited in Scotland, 7% in Wales. This reflects Scotland and Wales’ 
larger share of off-grid homes – with 87% of all residential accreditation in Scotland from off-gas-
grid properties (compared to 73% in GB overall).  

In Scotland the Home Energy Scotland renewables loan scheme further supports funding under 
the RHI.  

Scotland has implemented further policies to encourage the uptake of renewable heat. Progress 
is being made, from a low base: 

• In 2015, an estimated 1.5 GW of renewable heat capacity was operational in Scotland,
producing an estimated 4.1 TWh of useful renewable heat.112 This represents a 47% increase
in renewable heat capacity and a 37% increase in heat generated from renewable sources
compared with 2014.

112  Renewable heat technologies include biomass, biomass CHP, heat pumps, energy from waste and solar thermal.

• In 2014, Scotland generated 3.8% of its non-electrical heat demand from renewable
resources. It is estimated that in 2015 around 5.5% of non-electrical heat demand came from
renewable sources.

• The publication of the Scotland Heat Map113 was accompanied by a further £7 million
funding for the District Heating Loan Scheme in 2016-17, and the set-up of the Scottish Heat
Networks Partnership Practitioner Group.

For Wales, heat generation from biomass boilers, heat pumps and biogas is increasing, largely 
due to the non-domestic RHI for farm and commercial activities. We recommended in 2016 that 
the Welsh Government develop a heat strategy and set a low-carbon heat target to encourage 
uptake, especially in residential buildings. There has not been any progress to date.  

The Welsh Government has committed to setting new energy targets this year. We recommend 
that this includes consideration of low-carbon heat deployment, alongside low-carbon 
electricity. 

To support the development of low-carbon heat in Northern Ireland, the Executive introduced 
its own RHI and Renewable Heat Premium Payment (RHPP) schemes, which are now both closed. 
The scheme was over-subscribed and there are reports that it was not managed properly. The 
Northern Ireland Executive is currently going through sensitive discussions about power sharing 
and reviews of its handling of the renewable heat incentive scheme. The Committee will have a 
more detailed discussion with Northern Ireland later this year.  

Fuel poverty and progress in energy efficiency policy 

Fuel poverty is a partially devolved issue, with each devolved administration having its own 
targets to eradicate fuel poverty, by 2016 in Scotland and 2018 in Wales and Northern Ireland. 
The devolved administrations place great emphasis on aligning climate change mitigation with 
wider social benefits, such as the reduction of fuel poverty. The devolved administrations 
continue to use the 10% definition,114 rather than the Low Income High Cost (LIHC) measure 
used in England.  

In 2015, 31% of households in Scotland were estimated to be in fuel poverty. For Wales, previous 
model projections have suggested 23% of households were in fuel poverty in 2016. For Northern 
Ireland, latest available data were for 2011 when 42% of households were in fuel poverty.  

Reducing fuel poverty is more of a challenge in the devolved administrations than in England, 
reflecting factors including lower average incomes, a lower proportion of homes being on the 
gas grid, and a greater proportion of energy-inefficient properties. Energy efficiency policy is 
more comprehensive in the devolved administrations than in England:  

• The main energy efficiency scheme, the Energy Company Obligation (ECO), is GB-wide
(Chapter 3), but Scotland and Wales have devolved powers to develop their own schemes.

• Scotland and Wales have been successful in leveraging funding from the ECO. Their share of
funding is higher than their share of the housing stock.

113  http://www.gov.scot/heatmap  
114  Under the '10% definition', a household is said to be in fuel poverty if it needs to spend more than 10% of its 

income on fuel to maintain an adequate level of warmth (typically defined as 21 degrees for the main living area 
and 18 degrees for other occupied rooms). Under the LIHC definition, a household is considered to be fuel poor 
if they have required fuel costs that are above average (the national median level) and were they to spend that 
amount, they would be left with a residual income below the official poverty line. 

http://www.gov.scot/heatmap




Chapter 9: Devolved administrations 189 

• In Northern Ireland, energy efficiency is fully devolved and the Executive has developed
similar supplier schemes to GB, as well as their own additional policies.

Box 9.2 shows the range of policies to reduce fuel poverty that are in place in the devolved 
administrations, focusing on funding for energy efficiency for fuel-poor households. Data on fuel 
poverty in Northern Ireland needs updating to assess progress made on the 2011 fuel poverty 
strategy. 

Box 9.2. Fuel poverty policies in the devolved administrations 

In Scotland: 

• In 2015, the fuel poverty rate was the lowest recorded since 2008 and fuel poverty declined from
35% to 31%, equivalent to a reduction in fuel-poor households of around 97,000 compared to
2014. This was due to a combination of factors: a substantial drop in the price of domestic fuel
(accounting for 2.3 percentage points of the reduction), improved energy efficiency (1.3
percentage point reduction) and higher household incomes (0.6 percentage points).

• In April 2017 the Scottish Government announced a £30m interest-free loan scheme under the
Home Energy Efficiency Programme Scotland supporting energy efficiency measures including
solid wall insulation (internal and external), cavity wall, loft and roof insulation, draught proofing
and boilers.

• In March 2017, the Energy Agency in Scotland published the interim results of an evaluation
project to investigate the success of the Scottish Government-funded insulation schemes in
alleviating fuel poverty.115 Households receiving insulation in 2016 under the Area Based Schemes
were monitored. The results show that fuel poverty decreased following the insulation works.

In Wales: 

• The Well-being of Future Generations Act (legislated in April 2015), with clear mechanisms for
reducing carbon emissions and tackling fuel poverty in Wales, should encourage government
agencies to work together to deliver projects. The Welsh Government has announced a new
strategy116 for energy efficiency and addressing fuel poverty to 2026 as part of the Act.

• In 2011, the Welsh Government Warm Homes - NEST programme started to tackle fuel poverty,
committing to a total investment of £120m to improve the energy efficiency of low-income
households. Since its launch, NEST has improved the energy efficiency of over 23,700 homes of
low-income households across Wales and £25.5m were invested in NEST in 2015-2016.117

In Northern Ireland: 

• The most recent policy statement, ‘Warmer Healthier Homes - a new Fuel Poverty Strategy for
Northern Ireland’, was published in 2011 and has not been updated since.

• The Department for Communities launched the Affordable Warmth Scheme, addressing fuel 
poverty in the private sector. The scheme provides grants for a range of energy efficiency
measures, such as insulation, heating, replacement of windows and solid wall insulations.

• The Boiler Replacement Scheme closed to new applications in March 2016.

Non-residential buildings 

Emissions from non-residential buildings fell in Northern Ireland but rose in Scotland and Wales 
in 2015 (Figure 9.6): 

• In Scotland, emissions from non-residential buildings rose by 1.5%, with emissions from
commercial buildings increasing by 4% and those from the public sector decreasing by 2%.
The non-residential buildings sector accounted for 5% of total Scottish emissions in 2015.

• In Wales, emissions from non-residential buildings increased by 3.7%, although it is a very
small sector, accounting for 2% of total emissions in 2015. Emissions from commercial
buildings increased 5% and those from the public sector increased 2%.

• In Northern Ireland, emissions from non-residential buildings decreased by 3.6%. This was
due to a 10% decline in commercial buildings emissions. The non-residential buildings sector
accounted for 2% of Northern Ireland emissions in 2015.

5. Industry
Direct emissions from industry decreased in Wales in 2015, whilst they increased in Scotland and 
Northern Ireland (Figure 9.7), in the context of an overall 2.2% fall at UK level:  

• In Scotland, emissions from industry increased by 2.4% in 2015, although they decreased by
an annual average of 2.1% between 2009 and 2015. Emissions from the sector accounted for
26% of total Scottish emissions and have decreased 45% since 1990.

• In Wales, emissions from industry decreased 4.4% in 2015 to 15.6 MtCO2e, but increased by
an annual average of 1.6% between 2009 and 2015. Industry emissions in 2015 were 31%
lower than 1990 levels, 34% of total Welsh emissions. Industry makes up a particularly large
share of total emissions in Wales, mainly due to the Port Talbot steelworks. In 2015, EU ETS
verified emissions for Port Talbot steelworks decreased by 9% (0.75 MtCO2e) on 2014 levels,
similar to the overall fall in Welsh industry emissions. This was followed by a further fall of
11% in 2016.118

• Emissions from industry in Northern Ireland accounted for 13% of total emissions in 2015
and increased by 1.7%, with an annual average increase of 1.3% between 2009 and 2015.
They are 29% lower than in 1990.

The devolved administrations have little control over industrial policies for emission reductions 
which are largely reserved and operate at the UK/EU level (Chapter 4). Policies include the EU 
ETS, Climate Change Levy (CCL) and Climate Change Agreements (CCAs), and the Renewable 
Heat Incentive (RHI).119  

The devolved administrations all offer interest-free loans for small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs) for energy efficiency or resource efficiency projects, through Resource Efficient Scotland 
in Scotland and Carbon Trust in Wales and Northern Ireland.

6. Transport

Overview 

Demand-side measures such as road maintenance, cycling, and bus policies are devolved 
matters. Supply-side transport policy remains reserved, although devolved administrations can 
support these (e.g. through provision of electric vehicle charging infrastructure).  

As part of the devolution settlement, air passenger duty (APD) will be devolved to the Scottish 
Government which plans to reduce APD by 50% from April 2018.  

Emissions trends and drivers 

Emissions from transport increased by 2% across the UK in 2015, a trend that is also present 
across the devolved administrations from 2014 to 2015 (Figure 9.8):  

• In Scotland, transport emissions increased by 1.4% in 2015, the second consecutive annual
increase, and were 10.8 MtCO2e, slightly above the level in 1990. Transport emissions
account for 24% of total emissions in Scotland in 2015, the same share as in the UK.

• In Wales, the transport sector accounts for a smaller share (13%) of overall emissions.
Emissions from transport increased in 2015 by 2%, the second consecutive annual increase,
with an annual average decrease of 0.2% between 2009 and 2015. Welsh transport emissions
are only 1% lower than in 1990.

• In Northern Ireland, transport emissions increased by 2.1% in 2015, with an annual average
decrease by 1% between 2009 and 2015, but were 29% higher than in 1990. Emissions from
the sector were 21% of overall Northern Irish emissions in 2015. The increase in emissions
since 1990 largely reflects an increase in car ownership rates in Northern Ireland, which are
now comparable with the UK average.

• The increase in emissions from the transport sector largely reflects an increase in annual
vehicle-kilometres across the devolved administrations, despite increases in new-car
efficiency in 2014 and 2015 (Table 9.3). The efficiency of new cars is driven by EU legislation;
however, there has been some variation in progress towards achieving the EU’s 2020 target
of 95 gCO2/km by 2020. Improvements in new-car efficiency in the devolved administrations
are in line with those seen in England. However, as discussed at UK level in Chapter 5,
evidence has continued to emerge that there is a large and growing gap between test-cycle
and real-world emissions for new cars.

• The increase in vehicle-kilometres in 2015 in Scotland and Wales (1.2% and 1.3%) is slightly
lower than in England at the same time (1.6%).

Progress developing electric vehicle markets 

There has been an increase in electric vehicle (EV) sales at the UK level since 2010, although this 
is from a low base and has been largely driven by sales in England (which represented 94% of 
the total UK market in 2016). Sales of electric vehicles in Scotland accounted for 4% of UK sales in 
2016, with Wales at 2% and Northern Ireland 1%. These shares were lower than the proportion of 
overall vehicle sales (8% Scotland, 3% Wales and 2% Northern Ireland in 2016).  

Whilst sales of EVs in England in 2016 increased by 32%, they only increased slightly in Scotland 
and Northern Ireland (5% and 3%) and even decreased in Wales (-5%): 

• In Scotland, 0.6% of car sales were EVs in 2016, the same as in 2015 (compared to 1.5% in
England). The Electric Vehicle Loan scheme, that provides interest free loans up to £35,000
for the purchase of an electric vehicle, is open until March 2018.

• In Wales, 0.6% of car sales were EVs in 2016, down from 0.7% in 2015.

• In Northern Ireland, 0.8% of car sales were EVs in 2016, up from 0.7% in 2015.

Scotland and Northern Ireland have continued to make progress developing infrastructure and 
markets for electric vehicles following on from Plugged in Places funding from the Department 
for Transport (DfT):  

• At the beginning of June 2017, there were 1,811 public charging points across Scotland
(14.7% of total UK points), 141 more than in April 2016, an increase of 8.5%.120

• As of June 2017, Wales has 390 charging points, a share of 3.2% of UK charging points.

• Northern Ireland has 458 charging points as of June 2017, a share of 3.7% of UK charging
points.

In terms of sales, progress continues to be slow in the devolved administrations. Barriers to EV 
uptake remain, both financial and non-financial. These are similar to those at a UK level and 
include costs, range anxiety, and lack of information. We recommend new, low-cost approaches 
to financing; on-street residential charge points; softer time-limited measures such as access to 
bus lanes and parking spaces; and raising awareness through public procurement.  

Changing travel behaviour 

The main lever to influence emission reductions from transport in the devolved administrations 
relates to infrastructure and service provision, actions to improve transport planning and the 
support of behaviour change. Measuring success and outcomes in changing behaviour is 
inherently difficult, as the overall impact is small in comparison with other drivers of vehicle-kms 
and demand. Vehicle-kms have been rising in each of the devolved administrations, and across 
the UK, since 2013. 

In Scotland: 

• Transport Scotland continues to fund Smarter Choices, Smarter Places with £5m in
2017/2018. Paths for All will continue to administer the programme.

• The third Cycling Action Plan, published in 2017, includes a new set of actions and outlines
how the Scottish Government, local authorities and all key partners will respond to the needs
of stakeholders to achieve active travel commitments.

In Wales: 

• The Safe Routes in Communities Grant provides funding to local authorities to improve how
easy it is for people to travel around their communities, funding project such as footpaths,
cycle paths or cycle facilities. In 2016/17, nearly £5.2m will be distributed across 20 different
local authorities.

In Northern Ireland: 

• The Travel survey Northern Ireland (2013-2015)121 compares results from 2010-2012 to 2013-
2015 and found that there has been no significant modal shift (change from one mode of
travel to another).

• TravelwiseNI is an initiative to encourage the use of sustainable transport options such as
walking, cycling, public transport or car sharing.

7. Agriculture and land use

Agriculture emissions and drivers 

Emissions from agriculture were unchanged for the UK as a whole in 2015, but increased in 
Wales and Northern Ireland and decreased in Scotland (Figure 9.9).  

There is considerable uncertainty over emissions from agriculture. Work at a UK level is expected 
to reduce that uncertainty over the coming years with the introduction of the Smart inventory. 
The level of uncertainty limits the scope for significant new initiatives at this stage. Despite this 
uncertainty around the level of emissions, the trend of emissions over time is generally more 
robust.

Agriculture in the devolved administrations is relatively more important for emissions, and for 
the economy, than for the UK as a whole. This is especially the case for Northern Ireland where 
2015 emissions were 29% of the total compared to 18% in Scotland, 13% in Wales and 10% at a 
UK level. In 2015: 

• In Scotland, agricultural emissions decrease by 0.8%, with no overall change on average
between 2009 and 2015, although they have reduced by 14% since 1990.

• Emissions from agriculture in Wales increased slightly by 0.6%, with an annual average
increase of 1.1% between 2009 and 2015, and were 15% below 1990 levels.

• In Northern Ireland, emissions from agriculture increased by 1.3%, with annual average
increases of 0.9% between 2009 and 2015, and are just 3% lower than they were in 1990.

Agricultural policy is a devolved matter. As in England, the devolved administrations place 
considerable emphasis on a collaborative approach with the farming industry. To date, policy 
approaches are voluntary, although the Scottish Government has announced its intention to 
regulate if significant progress is not made: 

• Scotland has an emissions reduction milestone for agriculture of 1.3 MtCO2e from 2006
levels by 2020. In 2015 emissions had reduced 0.5 MtCO2e since 2006. However, assessment
of progress is difficult due to changes in the methodology used to measure agricultural
emissions since the target was set. The draft Climate Change plan sets out the Scottish
ambition and milestones for this sector. The Committee will consider this further in our
Scottish progress report, later this year.

• Wales has set a reduction target of between 0.6 MtCO2e (10% below 2008 levels) and 1.5
MtCO2e by 2020 in its 2010 Climate Change Strategy. However, assessment of progress is
difficult due to changes in the methodology used to measure agricultural emissions since the
target was set. Proposed emission reductions are being delivered through programmes such
as Glastir.

• In Northern Ireland, in 2016 the Greenhouse Gas Implementation Partnership (GHGIP), a
collaborative strategy between stakeholders and the Executive, published their second
report, "Efficient Farming Cuts Greenhouse Gases - Implementation Plan 2016-2020 ".122

The plan focuses on reducing carbon intensity through the increasingly efficient use of
resources and practices.

Forestry and land use emissions 

Forestry and land use are devolved matters. The size of the carbon sink from the land use, land-
use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector was affected by inventory changes (see section 2), 
therefore the figures in this report are not directly comparable to those from previous years.  

In Scotland in 2015 the sink decreased between 2014 and 2015, whilst in Wales the sink 
increased (Figure 9.10). In Northern Ireland, the LULUCF sector is a net emitter and emissions 
increased by 1.9%:  

• In Scotland, the size of the carbon sink decreased to 2.8 MtCO2e in 2015, from 3.0 MtCO2e in
2014. However, the size of the sink increased between 2009 and 2015 by an annual average

Gases Implementation Plan 2016–2020. 




Chapter 9: Devolved administrations 197 

of 0.03 MtCO2e. In 1990 the sector was a source of emissions equivalent to about 1.5 MtCO2e. 
The carbon sink in Scotland represents 38% of the UK's total LULUCF sink.  

• In Wales, the small sink (-1% of Welsh emissions) increased in 2015, by 0.04 MtCO2e to 0.34
MtCO2e. Between 2009 and 2015 the sink has increased by an annual average of 0.02
MtCO2e.

• In Northern Ireland, the sector was a net emitter in 2015, emitting 0.7 MtCO2e, with an annual
average increase of 0.01 MtCO2e between 2009 and 2015. The sector accounts for 3% of total
emissions.

For the forestry sector, the devolved administrations have ambitious targets to increase the rates 
of forest planting; however current planting rates do not match those ambitions. 

The devolved administrations should consider what further actions are needed to ensure tree 
planting targets are met. These could include introducing additional measures to incentivise 
planting. Any plan or strategy that is introduced should be developed and delivered jointly with 
key stakeholders and possibly with other nations.  

• In Scotland, planting rates decreased in 2016 by 39% to 4,600 hectares (ha), missing the
target of 10,000 ha new woodland each year.

‒ As planting rates have decreased across all nations, Scotland still has the largest share of
new planting in the UK at 84% in 2016.  

‒ The draft Scottish Climate Change plan sets more ambitious targets; the Committee will 
assess these in our Scottish progress report later this year. 

• Following an 89% decrease in 2015, the planting rate in Wales remained at very low levels in
2016 (around 100 ha of new woodland). This is significantly off-track from the Welsh Climate
Change Strategy aspiration to create 100,000 ha of new woodland between 2010 and 2030,
which requires an average of 5,000 ha/year.

• In Northern Ireland, planting rates declined further to 100 ha in 2016, a decline of 50%.

Emissions can also be absorbed into or released by soils. The LULUCF inventory currently only 
includes peatland emissions from lowland peat, mainly related to extraction for horticultural use. 
BEIS is currently in the process of incorporating the IPCC’s Wetland Supplement into the UK’s 
Inventory in time for 2018. This will capture emissions from upland as well as lowland peat, and 
carbon sequestration from restoration practices. 

Peatlands in the devolved administrations account for large areas of land: 

• Peatlands cover approximately 20% of land area in Scotland. They account for 60% of the
UK’s peatlands and 4% of Europe’s total peat carbon store. 600,000 hectares of peatlands
require restoration in Scotland. Scotland’s 2014 National Peatland Plan sets out proposals for
research and awareness-raising.

• In Wales, around 25% of the land area is peat. The Resilient Ecosystems Fund has provided
£165,000 to restore peatlands in Welsh Water’s two reservoirs.

• Peatlands cover 13% of Northern Ireland's land area but account for 42% of its soil carbon
store. Around 80% of Northern Ireland’s peatlands have been degraded. Financial support
has been given to restoration projects, largely through the Rural Development Programme.

The devolved administrations should encourage good practice in heather and grass burning to 
avoid damage to peatlands and ensure that detailed management plans are produced for 
restorations.

8. Waste
Waste is fully devolved to the Scottish and Welsh Governments and Northern Ireland Executive. 
Waste emissions account for only a small proportion of total emissions of Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland (3%, 2% and 3% respectively). In 2015, emissions from waste decreased across 
all the devolved administrations (Figure 9.11), falling 4% in Scotland, 8% in Wales, and 6% in 
Northern Ireland, compared to 7% in the UK as a whole.  

In Scotland: 

• The recycling rate of waste from all sources has increased to 56.7%. The target for 2025 set
out in the Zero Waste Plan is 70%.123

• Household recycling rates have increased in 2015 to 44.2%. The Zero Waste Plan set an
interim target for 2013 of 50%. Despite a gradual increase in recycling rates, Scotland is still
falling short of this target.

• The share of total waste from all sources sent to landfill decreased by 5.1% in 2015 to 37% of
total waste. The Zero Waste Plan target for 2025 is 5%.

123 Scotland revised the methodology of the measurement of the total tonnage of waste that was recycled in 2014. 
Prior to 2014, household waste composted that did not reach the quality standards set by PAS 100/110 was 
included in the recycling figures. Therefore, rates pre-2014 should not be compared with post-2014 rates.

In Wales: 

• Wales is leading in the UK regarding recycling rates. The percentage of waste reused,
recycled or composted increased from 56.2% in 2014/15 to 60.2% in 2015/16.

• In its current waste strategy ‘Towards Zero Waste’ (2010),124 the Welsh Government set a
statutory target of recycling 70% of waste by 2024-25.

• Between 2013/14 and 2015/16 waste sent to landfill has reduced by 37%, reducing the share
of waste sent to landfill to 18% in 2015/16.

In Northern Ireland: 

• Northern Ireland has a recycling rate for municipal waste of 42% in 2015/16, a slight increase
from 41% in 2014/15. The target for 2015 of 45% was missed.

• Household waste recycling rate in 2015/16 was also 42%.

200 Meeting Carbon Budgets: Closing the policy gap   |   Committee on Climate Change 

Conclusions 
Overall progress in reducing emissions is mixed across the devolved administrations, with 
progress outside the Scottish power sector being limited and transport emissions on an upward 
trend: 

• In Scotland, emissions fell by around 3% in 2015. Power sector emissions declined again in
2015 and will fall again sharply in 2016 due to the closure of Longannet. There has been
considerably less progress in reducing emissions in other sectors. There is a downward trend
in buildings emissions, although as 2015 was colder than 2014 this did not immediately
translate into lower emissions. Transport emissions in Scotland have risen in the past two
years, while very little progress is apparent agriculture and non-residential buildings.

• In Wales, emissions fell by around 1% due to a fall in industry emissions, while those in other
sectors were broadly flat. This follows a period in which Welsh emissions have been rising
gradually. Transport emissions have risen for two years in a row. In contrast to the UK as a
whole, Welsh power sector emissions rose in 2015.

• In Northern Ireland, emissions are broadly flat in all sectors. Progress in reducing emissions
is required across the board.

The devolved policy levers place an onus on the devolved administrations to address 
weaknesses in the current policy framework. Where policy areas are reserved, it will be 
important to work with the UK Government to ensure that the overall framework is strong 
enough to drive the necessary emissions reductions. 

Climate change policies in Scotland and Wales could change significantly in the upcoming 
months, as plans are put in place to meet emissions targets.  

The Scottish Government has published a draft Climate Change Plan on how to meet the 
existing targets. It will be finalised in early 2018. It has also committed to another climate change 
bill, and has proposed that this includes a 2050 target for a 90% reduction on 1990 emissions. 
The Committee provided advice on the proposed bill in March 2017 and we will assess the 
policies and proposals in the draft Climate Change Plan as part of our Scottish progress report in 
September. 

The Committee provided advice to the Welsh Government on the design of the emissions 
targets and carbon budgets under the Environment Act (Wales) in March 2017. We will advise on 
the levels of the targets and the first two carbon budgets in November, including an assessment 
of areas in which policies need to go further. Once these have been placed in legislation, Welsh 
Ministers are required to publish a report setting out their proposals and policies for meeting 
them.
