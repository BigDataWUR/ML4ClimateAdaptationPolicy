Background

1.1  The climate is changing and the impacts from it are likely to affect almost everyone in 
some way during our lifetimes. There have always been natural fluctuations in climate 
but observational records show that current rates of  change are far greater than those 
experienced in recent history. Some extreme events may occur increasingly often in the 
future. These extreme weather events are likely to disrupt the economy and without adequate 
preparation, could cost lives and money. Building the country’s resilience to climate change is 
a challenge that cuts across society.

1.2  Changing behaviour to respond to the impacts of  climate change is known as adaptation. 
Adaptation needs to be built into planning and risk management to ensure the continued 
success of  businesses, government policies, social and environmental operations and the 
sustainability of  infrastructure and the built environment. All organisations can benefit from 
considering the risks to their operations and assets from climate change and considering the 
actions necessary to adapt to climate change.

1.3  In January 2012, the government laid before Parliament the Climate Change Risk 
Assessment (CCRA) report, as required by Section 56 of  the Climate Change Act 2008. 
This report compared over 100 risks (prioritised from an initial list of  over 700) based on the 
magnitude of  the impact and confidence in the evidence base.

1.4  In response to the CCRA the government is laying a report on the first National Adaptation 
Programme before Parliament at the same time as this report. The National Adaptation 
Programme report sets out government’s objectives, policies and proposals for addressing the 
key risks identified in the CCRA.

1.5  The government’s vision for a climate ready country, as set out in the National Adaptation 
Programme report, is: “A society which makes timely, far-sighted and well-informed decisions 
to address the threats and opportunities posed by a changing climate.” 

1.6  The National Adaptation Programme captures and builds on ongoing work across government 
which is addressing the impacts of  climate change. Equally government is encouraging action 
by businesses, local councils and civil society. Government has worked collaboratively with 
a wide range of  organisations to co-create the Programme, which is structured around five 
themes: 

 • agriculture and forestry
 • buildings and infrastructure
 • business
 • healthy and resilient communities
 • natural environment

1.7  In addition to setting out requirements for the Climate Change Risk Assessment and the 
National Adaptation Programme, the Climate Change Act 2008 gives the Secretary of  State 
the power to direct reporting authorities (organisations with functions of  a public nature and 
statutory undertakers) to produce reports detailing:

 • the current and future predicted impacts of  climate change on their organisation
 • proposals and policies for adapting to climate change
 •  an assessment of  progress towards implementing the policies and proposals set out in 

previous reports

1.8  This is known as the Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP).

1.9  The Climate Change Act 2008 requires the Secretary of  State to lay before Parliament a 
report on how he intends to exercise the power, no later than when the National Adaptation 
Programme report is laid before Parliament. Section 65 of  the Act places requirements on the 
Secretary of  State to set out in the report:

 i.  the circumstances in which directions are likely to be given (the strategy for using 
the power)

 ii.  the authorities or kinds of  authority to whom the Secretary of  State considers directions 
should be given as a matter of  priority

1.10  The government must consult persons likely to be affected by the Adaptation Reporting 
Power. Defra undertook this consultation between 19 December 2012 and 13 February 2013. 
This strategy has been developed after discussions with stakeholders and consideration of  
the consultation responses. A government report on the consultation is available at  
https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/governments-proposed-approach-to-the-
second-round-of-the-adaptation-reporting-power

1.11  This document constitutes the report to Parliament under Section 65 of the Climate 
Change Act 2008.

a challenge that cuts across society.

1.2  Changing behaviour to respond to the impacts of  climate change is known as adaptation. 
Adaptation needs to be built into planning and risk management to ensure the continued 
success of  businesses, government policies, social and environmental operations and the 
sustainability of  infrastructure and the built environment. All organisations can benefit from

the power to direct reporting authorities (organisations with functions of  a public nature and

 • proposals and policies for adapting to climate change
 •  an assessment of  progress towards implementing the policies and proposals set out in 

previous reports

1.8  This is known as the Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP).

1.9  The Climate Change Act 2008 requires the Secretary of  State to lay before Parliament a 
report on how he intends to exercise the power, no later than when the National Adaptation 
Programme report is laid before Parliament. Section 65 of  the Act places requirements on the 
Secretary of  State to set out in the report:

1.10  The government must consult persons likely to be affected by the Adaptation Reporting 
Power. Defra undertook this consultation between 19 December 2012 and 13 February 2013.

2.1  The Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP) aims to:

 •  ensure climate change risk management is systematically undertaken by 
reporting authorities

 • help ensure public service and infrastructure are resilient to climate change
 • monitor the level of  preparedness of  key sectors to climate change

2.2  The ARP helps ensure that ‘persons or bodies with a function of  a public nature’ and 
‘statutory undertakers’ (reporting authorities) are taking appropriate action to adapt to the 
future impacts of  climate change. It helps do this both directly, through engaging organisations 
in reporting, and indirectly, through raising awareness, building capacity in organisations, and 
making examples of  good practice publicly available.

2.3  Reporting has many benefits. It enables organisations to identify and examine their risks: 
risks to their assets, buildings, staff, services and operations, their supply lines, stakeholders 
and regulatory functions. Reporting on adaptation risk management can help promote 
organisational reputation through providing evidence of  how organisations are preparing for 
climate change and extreme weather impacts. It helps them make more cost effective and 
timely decisions about how and when to adapt, contributing to the organisation’s sustainability 
and potential for growth.

2.4  There is considerable public benefit in ensuring that key organisations prepare effectively for 
climate change and report publicly on their work. This allows government and stakeholders to 
identify barriers to adaptation and to assess the degree to which the country’s public services 
are preparing for climate change. The public nature of  the reports helps organisations to 
continue engagement with their stakeholders on the issues. 

2.5  The adaptation reports should contain:

 •  a summary of  the statutory and other functions of  the organisation
 •  an assessment of  the current and future risks to that organisation, and its functions, 

presented by climate change

 •  a programme of  measures to address the risks, including policies and practices that are 
already being implemented

2.6  The adaptation reports should have regard to the analysis in the first Climate Change Risk 
Assessment and the objectives, policies and proposals developed through the National 
Adaptation Programme. 

2.7  The government will use the information from the reports to feed into the National Adaptation 
Programme and into the next national assessment of  risks from climate change. An 
assessment of  the reports will allow a greater understanding of  the risks, any gaps in 
information, and identify priority areas for work in the future. As part of  this information cycle, 
the risk assessment will also feed into decisions on the identification of  future reporting 
authorities. The next national risk assessment of  risks from climate change is due to be 
published no later than 2017.

What was done in the first round of reporting?

2.8  In 2009, the then Secretary of  State laid before Parliament a report on the strategy for 
exercising this power for the first time. The strategy focused on major infrastructure providers 
from the energy, transport and water sectors. The first round was completed in March 
2012, and the reports have been published.1 A government report on this first round of  the 
Adaptation Reporting Power summarises the broader sector-wide results and can also be 
found on Defra’s webpages.

2.9  Discussions with reporting authorities and responses to the consultation show that the 
ARP made a significant contribution to raising understanding of  adaptation and increasing 
action, particularly in sectors where there had been limited consideration previously. It raised 
adaptation to the board level and in many cases embedded climate change risks within 
organisations’ corporate risk management procedures.

2.10  The ARP also demonstrated that organisations are already adapting to climate change and 
mitigating their specific climate change risks. Some sectors are particularly advanced in 
considering climate change and are already running adaptation research programmes and 
taking adaptation actions.

The second round of reporting

2.11  In the second round the government is using a voluntary approach to reporting. The Secretary 
of  State will invite key organisations to report an assessment of  their current and predicted 
climate change threats and opportunities as well as a programme of  adaptation measures. 
The Secretary of  State is not intending to exercise the power to give directions to reporting 
authorities.

2.12  Government will continue to work alongside reporting authorities to help them understand and 
manage their climate change risks. It will work to increase the awareness of  adaptation to 
encourage organisations to report. Government has already engaged with potential reporting 
authorities and the overwhelming response has been in favour of  a voluntary, collaborative 
approach.

2.13  A voluntary approach ensures that the reporting process is flexible and responsive to the 
needs of  reporting authorities and reduces the likelihood of  a ‘tick-box’ approach to reporting. 
The aim is that the most appropriate organisations will identify and own the actions that need 
to be taken in response to the threats and opportunities identified and that the level of  work 
will be proportionate to the organisation.

2.14  Government will be providing advice on developing resilience, as well as ensuring that 
information on climate preparedness and resilience feeds into the Climate Change Risk 
Assessment process.

How will government use the reports?

2.15  Government is planning to use the reports in two ways. First to validate the excellent work 
that was done by reporting authorities during the first adaptation reporting round and ensure 
that progress is being made. Secondly they will give government a greater understanding 
of  adaptation action being taken across sectors. This will feed into the National Adaptation 
Programme and into the development of  the next national climate change risk assessment. 
The reports will also help government design supportive policies for adaptation and ensure 
that the existing regulatory environment encourages adaptation appropriately.

2.16  Policy judgements on the basis of  the reports remain the responsibility of  individual 
government departments. They will take responsibility for analysing the reports and 
considering any actions that might arise from the reports in the sectors for which they have 
policy responsibility.

2.17  Following completion of  the second round the government will undertake a review of  the 
impacts and benefits of  the Adaptation Reporting Power. The review will attempt to assess 
the effectiveness of  the ARP in influencing organisations to identify and respond to risks from 
climate change. It will consider the difference between the mandatory approach used in the 
first round and the voluntary approach used in the second round. The review may need to 
commission further research into the relationship between adaptation reporting and increased 
resilience in specific sectors or organisations. Further discussion of  evidence requirements is 
set out in an Impact Assessment for this report.2

Future use of the Adaptation Reporting Power

2.18  Future strategies for exercising the power are linked to the development of  the National 
Adaptation Programme and will therefore be reviewed and updated on a five yearly cycle.

Next steps

2.19  Government intends to issue invitations to report in winter 2013-2014. Reports should be 
produced by organisations between 2013 and 2016 in accordance with timescales to be 
agreed with the reporting authority. In their response to the consultation exercise a number of  
organisations have already identified the best time for them to produce an adaptation report. 
The process will be as outlined in Box 1.

climate change. It will consider the difference between the mandatory approach used in the 
first round and the voluntary approach used in the second round. The review may need to 
commission further research into the relationship between adaptation reporting and increased 
resilience in specific sectors or organisations. Further discussion of  evidence requirements is 
set out in an Impact Assessment for this report.2

Future use of the Adaptation Reporting Power

2.18  Future strategies for exercising the power are linked to the development of  the National 
Adaptation Programme and will therefore be reviewed and updated on a five yearly cycle.

Next steps

2.19  Government intends to issue invitations to report in winter 2013-2014. Reports should be 
produced by organisations between 2013 and 2016 in accordance with timescales to be 
agreed with the reporting authority. In their response to the consultation exercise a number of  
organisations have already identified the best time for them to produce an adaptation report. 
The process will be as outlined in Box 1.

Criteria for identifying reporting authorities

3.1  The government is committed to using the reporting power in a risk based, targeted and 
efficient way. Not all potentially eligible bodies (of  which there are many thousands) will be 
invited to report in this round of  reporting. 

3.2  The government has defined criteria to designate reporting authorities which the Secretary 
of  State will invite to produce reports. The criteria focus on the key organisations that need to 
adapt to climate change, whilst avoiding duplication of  existing arrangements. These criteria 
are modified from those used to define the first round of  reporting authorities. The criteria for 
the first round of  reporting focused on national infrastructure and did not have the benefit of  
the evidence set out in the Climate Change Risk Assessment to prioritise climate risks. 

3.3  The approach uses the following methodology:

 •  identifying those authorities which are eligible as reporting authorities
 •  identifying those authorities that are vulnerable to the projected impacts of  climate change 

as set out in the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment published in January 2012

 •  no duplication – identifying authorities which are not already subject to other adaptation 
reporting requirements, or are not already covered by an existing voluntary agreement

 •  targeting reporting authorities proportionately

Eligible reporting authorities

3.4  In order to be eligible, organisations need to fulfil one of  the following sub-criteria.3 

3.5  Statutory Undertakers as listed in the Town and Country Planning Act. They are persons 
with statutory authorisation to carry on any of  the following: railway, light railway, tramway, 
road transport, water transport, canal, inland navigation, dock, harbour, pier or lighthouse 
undertaking or any undertaking for the supply of  hydraulic power or a relevant airport 
operator. In addition gas transporters, anyone holding an electricity generation, transmission 
or distribution licence or an air traffic services licence, water or sewerage undertakers, the 
Environment Agency, universal postal service providers and the Civil Aviation Authority.

3.6  Organisations with functions of a public nature. The government has applied the following 
six characteristics as guidance:

 • the extent to which in carrying out the function in question the body is publicly funded
 •  the extent to which the organisation’s activities are underpinned by statute. For example, 

are an organisation’s functions recognised by or provided for in legislation? If  not, does the 
organisation nevertheless operate under the authority of  the government or of  another part 
of  the public sector?

 •  whether the organisation exercises extensive or monopolistic powers, for example, by 
regulating entry to a trade or profession

 •  whether the organisation’s source of  power is derived from more than voluntary submission 
to its jurisdiction. For example, where a party has no choice but to submit to its jurisdiction 
if  they wish to take part in a particular activity

 •  whether the organisation seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the public, and is 
accepted by the public as having the authority to do so

 •  In the case of  a regulatory organisation, whether but for the existence of  that organisation, 
the government would inevitably have intervened to regulate the activity in question

Vulnerability to climate change

3.7  Evidence from the Climate Change Risk Assessment has informed understanding of  how 
sectors are vulnerable to climate change impacts. The CCRA sets out the main priorities for 
adaptation in the UK under five key themes – agriculture and forestry; business, industries 
and services; health and wellbeing; natural environment; and buildings and infrastructure.  
The assessment will be updated by 2017, and every five years subsequently, as 
understanding of  the evidence base improves.

3.8  Key findings from the CCRA include that the UK is already experiencing increased 
vulnerability to extreme weather events. Flood risk in particular would be likely to increase 
significantly across the UK in the absence of  adaptation actions.

3.9  The 2012 CCRA did not look at risk levels for specific organisations as this would have been 
far too detailed to be manageable in a single project. The full findings have been published.4 

3.10  Further research is being undertaken to build on the CCRA. Details can be found in the Defra 
Evidence Plans, published on the Defra website in March 2013. These can be found here 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-plans

3.11  The CCRA has already been used to inform more detailed analyses, including an economic 
assessment of  the costs and benefits of  adaptation options. In addition the Committee on 
Climate Change has provided independent advice on what the total available evidence tells 
us, which is available on its website http://www.theccc.org.uk/publications/

Preventing duplication of existing adaptation reporting 
arrangements

3.12  It would be duplicative to invite an organisation to report if  the organisation was subject to 
existing regulation (or regulation coming into force) or a voluntary agreement:

 •  that requires a comprehensive assessment of  the risks to the functions of  the organisation 
from climate change

 •  that requires a programme of  measures to be drawn up and progress reported on in 
implementing the findings of  this programme of  measures

 •  where the findings are made publically available

Targeting reporting authorities proportionately

3.13  A very large number of  organisations are theoretically eligible under the adaptation reporting 
power. Some of  the sectors highlighted as vulnerable to climate change may be formed of  
many much smaller organisations. The government believes that including such organisations 
as reporting authorities would be disproportionate. 

3.14  The development of  the National Adaptation Programme has involved collaboration with a 
wide range of  stakeholders to develop ways of  helping organisations to consider adaptation 
through methods like sector relevant guidance and provision of  information and tools. 

3.15  Government will focus at a strategic level to minimise what it is asking of  smaller 
organisations. Where appropriate, government will invite umbrella organisations to report on 
behalf  of  members. Determining proportionality must occur on case by case basis.

3.16  The government has not defined a specific threshold for proportionality. The voluntary 
approach means that there is scope for discussion with government to ensure that the 
reporting process is proportionate and beneficial. 

Geographical coverage

3.17  Adaptation to climate change is a devolved policy issue. The reporting power provisions in 
the Climate Change Act 2008 apply to reporting authorities with functions in England and in 
the devolved administrations where their functions relate to non devolved matters in Wales, 
reserved matters in Scotland and reserved and excepted matters in Northern Ireland.

3.18  The Act also gives the Welsh Ministers the power to direct reporting authorities to report 
on devolved matters. In addition there are reserved matters affecting Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland on which the Secretary of  State may request reports. In such instances 
invitations will only be issued by the Secretary of  State where consultation and consent have 
been granted by the relevant Ministers.

3.19  More detailed information on devolution is available in Section 8 of  this document.

Joint reporting

3.20  The legislation makes provision for reporting authorities to prepare a joint report. The first 
round of  adaptation reporting helped to identify the interdependencies between reporting 
organisations in terms of  preparing for the impacts of  climate change. Respondents to the 
consultation on the approach to the second ARP round considered that joint reporting may 
often result in additional burdens on reporting authorities. The government is not proposing 
to invite organisations to report jointly in this round although this option is open to reporting 
authorities. The National Adaptation Programme provides many additional opportunities for 
collaborative working on managing future climate risk.

3.21  In future the government may request joint reports from two or more authorities. One instance 
may be where there are challenges facing a particular geographic location and where 
collaborative risk assessment and actions could be most effective and efficient.

Applying the criteria

3.22  The diagram below identifies organisations and highlights where they fall under the 
three criteria:

 •  eligible as a reporting authority
 •  authorities that are potentially vulnerable to the projected impacts of  climate change
 •  authorities that have a limited or no current regulatory framework on adaptation and no 

suitable sector-led voluntary approach

 •  the way these three criteria overlap

3.23  Those organisations which meet all of  the criteria are the priorities for reporting in the second 
round. Explanation of  how government is engaging with the others through the National 
Adaptation Programme is set out in Section 4.

Organisations that reported in the first round

4.1  The government is keen to ensure that the excellent work organisations did in preparing their 
adaptation reports continues. It is therefore proposing a ‘light-touch’ exercise to find out about 
progress on actions that reporting authorities committed to.

4.2  The government will invite organisations that reported under the first round of  the Adaptation 
Reporting Power to produce updates on their reports, setting out progress on actions and 
assessment of  risk. The risks that these organisations face from climate change are unlikely 
to have changed in the 1-3 year period since they submitted their previous report. The 
government is therefore not proposing that these organisations complete an entire additional 
adaptation reporting process. These organisations are listed in annex A.

4.3  First round reporting authorities have expressed support for this approach and asked that 
the process be made flexible to meet the needs of  individual organisations. Government will 
continue to work with organisations and regulators to ensure that there is minimal duplication 
of  reporting requests. For instance, discussions with water companies indicate that a 
considerable amount of  adaptation information will be contained within their business plans 
for the Periodic Review 2014. Regulators will also discuss the possibility of  collaborating on 
joint reporting.

Transport sector

4.4  The transport sector was identified as a crucial sector in the first round of  reporting. It 
includes organisations responsible for roads, railways, airports and ports. This included the 
regulators, Office of  Rail Regulation and Civil Aviation Authority, two lighthouse authorities 
and two public bodies, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Highways Agency. The 
majority of  these organisations are planning to provide progress reports as part of  the second 
round of  reporting, at different stages over the period of  the National Adaptation Programme. 
The reporting timeframes are guided by regulatory frameworks, development of  the evidence 
base and other reporting cycles.

Energy sector

4.5  The energy sector was a crucial sector in the first round of  reporting. It includes organisations 
responsible for electricity generation, transmission and distribution, as well as gas 
transportation and includes the sector regulator Ofgem.

4.6  National Grid has indicated its desire to submit a progress report towards the end of  2016 to 
align with regulatory timescales. This will enable it to use the outputs of  key research projects 
to assess and update its business climate change risks and actions.

4.7  On behalf  of  the UK gas and electricity distribution network operators, the Energy Networks 
Association has indicated that aligning adaptation reporting with reporting to Ofgem on 
planning for the regulatory review period from 2015 would minimise the burden. The best time 
for it to report progress would be during 2015.

4.8  The electricity generation companies that reported in the previous round intend to report 
collectively on their sectoral resilience to climate change. Energy UK has agreed to be the 
coordinator for this sectoral adaptation update report on electricity generation and has 
indicated this will be produced during 2015.

Water sector

4.9  The water sector was a crucial sector in the first round of  adaptation reporting, including the 
regulator Ofwat. Water companies already produce information suitable for the adaptation 
reporting process through Water Resource Management Planning and the Ofwat Price 
Review process. Government will work with water companies and the regulator to reduce 
any unnecessary duplication and ensure that water companies are able to provide progress 
reports which fit with their regulatory timescales. This is likely to mean that they report 
during 2015.

Public bodies and natural environment sector

4.10  A wide range of  public bodies produced reports in the first round, particularly those with 
responsibility for the natural environment. These organisations include National Parks, 
Forestry Commission, Natural England and the Environment Agency. The process of  
developing the reports acted as a driver to prioritise adapting to climate change within 
their organisations. Although the reports were produced by individual organisations they 
highlighted the need for a partnership approach in the sector. National Park Authorities have 
indicated that updates on their adaptation plans will be available by the summer of  2014. 
Natural England and Forestry Commission (England) plan to submit draft progress reports by 
the end of  2015. The Environment Agency is planning to submit a progress report in 2014.

New organisations to be invited to report in the second round

4.11  The government has modified the criteria which were used in the first round of  reporting and 
so a number of  new priority reporting authorities have been identified. In some areas, the 
Climate Change Risk Assessment has highlighted new risks or new vulnerabilities to risk 
which were not known at the time of  the first round. In some sectors, organisational structures 
have shifted and organisations have new roles and responsibilities. 

Marine Management Organisation

4.12  At the time of  the first round of  the Adaptation Reporting Power the Marine Management 
Organisation (MMO) had not been vested with its powers. As the organisation responsible 
for the sustainable development of  the UK’s marine area it will be very important that climate 
change is adequately prioritised within its decision-making processes. MMO has indicated it 
will produce a climate change adaptation report later in 2013.

Seafish

4.13  The government did not direct the Seafish Industry Authority to report in the first round. 
However it has an important role in supporting the environmental sustainability, efficiency 
and cost-effectiveness of  the seafood industry. Its remit includes the fishing and aquaculture 
sectors, processors, importers, exporters, distributors and consumers of  seafood. It has 
indicated it plans to report at a time in line with its corporate reporting cycle.

The health and social care sector

4.14  The Health Sector Report of  the Climate Change Risk Assessment and the recent Health 
Protection Agency report ‘Health Effects of  Climate Change in the UK 2012’ identify a number 
of  risks to health and social care from climate change which need to be addressed.5

4.15  The first round of  the ARP achieved an initial, partial coverage of  the health sector, with 
Monitor as the nominated reporting body. The Sustainable Development Unit for the health, 
public health and social care sector (SDU) works to promote climate adaptation and climate 
resilience. All NHS provider organisations are encouraged to develop and implement 
Sustainable Development Management Plans (SDMPs) agreed at Board level, covering 
sustainable development, mitigation and adaptation plans. Recent analysis shows that 83% 
of  Strategic Health Authorities, NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts have SDMPs in place 
(May 2012).

4.16  NHS Ambulance Trusts play a key role in the emergency response to severe weather events 
and other associated climate impacts. There are 11 Ambulance Trusts across England (plus 
Isle of  Wight) and as NHS Trusts and NHS Foundation Trusts they are also encouraged to 
develop and implement SDMPs. Government’s National Adaptation Programme will work with 
the Association of  Ambulance Chief  Executives and the SDU to promote climate resilience 
and adaptation within the Ambulance Trusts.

4.17  The health sector is currently undergoing substantial reform, with much of  the responsibility 
for public health coming under local councils, as for social care. As part of  the current reforms 
to the health sector, the emerging Public Health Outcomes Framework also includes an 
SDMP indicator. 

4.18  The government is seeking to promote the use of SDMPs as an existing, successful, voluntary 
reporting approach to address the needs of the ARP. The Sustainable Development Unit for 
the health, public health and social care sector will be the reporting body. It has indicated that 
submitting an adaptation report in summer 2015 would fit with current reporting cycles.

4.8  The electricity generation companies that reported in the previous round intend to report 
collectively on their sectoral resilience to climate change. Energy UK has agreed to be the 
coordinator for this sectoral adaptation update report on electricity generation and has 
indicated this will be produced during 2015.

Water sector

4.9  The water sector was a crucial sector in the first round of  adaptation reporting, including the 
regulator Ofwat. Water companies already produce information suitable for the adaptation 
reporting process through Water Resource Management Planning and the Ofwat Price 
Review process. Government will work with water companies and the regulator to reduce 
any unnecessary duplication and ensure that water companies are able to provide progress 
reports which fit with their regulatory timescales. This is likely to mean that they report 
during 2015.

Public bodies and natural environment sector

4.10  A wide range of  public bodies produced reports in the first round, particularly those with 
responsibility for the natural environment. These organisations include National Parks, 
Forestry Commission, Natural England and the Environment Agency. The process of  
developing the reports acted as a driver to prioritise adapting to climate change within 
their organisations. Although the reports were produced by individual organisations they 
highlighted the need for a partnership approach in the sector. National Park Authorities have 
indicated that updates on their adaptation plans will be available by the summer of  2014. 
Natural England and Forestry Commission (England) plan to submit draft progress reports by 
the end of  2015. The Environment Agency is planning to submit a progress report in 2014.

New organisations to be invited to report in the second round

4.11  The government has modified the criteria which were used in the first round of  reporting and 
so a number of  new priority reporting authorities have been identified. In some areas, the 
Climate Change Risk Assessment has highlighted new risks or new vulnerabilities to risk 
which were not known at the time of  the first round. In some sectors, organisational structures 
have shifted and organisations have new roles and responsibilities. 

Marine Management Organisation

4.12  At the time of  the first round of  the Adaptation Reporting Power the Marine Management 
Organisation (MMO) had not been vested with its powers. As the organisation responsible 
for the sustainable development of  the UK’s marine area it will be very important that climate 
change is adequately prioritised within its decision-making processes. MMO has indicated it 
will produce a climate change adaptation report later in 2013.

Seafish

4.13  The government did not direct the Seafish Industry Authority to report in the first round. 
However it has an important role in supporting the environmental sustainability, efficiency 
and cost-effectiveness of  the seafood industry. Its remit includes the fishing and aquaculture 
sectors, processors, importers, exporters, distributors and consumers of  seafood. It has 
indicated it plans to report at a time in line with its corporate reporting cycle.

The health and social care sector

4.14  The Health Sector Report of  the Climate Change Risk Assessment and the recent Health 
Protection Agency report ‘Health Effects of  Climate Change in the UK 2012’ identify a number 
of  risks to health and social care from climate change which need to be addressed.5

4.15  The first round of  the ARP achieved an initial, partial coverage of  the health sector, with 
Monitor as the nominated reporting body. The Sustainable Development Unit for the health, 
public health and social care sector (SDU) works to promote climate adaptation and climate 
resilience. All NHS provider organisations are encouraged to develop and implement 
Sustainable Development Management Plans (SDMPs) agreed at Board level, covering 
sustainable development, mitigation and adaptation plans. Recent analysis shows that 83% 
of  Strategic Health Authorities, NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts have SDMPs in place 
(May 2012).

4.16  NHS Ambulance Trusts play a key role in the emergency response to severe weather events 
and other associated climate impacts. There are 11 Ambulance Trusts across England (plus 
Isle of  Wight) and as NHS Trusts and NHS Foundation Trusts they are also encouraged to 
develop and implement SDMPs. Government’s National Adaptation Programme will work with 
the Association of  Ambulance Chief  Executives and the SDU to promote climate resilience 
and adaptation within the Ambulance Trusts.

4.17  The health sector is currently undergoing substantial reform, with much of  the responsibility 
for public health coming under local councils, as for social care. As part of  the current reforms 
to the health sector, the emerging Public Health Outcomes Framework also includes an 
SDMP indicator. 

4.18  The government is seeking to promote the use of SDMPs as an existing, successful, voluntary 
reporting approach to address the needs of the ARP. The Sustainable Development Unit for 
the health, public health and social care sector will be the reporting body. It has indicated that 
submitting an adaptation report in summer 2015 would fit with current reporting cycles.

4.19  During this transition period, use of  the ARP within the health and social care sectors will 
need to evolve. With new structures having come into effect in April 2013, government will 
continue to explore with NHS England, the SDU and Public Health England, where the 
adaptation reporting process can add value, for example with Clinical Commissioning Groups 
and the Primary Care Sector. Government’s Climate Ready programme will continue to work 
with the SDU, NHS England and Public Health England to support its promotion of  climate 
adaptation within the SDMP framework.

Chief Fire Officers Association

4.20  The Chief  Fire Officers Association is the professional body representing senior fire and 
rescue officers across the UK. It has volunteered to produce a report setting out the potential 
risks from future weather conditions to its members operations as well as highlighting 
possible future options as to how Fire and Rescue Services may work together and with other 
organisations to respond to those changing risks. It proposes to report by April 2014.

Historic environment and heritage sector

4.21  In developing the approach to the National Adaptation Programme and the second round of  
the ARP, the government has engaged with a number of  organisations in this sector which 
could benefit from reporting alongside other organisations within the sector. Evidence on the 
sector’s capacity to adapt indicates that coordinated action will be helpful.

4.22  English Heritage and the Church of  England have both indicated in response to consultation 
that they intend to produce reports on the climate risks to their organisations and on planned 
actions to address the risks. While they anticipate their reports will focus on the specific 
character and responsibilities of  the individual organisations, they are also establishing a 
wider Historic Environment Climate Change Adaptation Group to define areas of  consensus 
and to ensure that the historic environment is considered appropriately during future land 
management planning.

Other key organisations and sectors 

Prudential Regulation Authority

4.23  The first round of  the Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP) did not prioritise finance as a sector 
at risk from climate change. Since then we have improved evidence on the impacts of  climate 
change, and research to show that organisations such as insurers, investors and mortgage 
providers may be affected. For example, climate change can affect asset performance 
through reduced future investment yields and the productive lifetime of  capital investments 
such as infrastructure. Potentially significant impacts for insurers can also arise from the 
change of  land-use and the increase of  extreme events’ frequency and severity that could 
test the insurability limits for some natural perils. Companies with comprehensive adaptation 
programmes may gain competitive advantages as future markets evolve. While insurance 
companies and institutional investors are not subject to the reporting power, they are working 
with government to help implement the National Adaptation Programme.

4.24  The ARP is relevant to regulators of  the financial sector, to ensure that they are removing 
barriers to adaptation and taking account of  climate change risks in their regulatory 
processes. Government is in discussion with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the 
newly established arm of  the Bank of  England dealing with prudential regulation of  financial 
institutions, about the value of  its producing an adaptation report looking across its functions. 

Internal Drainage Boards

4.25  Defra is currently developing a research project to consider climate change adaptation best 
practice within Internal Drainage Boards (IDBs). Working with IDBs, the project aims to:

 •  support IDBs in sharing best practice on increasing local resilience to climate change
 •  learn from IDB best practice as the sector looks to develop more local and integrated 

approaches to water management

 •  identify and assess the potential of  a range of  enhanced roles for IDBs to help better 
manage extremes of  water and work to design future collaborations or groupings best 
placed to tackle water management at catchment level

4.26  The Association of  Drainage Authorities (ADA) is recognised as the national representative of  
the Internal Drainage Boards (IDBs) and other water level management organisations. It has 
contributed to the development of  the National Adaptation Programme. Government will keep 
under review the value of  inviting ADA to develop an adaptation report on behalf  of  IDBs in 
light of  the research project and implementation of  the National Adaptation Programme.

Food and Environment Research Agency

4.27  The Climate Change Risk Assessment identified that plant pests and diseases, including alien 
ones yet to arrive in the UK, could pose a significant risk under a changing climate. Hence it will be 
very important for the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), as the lead organisation 
within the UK Plant Health Service, to continue to ensure that climate change is prioritised in 
decision making and future planning. The government is currently reviewing the status and 
functions of Fera. Once these wider issues are resolved then government will revisit the question 
of whether it would be valuable to ask Fera to prepare a voluntary adaptation report.

Telecoms sector

4.28  The sector regulator, the Office of  Communications (Ofcom) reported in the first round on 
the risks from climate change to its functions and how it is taking account of  climate change 
impacts on the organisations it regulates. The Secretary of  State will invite Ofcom to provide 
a progress update in the second round. Along with organisations such as Ofwat, Ofgem 
and the Office of  Rail Regulation (ORR), Ofcom participates in a Joint Regulators Group on 
adaptation. Companies in the telecoms sector are not statutory undertakers. The government 
and the regulator are continuing to work with the sector to understand more about potential 
risks arising from future climate change and how to build sectoral resilience to impacts from 
climate change. The industry-led Electronic Communications – Resilience and Response 
Group (EC-RRG) is looking to develop an overview of  the adaptation measures being 
undertaken by the industry.6

Local councils 

5.1  Local councils are independently elected and autonomous bodies. They are largely 
independent of  central government and are directly accountable to their electorates, with 
powers conferred on them by Acts of  Parliament. Government’s commitment to localism 
means delegating power to the lowest appropriate level. Local councils have a crucial part 
to play in this, both in carrying out responsibilities from central government and in devolving 
power further where possible.

5.2  As providers of  key services and as community leaders, local councils play a pivotal role 
in leading, supporting and driving delivery of  actions to increase resilience of  local places, 
communities and businesses. For example, in relation to managing flood risk where, as Lead 
Local Flood Authorities, many councils are responsible for preparing flood risk management 
strategies. Under the Civil Contingencies Act councils are considered first responders to 
a wide range of  civil emergencies, including those related to climate change. Many local 
councils have already produced and implemented adaptation strategies looking at wider 
climate risks.

5.3  The Local Government Association (LGA) has set up the Climate Local initiative, through 
which councils are able to sign up to specific voluntary local actions on both climate change 
mitigation and adaptation. A part of  the agreement is to review commitments regularly and 
to report annually on progress against these commitments. So far around sixty three councils 
have signalled their intention to sign up to Climate Local, with more expected over the coming 
months.7  

5.4  Government acknowledges the importance of, and is supportive of, locally led action on 
climate change to strengthen resilience to current and future climate risk. Government 
will continue to work with the LGA to develop a framework for action through the National 
Adaptation Programme that sets out a clear narrative on ways in which councils can build 
climate resilience. Government will also work through the Core Cities Group, London 
Councils and the Local Adaptation Advisory Panel to share good practice and support locally 
driven adaptation action. Given the government’s localism agenda and in particular the 
establishment of  the LGA’s Climate Local initiative, local councils will not be invited to report 
under the ARP to avoid duplication with sector-led voluntary reporting arrangements.

Businesses

5.5  Climate change will present both challenges and opportunities for businesses. Research 
undertaken for Defra by the Carbon Disclosure Project found that 80% of  responding 
FTSE 100 companies identified substantive risks to their business as a result of  climate 
change.8 However fewer than half  of  FTSE 100 companies incorporate climate adaptation or 
equivalent into their business strategies.


 

5.6  The ARP does not apply to the vast majority of  businesses. However Defra is engaging 
with the Carbon Disclosure Project to raise the profile of  adaptation through its annual 
questionnaire to companies on the behalf  of  investors. Lessons from the ARP process will 
be used to highlight examples of  best practice in adaptation so that business as a whole 
becomes more resilient. Further work on businesses and adaptation is set out in the business 
chapter of  the National Adaptation Programme report.

Homes and Communities Agency

5.7  The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) is the national housing and regeneration agency 
for England. HCA is also the regulator for social housing providers in England, focusing 
on governance, financial viability and value for money as the basis for robust economic 
regulation. The Climate Change Risk Assessment identified a number of  risks relevant to 
the HCA. In response HCA has made a corporate plan commitment to support the National 
Adaptation Programme.9 It has also published a Design and Sustainability Business Plan.10 
HCA will not be invited to report under the ARP to avoid duplication of  existing reporting 
arrangements. 

Fire and rescue authorities

5.8  Services are delivered in England by forty six fire and rescue authorities of  differing size 
and structure. Central government provides a statutory framework and allocates financial 
resources through Revenue Support Grant and other means. Government also funds them to 
deliver a national resilience capability.

5.9  The Climate Change Risk Assessment identified that the emergency and fire services will 
experience increased demand in responding to severe weather events linked to climate 
change, such as flooding. It also identified a specific risk around the incidence and severity of  
wildfires which is predicted to have knock-on demand on fire and rescue authorities. 

5.10  Each fire and rescue authority must produce an Integrated Risk Management Plan that 
identifies and assesses all foreseeable fire and rescue related risks that could affect its 
community, including those of  a cross-border, multi-authority and/or national nature. The 
plan must have regard to the community risk registers produced by Local Resilience Forums 
and any other local risk analyses as appropriate. Given the scope of  the Integrated Risk 
Management Planning process, the Secretary of  State will not be inviting individual fire 
and rescue authorities to report under the ARP to avoid duplication of  existing reporting 
arrangements.

6.1  Government has given the Environment Agency a specific role to provide advice and support 
to businesses and public sector organisations in England to help them adapt to the changing 
climate. The service, called Climate Ready, complements the Environment Agency’s existing 
roles and responsibilities. This role builds on the work which was previously undertaken by the 
UK Climate Impacts Programme. Different arrangements are in place in Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland, the detail is set out in Section 8.

6.2  The Climate Ready support service provides:

 • information about how the climate of  the UK may change
 • guidance and advice on carrying out climate change impacts assessments
 •  guidance and advice on identifying and evaluating climate change adaptation strategies 

and decisions

 •  a helpdesk to answer queries on climate change planning as well as provide technical 
support on the UK Climate Projections

6.3  In delivering the Climate Ready service the Environment Agency will:

 •  work with and through other government delivery bodies, service providers and sector 
representatives to understand what is needed

 •  work in partnership with national organisations and local networks
 •  develop practical guidance and tools to help organisations identify and evaluate climate 

change adaptation strategies, including how to assess the costs and benefits of  different 
options

 •  help build capacity within organisations through training, professional development and 
peer-to-peer learning 

 •  talk to users and practitioners about their needs for future climate projections to ensure 
their requirements are met

 •  develop a set of  adaptation case studies to demonstrate how organisations are taking 
practical action to adapt

 •  work with research councils, universities and other organisations to ensure our service has 
access to the latest science

6.4  Government will continue to discuss with reporting authorities how it, the Environment Agency 
and others involved in delivering the National Adaptation Programme, like Climate Change 
Partnerships and Climate UK, can encourage and support them to produce and implement 
adaptation reports. The government will provide voluntary guidance to help organisations 
to prepare their reports. Example reporting frameworks will be developed for use by 
organisations which would value this.

7.1  As required by Section 65 of  the Climate Change Act 2008, the Secretary of  State must 
outline the circumstances in which directions to report might be given that are not indicated 
within this document. This section outlines the circumstances which may result in requests to 
report being given to authorities. These circumstances are:

 •  where a future event exposes vulnerability
 •  where evidence is obtained of  bodies’ poor performance to reduce vulnerability to climate 

change

 •  where a new body is created that fulfils the criteria outlined in Section 2 or
 •  where an existing body’s role changes so that it fits these criteria

Where a future event, or increase in available evidence, exposes previously 
unidentified vulnerability

7.2  It is possible that an extreme weather event of  similar severity to the 2007 summer floods, the 
2003 heat wave or the 2012 drought may occur and highlight the vulnerability of  organisations 
or sectors not currently included as reporting authorities. If  such an event occurs it is 
important that the government can act quickly to respond to any additional vulnerabilities 
highlighted. 

7.3  The government therefore reserves the right to ask reporting authorities, not currently 
included, to report if  future events display a previously unidentified vulnerability in a sector or 
organisation.

Where there is evidence that an authority is not performing to a regulators’ required 
standard against objectives to reduce vulnerability to climate change

7.4  Where organisations have an alternative regulatory regime that incorporates adaptation, 
their performance against those standards can be assessed. Where a key organisation is 
assessed by its regulators to be failing in fulfilling its adaptation requirements, it will be open 
to the Secretary of  State to request an adaptation report under the Adaptation Reporting 
Power. 

Where a new body is created that fulfils the criteria

7.5  Section 3 outlined criteria under which an authority may be invited to report. New bodies are 
created under statute or licences passed to new authorities regularly. For this reason the 
Secretary of  State might require or invite any new organisation to report that fulfils the criteria 
outlined in Section 3.

Where an existing body’s role changes so that it fits the criteria

7.6  As for new bodies, a public authority’s role or statutory functions are subject to change. For 
this reason the Secretary of  State might require or invite any organisation to report where its 
functions change so that it fits the criteria set out in Section 3.

6.1  Government has given the Environment Agency a specific role to provide advice and support 
to businesses and public sector organisations in England to help them adapt to the changing 
climate. The service, called Climate Ready, complements the Environment Agency’s existing 
roles and responsibilities. This role builds on the work which was previously undertaken by the 
UK Climate Impacts Programme. Different arrangements are in place in Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland, the detail is set out in Section 8.

6.2  The Climate Ready support service provides:

 • information about how the climate of  the UK may change
 • guidance and advice on carrying out climate change impacts assessments
 •  guidance and advice on identifying and evaluating climate change adaptation strategies 

and decisions

 •  a helpdesk to answer queries on climate change planning as well as provide technical 
support on the UK Climate Projections

6.3  In delivering the Climate Ready service the Environment Agency will:

 •  work with and through other government delivery bodies, service providers and sector 
representatives to understand what is needed

 •  work in partnership with national organisations and local networks
 •  develop practical guidance and tools to help organisations identify and evaluate climate 

change adaptation strategies, including how to assess the costs and benefits of  different 
options

 •  help build capacity within organisations through training, professional development and 
peer-to-peer learning 

 •  talk to users and practitioners about their needs for future climate projections to ensure 
their requirements are met

 •  develop a set of  adaptation case studies to demonstrate how organisations are taking 
practical action to adapt

 •  work with research councils, universities and other organisations to ensure our service has 
access to the latest science

6.4  Government will continue to discuss with reporting authorities how it, the Environment Agency 
and others involved in delivering the National Adaptation Programme, like Climate Change 
Partnerships and Climate UK, can encourage and support them to produce and implement 
adaptation reports. The government will provide voluntary guidance to help organisations 
to prepare their reports. Example reporting frameworks will be developed for use by 
organisations which would value this.

7.1  As required by Section 65 of  the Climate Change Act 2008, the Secretary of  State must 
outline the circumstances in which directions to report might be given that are not indicated 
within this document. This section outlines the circumstances which may result in requests to 
report being given to authorities. These circumstances are:

 •  where a future event exposes vulnerability
 •  where evidence is obtained of  bodies’ poor performance to reduce vulnerability to climate 

change

 •  where a new body is created that fulfils the criteria outlined in Section 2 or
 •  where an existing body’s role changes so that it fits these criteria

Where a future event, or increase in available evidence, exposes previously 
unidentified vulnerability

7.2  It is possible that an extreme weather event of  similar severity to the 2007 summer floods, the 
2003 heat wave or the 2012 drought may occur and highlight the vulnerability of  organisations 
or sectors not currently included as reporting authorities. If  such an event occurs it is 
important that the government can act quickly to respond to any additional vulnerabilities 
highlighted. 

7.3  The government therefore reserves the right to ask reporting authorities, not currently 
included, to report if  future events display a previously unidentified vulnerability in a sector or 
organisation.

Where there is evidence that an authority is not performing to a regulators’ required 
standard against objectives to reduce vulnerability to climate change

7.4  Where organisations have an alternative regulatory regime that incorporates adaptation, 
their performance against those standards can be assessed. Where a key organisation is 
assessed by its regulators to be failing in fulfilling its adaptation requirements, it will be open 
to the Secretary of  State to request an adaptation report under the Adaptation Reporting 
Power.

7.5  Section 3 outlined criteria under which an authority may be invited to report. New bodies are 
created under statute or licences passed to new authorities regularly. For this reason the 
Secretary of  State might require or invite any new organisation to report that fulfils the criteria 
outlined in Section 3.

Where an existing body’s role changes so that it fits the criteria

7.6  As for new bodies, a public authority’s role or statutory functions are subject to change. For 
this reason the Secretary of  State might require or invite any organisation to report where its 
functions change so that it fits the criteria set out in Section 3.

8.1  The strategy for the exercise of  this power has been developed following discussion with 
officials from the Devolved Administrations.

8.2  All relevant sections and Schedules of  the Climate Change Act 2008 extend to the whole of  
the UK, except as stated in the Act. The Secretary of  State has the power to issue directions 
to report to reporting authorities in Devolved Administrations but cannot give directions 
relating to a reporting authority’s devolved functions.

8.3  The power can only be used on authorities whose functions are in England or are outside 
England and relate to reserved matters in Scotland, non devolved matters in Wales and 
reserved and excepted matters in Northern Ireland.

8.4  Some of  the functions exercised by these authorities in the Devolved Administrations 
relate to matters which are not fully devolved. The Devolved Administration still has some 
joint or concurrent control over these functions with a Minister of  the Crown, or there are 
requirements for consent or consultation. 

8.5  The legal obligations of  the Secretary of  State to consult or obtain consent before he may 
give directions relating to these functions are set out in Section 64 of  the Act. In practice, 
requirements to gain consent or consult vary on a case by case basis and the Secretary of  
State will consult with or request consent from Devolved Administrations on those issues with 
consultation, consenting or joint/concurrent control requirements prior to invitations to report 
being issued.

8.6  As this reporting round is taking a voluntary approach and the Secretary of  State is not 
intending to give directions to reporting authorities, there are no conflicts with Devolved 
Administrations over reserved, non devolved or excepted matters.

Corresponding powers

Wales

8.7  The Act provides the power to Welsh Ministers to issue directions to report and produce 
Statutory Guidance, mirroring the Secretary of  State’s powers, for reporting authorities’ 
devolved functions in Wales. There are similar requirements on Wales to gain consent from or 
consult with the Secretary of  State on any issues overlapping with those of  other authorities.

8.8  The Act also provides Welsh Ministers with the power to issue guidance to which reporting 
authorities must have regard when preparing an adaptation report, if  they have functions that 
are exercisable in Wales, or have devolved functions.

8.9  Welsh Ministers have not directed any reporting authorities to prepare reports. However 
they are supporting organisations in Wales to assess and manage climate risks by issuing 
statutory guidance and by providing advice and tools through an Adaptation Knowledge 
Transfer Programme.11

8.10  Parts 1 and 2 of  the guidance provide a step-by-step approach to developing a planned 
response to the threats and opportunities presented by climate change. The guidance draws 
on the latest international research and good practice in this area. The Welsh Government 
has adopted the same approach for developing parts 3 to 5 of  the guidance, which were 
published in the first half  of  2013.

8.11  The Welsh Government would expect any organisation that either has functions exercisable in 
Wales or carries out devolved Welsh functions to have regard to its guidance when preparing 
statutory or voluntary adaptation reports.

8.12  The Welsh Government’s approach to preparing for a changing climate is set out in the Welsh 
Government’s Climate Change Strategy first published in 2010 and reviewed on an annual 
basis.12 The approach to using the powers in the Climate Change Act relating to adaptation 
and the approach to knowledge transfer is set out in the Strategy and its First Annual Report 
(March 2012).

8.13  Organisations in Wales seeking advice and support on how best to prepare for a changing 
climate can contact the Climate Change team at the Welsh Government.

Northern Ireland

8.14  The Climate Change Act 2008 does not give any powers to Northern Ireland Ministers 
(by contrast with the situation in Wales) and no similar power is available under any other 
legislation.

8.15  Therefore the only power applicable in Northern Ireland is the Secretary of  State’s power to 
issue guidance and directions to reporting authorities in relation to a reporting authority’s non-
devolved functions. In practice, many issues in Northern Ireland are completely reserved and 
devolved, so the powers of  the Climate Change Act 2008, in relation to the ARP, are relatively 
limited in scope. Requesting consent or consultation may apply where this is not the case, as 
set out above. 

8.16  As required under Section 60 of  the Climate Change Act 2008, Northern Ireland is developing 
a Northern Ireland Adaptation Programme (NIAP) which will address the threats and 
opportunities identified in the Climate Change Risk Assessment. The NIAP will be laid before 
the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2013.

Scotland

8.18  The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 gained Royal Assent on 4 August 2009. Section 
44 of  the Act places a duty on ‘public bodies’, when exercising their functions, to act in a way 
which is best calculated to:

 •  deliver on emission targets
 •  deliver on an Adaptation Programme laid under Section 53 of  the Act, in a way which 

is sustainable

8.19  These duties came into force on 1 January 2011 and apply to all ‘public bodies’, defined as a 
Scottish public authority within the meaning of  Section 3(1) (a) of  the Freedom of  Information 
(Scotland) Act 2002 (as amended). The Scottish Government published guidance on the 
public bodies’ duties on 4 February 2011.14

8.20  The Scottish Act also allows Scottish Ministers, by Order, to impose other climate change 
duties, to require reports on compliance with climate change duties and to designate one or 
more bodies or persons to monitor compliance and to carry out investigations.

8.21  Work is currently underway by the Scottish Government to develop a Scottish Adaptation 
Programme and this will be consulted on in 2013. This will build on the Scottish Government’s 
Climate Change Adaptation Framework (published in 2009) and will respond to climate 
change impacts for devolved areas in Scotland.15

8.22  Any Scottish organisation seeking advice or support on how best to adapt to a changing 
climate can contact Adaptation Scotland, an advice service funded by the Scottish 
Government.16
