change continues, the negative impacts 
(including more frequent winter floods,

Overall, there will be both positive and 
negative impacts on every aspect of 
our economy, society and environment. 
A series of regional scoping studies for 
the UK has been undertaken, supported 
by the UKCIP. These identified a range 
of impacts10, including: 

Critical national infrastructure

increased risk of summer water 
shortages; increase in water quality 
problems. 

•	 solid waste management – increased 
rate of degradation and leaching at 
landfill sites. 

•	 transport – less risk of disruption 
from cold weather and fog, increased 
pressure on infrastructure due to 
heat, changing rainfall patterns and 
extreme weather events. 

•	 energy infrastructure and networks 
vulnerable to flooding, storms and 
extreme heat.

 Public services 
•	 emergency planning and security 

– increased risk of extreme weather

Case Study – Jeskyns 
Situated between Gravesend and Cobham, North Kent, Jeskyns is �60 acres 
(147 hectares) of greenspace that has been created by the Forestry Commision. 

Within Jeskyns is a project that demonstrates one approach to ensuring that 
new woodlands are resilient to climate change. 

They have set up a new woodland and planted trees in two areas: one 
area made up of native species and the other containing a different mix of 
native species that are likely to be more resilient to hotter and drier climates, 
augmented by a small proportion of non native species. 

The aim is to create a diverse woodland, which is resilient and able to adapt to 
predicted climate change, but one which does not change the nature of a native 
woodland landscape and will continue to provide habitats for the familiar British 
species of butterflies, birds and insects.

the need for action 


16 


What is “adapting 
to climate change”? 
We will need to adapt the way we 
do things in order to respond to the 
changing circumstances presented by 
climate change. This is not just about 
protecting against threats, but should 
also enhance our ability to optimise 
any benefits. Adaptation is distinct 
from mitigation, yet both are needed to 
meet the long-term challenge of climate 
change. Without strong and early 
mitigation, the physical limits to, and 
costs of adaptation will grow rapidly. 
In addition, the way we adapt to 
climate change can have impacts on the 
success of our mitigation. For example, 
it is counter-productive to respond to 
rising temperatures through greater use 
of mechanical air conditioning powered 
by electricity from a source with a high 
carbon footprint. Equally, mitigation 
efforts such as developing renewable 
energy sources should be built with the 
future climate in mind. 

the need for action




It is, therefore, essential that we do 
more to build adaptation into our 
decision-making now. Government, 
business, the third sector and individuals 
are already starting to do so, and the 
Government wants to ensure that 
everyone is considering the cost and 
benefits of adaptation in economic, 
social and environmental terms.  

There will be costs associated with both 
the impacts themselves and adaptation. 
Different issues will require responses 
on different timescales, with a view to 
identifying the most cost-effective way 
forward. The response we make will 
depend both on when the impact hits, 
but also on the appropriate planning 
horizon. Large investment projects 
in assets that will last for 100 years 
will need a different approach to the 
decision on which crop to grow next 
year. However, we won’t always be 
able to remove all the risks completely 
by adapting. 

Redhill School 
The redevelopment of Redhill School, Worcestershire is one of the first in England 
to have a climate change impact assessment carried out from the start of the 
design process. The £2.7 million project involves a replacement primary school 
on the site of the former 1960s building. The school aims to have a low carbon 
building that is able to cope with climate change to maintain a comfortable and 
robust teaching environment over its lifetime. 

Some of the adaptation features of the school to help it to withstand 
climate change impacts include: 
• A sustainable urban drainage scheme using swales, ponds and underground 

box storage. 
• A rainwater harvesting scheme, used for flushing toilets, takes rain from 

approximately half the roof area. Other roof areas have a planted roof finish 
(sedum) to reduce run-off. 

• Shade is provided by overhanging eaves and external canopies to the 
classrooms. Roof coverings are zinc sheet with standing seams which 
may be less vulnerable to high winds than roofing tiles.

The challenge is made more difficult 
by an inevitable level of uncertainty. 
Any scenarios for potential future 
changes cannot be certain: they show 
a range of plausible futures but cannot 
predict exactly what will happen. Our 
understanding of what is happening 
in relation to climate change and other 
important areas that impact on our 
lives (population growth, economy, 
technology) will develop over time. 
As with any other decision, to be 
sustainable we will need to continually 
revisit our approach to adaptation 
and review the decisions that have 
been made. 

Vulnerability and Resilience 
Vulnerability can be defined as being 
open to or at risk of damage. It relates 
to the characteristics of the object on 
the receiving end of the impact – the 
“receptor” – which make it more or 
less likely to be adversely affected by 
a particular impact of climate change. 
A particular change can have a very 

different effect on different receptors 
– leading to different risk levels. 

For example, high temperatures could 
cause damage to particular road surfaces 
but not to others because of the different 
melting point of the material used, and 
whether the road is exposed or mostly 
in shade due to roadside trees. The 
significance of the impact will depend 
on whether it is a country road without 
much traffic, or a major urban trunk road. 

It is important to emphasise the 
complex and interconnected nature of 
systems within our society, the economy 
and the environment. An impact 
can lead to a chain of other impacts 
affecting several different aspects of 
our lives. We therefore need to look 
holistically at the systems (ecological 
and human) affected by climate 
change. For example, the immediate 
chain of impacts from flooding might 
be disrupted supply chains, water­
borne diseases increasing, damage to 

important natural habitats and staff 
not able to get to work. The knock on 
consequences of these impacts could 
be schools closing, children having to 
be looked after at home, parents (who 
could be bus drivers, teachers at other 
schools or production engineers) missing 
work and therefore disruption to a wider 
sector of society and the economy. 
Ensuring we have the capacity to reduce 
disruption and deal with the remaining 
consequences can be desribed as 
building resilience. 

Adaptation responses 
We will all make certain adjustments to 
adapt to the changing climate without 
Government intervention, as is the 
case with any other kind of change. 
The rationale for the Government to 
intervene in this activity is to enable 
the country at large to maximise the 
benefits and minimise the costs of 
adaptation – particularly by addressing 
barriers to adaptation. 


18 

Climate change is a risk amongst 
many to our collective well-being and 
prosperity. We want to ensure that we 
adapt in the most sustainable manner, 
basing decisions on sound science, risk 
analysis, understanding of vulnerabilities, 
and an examination of the knock-on 
effects (including costs and benefits) 
on other parts of the system – i.e. on 
other organisations and the natural 
environment. In building resilience 
we need to avoid becoming too 
locked to particular approaches, so 
we can be flexible enough to deal 
with changing challenges from the 
climate or other factors. 

Adapting to climate change needs to 
be part of every organisational risk 
assessment and business planning 
process. Different adaptation options 
might be appropriate to a particular 
organisation at a particular time. The 
choice will be dependent on the costs 
and benefits of different options, the 
attitude to risk of the organisation and 

the information that is available to it. 
The outcome of the adaptation decision 
is likely to have impacts beyond the 
organisation that makes it. 

For example, for a school facing 
high summer temperatures, options 
might include living with the heat 
(but providing easier access to tap 
water), fitting appropriate shading 
and ventilation, or even changing the 
timetable in terms of midday hours to 
avoid the highest temperatures. In many 
cases the knock-on effects of different 
adaptation responses on other parts 
of our society, economy or enviroment 
could be very varied.

Case Study: 

Tourism in the South West


 

In the South West, temperature change may lead to a longer, warmer summer 
season which could be beneficial for tourism. Kitley House Hotel in Devon has 
undertaken a number of adaptation actions to ensure they are able to withstand 
the effects of climate change and maximise the opportunities. These include: 

• investing time in the management of the estate – e.g. the company 
has raised access pathways beside water; 

• changed landscaping to create habitats to attract wildlife; and 
• integrated water efficiency and improved drainage measures. 

As well as saving £1�,000 a year through these new environmental management 
actions, the hotel has attracted more customers due to the wildlife and ‘green’ 
credentials and has been given a Silver award by South Hams Green Business 
Tourism Scheme.

The role of Government 
Raising awareness of the changing 
climate will encourage people to adapt 
their behaviour to reduce the potential 
costs as well as to take advantage of 
any opportunities. The Government’s 
Adapting to Climate Change (ACC) 
Programme has been set up to ensure 
that organisations and individuals 
are as well equipped as possible 
to navigate through these 
complexities and make the most 
effective and sustainable 
adaptation decisions. 

The Stern Review looked at some of 
the possible barriers to adaptation. It 
highlighted uncertainty and lack of 
information, missing and misaligned 
markets (such as public goods) and 
financial constraints as three broad 
barriers to adaptation. (See text box on 
page 11.) The Government has a role in 
tackling these issues through providing 
the right institutional environment 


20 

to help enable organisations and 
individuals make effective and efficient 
adaptation decisions. The Programme 
is providing information on climate 
change risks and impacts, tools and 
methodologies, through this document, 
through the Adapting to Climate 
Change website, and particularly 
through the work of UKCIP. These 
resources are all available free of charge 
to the user in order to encourage take 
up of information and assistance. 

Some barriers to effective and efficient 
adaptation will be more challenging 
and complex, and will need to be 
addressed within relevant policy areas. 
For example, Defra’s flood and coastal 
erosion risk management programme 
helps provides protection for properties 
where, because some flood defences 
have public good characteristics, the 
market might not be expected to 
provide sufficient defence. Government 
also has a role in supporting some 

important public goods, such as the 
natural environment, and so Defra, 
through the Environment Agency 
and Natural England funds work to 
increase the resilience of our natural 
and built environment. 

The need for equity and social justice, 
in light of the financial constraints 
identified by Stern, in adapting to 
climate change is also acknowledged 
and will be considered further. For 
example, climate change could push 
new groups of people into social 
exclusion as well as putting pressure 
on poorer individuals and communities. 

As Sir Michael Pitt recently set out, 
Government leadership on adapting 
to the impacts of climate change 
is imperative. 

Individuals, businesses, public and third 
sector organisations all need to take 
responsibility for how climate change will 

affect them. Government cannot do this 
on their behalf but it can help set the 
right framework to allow them to make 
the appropriate decisions to adapt in 
an efficent and cost-effective way. This 
collective effort will benefit us all, but the 
most significant benefits will be to those 
who plan early to adapt to the changes. 

Government will take clear and firm 
action to ensure that its processes and 
organisations are adapting and that its 
policies, programmes and investment 
decisions are made in the context 
of climate change. The Government 
will ensure that key public sector 
organisations, responsible for national 
infrastructure, public services and 
wellbeing, or which are believed to 
be particularly vulnerable, are making 
adequate progress in that task. It will 
do this through a variety of reporting 
and enforcement mechanisms – local 
authority indicators, other regulatory 
regimes, and the new reporting power in

The Climate Change Bill 
The Climate Change Bill will make the UK the first country in the world to have 
a legally binding long term framework to cut CO


2

 emissions and adapt to climate 

change. The Bill is currently making its way through Parliament, and is expected 
to become an Act by the end of 2008. 

The Bill will create a new approach to managing and responding to climate change 
in the UK through: setting ambitious targets for reducing emissions, taking powers 
to help achieve them, and strengthening the institutional framework. 

It will also enhance the UK’s ability to adapt to the impact of 
climate change by: 
•	 requiring Government to assess the risks climate change poses to the UK at least 

every five years, with the first Climate Change Risk Assessment due in 2011 (see 
page �0); 

•	 requiring Government to publish and regularly update a national adaptation 
programme to address those risks, covering England and reserved matters. 
The first statutory Programme is expected in 2012 (see page 25); 

•	 allowing the Government to require public authorities and statutory undertakers 
to assess, where necessary, the risks of climate change to their work and set out 
what action they need to take in response (see page 41); 

•	 requiring the Government to produce guidance on how to undertake a climate 
risk assessment and draw up an adaptation action plan (see page �4); and 

•	 establishing an Adaptation Sub-Committee of the independent Committee on 
Climate Change in order to oversee progress on the Programme and advise on 
the Climate Change Risk Assessment (see page 42) 

the Climate Change Bill. By these routes, 
and through reporting on its Programme 
to Parliament, the Government will 
ensure that adaptation becomes 
embedded across the public sector. 

Government will also work with third 
sector organisations who undertake 
a range of important roles including 
raising awareness, campaigning, 
providing services to vulnerable people 
and helping individuals change their 
behaviour. We will ensure the sector 
receives the information and tools 
they need to adapt their work 
and assets to a changing climate.

The Government’s 
Adapting to Climate 
Change (ACC) Programme 
brings together the work 
already being led by 
Government and the wider 
public sector on adapting 
to climate change, and 
will co-ordinate and drive 
forward the development 
of the Government’s 
work on this in the future. 
The Programme is led by 
the Department for the 
Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs (Defra), which 
acts as central co-ordinator 
for the Programme.

the Adapting to climate 
change Programme 
THE PHASE 1 PROGRAMME: 2008-2011 


24

The objectives of Phase 1 
of the Programme are to: 

•	 develop a more robust and 
comprehensive evidence base about 
the impacts and consequences of 
climate change on the UK; 

•	 raise awareness of the need to 
take action now and help others 
to take action; 

•	 measure success and take steps 
to ensure effective delivery; and 

•	 work across Government at the 
national, regional and local level to 
embed adaptation into Government 
policies, programme and systems. 

The Programme is in two phases. 
Phase 1, from 2008-2011 will lay the 
groundwork necessary to implement 
Phase 2 – a statutory National 
Adaptation Programme, as required 
by the Climate Change Bill. Phase 2 
will be developed during Phase 1, 
but will be finalised once the Climate 
Change Risk Assessment provides us 
with fuller evidence of the key risks to 
the UK. The Government’s intention is to 
have the Phase 2 statutory Programme in 
place by 2012 at the latest, to fulfil the 
requirements of the Climate Change Bill. 
The Programme will then report progress 
to Parliament on a regular basis. 

The Programme is focused on England, 
though some elements will be UK-
wide, and will therefore be developed 
in partnership with the other UK 
Administrations. The Programme is 
essentially domestic in scope. However, 
the consequences of climate change 
in other countries, and their ability to 
adapt, will have an impact on the UK, 

because of the interconnected nature 
of our globalised world (for example 
in relation to trade, regional security, 
food production and migration issues). 
The Programme will therefore address 
those effects where there is potentially 
a significant domestic impact from 
international developments. 

We need a better understanding of the 
implications for the UK of climate change 
impacts across the world. The forthcoming 
Climate Change Risk Assessment will 
make use of the best current evidence 
of these impacts on the UK. 

Defra is working closely with DfID and 
the FCO on understanding the impacts 
and helping less developed countries 
adapt. Other areas of Government will 
also undertake further research on the 
effect of global impacts on the UK and 
its policies. In particular the Ministry 
of Defence will factor climate change 
effects into long-term planning, as 
well as working with the FCO to take

The UK and 
International Adaptation 

Through the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change the 
UK is working to develop a coherent 
international response for adaptation. 
The current round of negotiations is 
expected to last until December 2009, 
when we hope to agree a long-term 
international framework to tackle climate 
change. Further information about the 
UK Government’s action on international 
adaptation can be found on Defra’s 
website: http://www.defra.gov.uk/ 
environment/climatechange/index.htm 
and on the website of the Department for 
International Development: http://www. 
dfid.gov.uk/news/files/climate-bali.asp 

forward a programme of research into 
the security implications of climate 
change. 

European Union work 
on adaptation 
The European Commission has an 
important leadership role to play to 
ensure that all EU programmes take 
full account of the changing climate. 
A Green Paper, “Adapting to climate 
change in Europe – options for EU 
action”, was published in June 2007. The 
Green Paper set out four lines of priority 
actions (or pillars) to be considered: 

•	 early action to develop adaptation 
strategies in areas where current 
knowledge is sufficient; 

• integrating global adaptation needs 
into the EU’s external relations and 
building a new alliance with partners 
around the world; 

•	 setting up a European advisory group 
on adaptation to climate change to 
analyse co-ordinated strategies 
and actions. 

This consultation ran until December 
2007 and EU officials are now 
working on a White Paper. 

The Adapting to Climate Change 
(ACC) Programme will take the lead, 
in co-ordination with the other UK 
Administrations, in providing input to 
the EU White Paper, in order to ensure 
that any EU action on adaptation is in 
line with and supports the principles 
and objectives of the Programme. We 
will also work in tandem with other UK 
policy officials to try and help the EU 
embed adaptation in its wider policy 
areas – for example in the critical areas 
of Common Agricultural Policy reform, 
in the design of the next EU budget, as 
well as in environmental, health 
and other policies. 


26 


• filling knowledge gaps on adaptation 
through EU-level research and 
exchange of information; and 




The Programme’s principles 
the Programme will be guided by a set of core principles. it will be: 

Sustainable 
• Adaptive action should follow 

the principles of sustainable 
development, in particular ensuring 
that the needs of the natural 
environment, society and the 
economy are all acknowledged and 
protected (see page �2). 

Proportionate and integrated 
• Action must relate to the level of risk 

and be proportionate, and must be 
taken on the appropriate timescale 
and when the benefits are greater 
than the costs. 

• The impacts will vary across the 
country, and action will need to be 
taken at the most appropriate level 
– this will often be regionally and 
locally rather than nationally. 

• Assessing climate change risks 
and opportunities should become 
‘business as usual’– part of normal 
risk management, and business 
planning. 

Collaborative and open 
Adapting to climate change is a 
challenge for the whole of our economy 
and society, and will require action from 
a range of individuals and organisations 
across sectors – and not Government 
alone. The Programme will: 

• provide leadership by making 
evidence and information available, 
and addressing other significant 
barriers to adaptation 

• contribute to and encourage 
partnerships and stakeholder led 
action at national, regional and 
local levels 

• provide clarity on what the 
Government is doing, why and when.

the Programme: 
Phase 1 2008-2011 

Phase 1 of the Adapting 
to Climate Change 
Programme is divided 
into four workstreams, 
reflecting the objectives 
described on page 25. 

The workstreams are: 

A: Providing the evidence 

B: Raising awareness, and 
helping others take action 

C: Ensuring and measuring 
progress 

D: Government policy and 
process: embedding 
adaptation 

The following paragraphs explain what 
is currently being planned under each 
workstream.

There is a growing body of research 
about the likely impact of climate 
change on different regions and sectors 
of the UK, such as flood risk, effects 
on biodiversity, transport, and critical 
infrastructure. However, to date there 
is no one source examining the risks 
of climate change to different regions 

and sectors to give a comprehensive 
national overview. 

To address this gap the Climate Change 
Bill commits the UK Government to 
carrying out an assessment of the risks 
of climate change. It will build on the 
existing body of evidence, identify gaps 
in our knowledge, and help prioritise 
our strategic objectives. It will look at 
current vulnerabilities, future impacts 
and adaptive capacity. The first UK 
Climate Change Risk Assessment will 
make use of the most recent and robust 
evidence and is due within three years 
of the Climate Change Bill gaining Royal 
Assent. After this, a further Climate 
Change Risk Assessment will be carried 
out every five years, in order to inform 
the statutory National Adaptation 
Programme on an ongoing basis. 

The primary aim of the Climate Change 
Risk Assessment is to inform all UK 
Administrations, and their delivery 

partners, about the risks of climate 
change. It will also look at a high level at 
the costs that might be associated with 
those risks. This will help set priorities for 
adaptation programmes, and make sure 
that other policies reflect the potential 
risks and opportunities presented by 
climate change. It will also help others 
to hold Government to account in 
addressing these risks and provide 
valuable information for the wider public, 
private and third sector about risks 
and opportunities. There will be public 
consultation on the Risk Assessment 
before it is presented to Parliament. 

This is one of the most ambitious 
assessments undertaken worldwide, 
and will need to make some important 
steps forward in developing the 
methodology for such national studies. 
It is certain to identify many areas for 
further research. More details on this 
and other adaptation research are 
available on Defra’s website.

c) Costing the risks and 
opportunities from climate change 
The Stern Review highlighted that 
“more quantitative information on the 
costs and benefits of economy-wide 
adaptation is required”. 

Therefore, the Government is planning 
to undertake a national Cost-Benefit 
Analysis of adaptation, to complement 
the Climate Change Risk Assessment. 
Developing the evidence base on the 
costs and benefits of adaptation is 
an important step towards gaining a 
better understanding of how best to 
approach adaptation to the impacts of 
climate change, examining objectively 
the risks and opportunities of climate 
change and how they compare to 
other challenges. 

Environment Agency’s Climate Change 
Adaptation Strategy. 
The Environment Agency has had a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy since 2005, 
which sets out a systematic approach for embedding climate change adaptation into 
their core business planning, providing a strategic framework for assessing climate 
risk, building adaptive capacity, identifying adaptation options and ensuring co­
ordinated delivery. Work to date has focused on priority business areas, such as Flood 
Risk Management, Water Resources, Freshwater Ecology, Water Framework Directive, 
Waste, Land Quality and Monitoring. Examples of activity underway include – 

• The next revision of National Flood Risk Assessment (NAFRA) will include new 
climate change science and forthcoming scenarios from the UK Climate Impacts 
Programme (UKCIP08) 

• Revised climate change allowances in Flood Risk Appraisal guidance, 
incorporating regional variations 

• A map of river flows up to 2050 
• An assessment of the climate vulnerability of all Biodiversity Action Plan species 
• Project to examine how waste management sites will be affected by future 

climate change and how better management practices may alleviate the 
increased risks this poses for the environment and human health 

• Influencing the development of agri-environment schemes to include options 
for water efficiency, rural Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems and better soil 
management.

The ACC Programme and Sustainable Development 

The 2005 UK sustainable development 
strategy, Securing the Future sets out 
the shared principles of sustainable 
development in the UK, and the work 
of the Government’s ACC Programme 
will be underpinned by these principles: 

Living within environmental limits 
• Ensuring that any actions take into 

account the possible impacts on natural 
resources, biodiversity and whole 
ecosystems, do not reduce the adaptive 
capacity of the natural environment 
and wherever possible improve or 
enhance their resilience; and ensuring 
adaptation measures are not carbon 
or energy intensive, but wherever 
possible rely on and further more 
low-carbon, energy efficient and 
resource efficient technologies; 

Ensuring a strong, healthy 
and just society 
• Ensuring that adaptation measures 

do not disproportionately affect any 
particular group, and that the wellbeing 
and health of people is at the centre of 
adapting to climate change; 

Achieving a sustainable economy 
• Helping set a framework that allows 

the economy to adjust to changes 
in climate effectively, maximising 
opportunities and minimising threats; 

Promoting good governance 
• Where appropriate, communities 

should be empowered to influence 
adaptation and take appropriate 
action for themselves; 

Using sound science responsibly 
• Allowing for flexibility to reflect the 

inherent uncertainty: climate scenarios 
show a range of plausible futures and 
are not predictions, and they interact 
and will be affected by other uncertain 
events. However, the precautionary 
principle needs to be applied so 
that uncertainty does not delay 
necessary action.

The ACC Programme and Sustainable Development Whilst the Cost-Benefit Analysis is not 
part of the statutory programme, it will 
be closely linked to the Climate Change 
Risk Assessment. The Risk Assessment 
will provide inputs into the Cost-Benefit 
Analysis of the costs of the projected 
impacts of climate change; the Cost-
Benefit Analysis will then look at the 
costs of taking adaptive action, and the 
benefits that could be expected from 
these actions. 

B: Raising awareness of the 
need to take action now, and 
helping others to take action 
A comprehensive evidence base is 
essential, but it is only effective if it is 
well-used. Individuals and organisations 
need to know that there is an issue that 
needs to be addressed, how to find the 
information that they need, and how 
to use it. 

The Programme will therefore work 
with a range of organisations from the 
public, private and third sectors to: 
•	 raise awareness of the need 

for action; 
• provide and promote the information 

and tools needed to take action; and 
• build capacity and capability within 

organisations to understand the 
impacts of climate change and 
take action. 

The Adapting to Climate Change 
website will help people to find the 
information, advice and tools they need. 

a) The UK Climate Impacts 
Programme (UKCIP) 
A major aim of UKCIP is to increase the 
uptake and understanding of research 
related to climate change impacts 
and adaptation for the UK. UKCIP has 
developed a range of tools – available 
free of charge – to help organisations, 
including the: 

•	 Adaptation Wizard: this helps 
organisations to determine 
vulnerability to climate change, 
identify key climate risks, and develop 
a climate change adaptation strategy; 

•	 Business assessment tool: this 
helps explore the implications of 
climate change for a particular 
business or sector; and 

•	 Local Climate Impacts Profile: this 
is a resource that Local Authorities 
can use to understand better their 
exposure to weather and climate. 

The ACC Programme will work with 
UKCIP to help make sure that these 
tools (which also include the UKCIP02 
and UKCIP08 scenarios) reach as 
wide an audience as possible, including 
all Government Departments and 
their agencies. 


�� 

b) Guidance on assessing the 
risks of climate change and 
taking action 
The Climate Change Bill will allow the 
Government to require public authorities 
and statutory undertakers to undertake 
an assessment of the risks that climate 
change poses to their organisations, and 
develop an action plan. Whilst there is a 
wide range of advice already available, 
such as that provided by UKCIP, there 
are currently no standard reporting 
approaches to follow. 

The Climate Change Bill therefore 
requires the Government to produce 
guidance for such authorities to use. 

This guidance will ensure that any 
adaptation reports requested under 
the power in the Bill are of a consistent 
quality, and will give information on the 
different types of approach that might be 
applicable to different organisations. It 
will be publicly available, and so could be 

used as a reference by any organisation to 
help them in their process of considering 
the risks to their operations posed by 
climate change. The ACC Programme will 
produce this guidance, working closely 
with organisations already developing 
adaptation approaches, including the 
local authorities that are working on the 
Climate Change Indicator. There will be 
a full public consultation on the draft 
guidance in the summer of 2009 in 
order to publish a final version by the 
end of that year. 

c) Action at the regional 
and local level 
The impacts of climate change will vary, 
even within a relatively local area, and 
action will need to taken at the most 
appropriate level. This will often be 
regional and local, rather than national. 
In addition many of the actions that 
need to be taken early but have a 
long-term impact are delivered at local 
and regional level. These include spatial 

planning and investments in schools, 
houses, hospitals and roads, and the 
provision of a wide range of essential 
public services. 

Government Offices in the Regions 
Government Offices (GOs) are vital to 
ensuring Government objectives are 
delivered at the regional and local level. 

GOs have built up a network of 
adaptation leads in each region, whose 
aim is to build adaptation knowledge 
and capacity within their organisation, 
and also to co-ordinate and join up 
work at the regional level. The GOs have 
led the negotiation on the new local 
government performance indicators 
including the new indicator on 
adaptation (further information about 
the indicator is provided on page 40). 
GOs will continue to work with other 
partners at the regional level to improve 
adaptive capacity, in particular UKCIP 
and Nottingham Declaration Partners.

The Regional Development 
Agencies (RDAs) 
The RDAs have committed teams in 
place which have been working for 
some time, with partners within the 
English Regions, to address the issues 
surrounding climate change including 
adaptation. The RDAs are likely to 
become even more important in the 
drive to adapt effectively and efficiently 
subject to the results of recent 
consultation on the review of sub­
regional economic development and 
regeneration, which proposed changes 
to the organisation and responsibilities 
of regional bodies so that they are 
better positioned to support growth in 
regional economic performance.  The 
review recommended the creation 
of a new regional strategy to build 
on and replace the existing regional 
economic and spatial strategies, which 
could potentially also integrate regional 
sustainable development frameworks 
and better support adaptation planning. 

The RDAs will be responsible for 
producing the strategy on behalf of 
the region and we will work with them 
to ensure they have the skills and the 
evidence they need to build resilience 
and flexibility into the plans, and to 
grasp the economic opportunities of 
adaptation in each region. 

The Programme will also work with 
the RDAs and other partners to ensure 
information about climate change 
impacts is readily accessible to business 
advisory bodies through, for example, 
Business Link, and to build business 
capacity to take action. 

London 
In the Greater London Authority 
Act 2007, Government has given 
the Mayor of London a new duty in 
tackling climate change. This includes 
committing the Mayor to prepare and 
publish a statutory “Adaptation to 
Climate Change for London Strategy” 

(covering the Mayor’s assessment of 
the consequences of climate change 
for Greater London and his proposals 
and policies for adaptation) as well 
as placing a duty on the Mayor and 
London Assembly to have regard to 
climate change in preparing other 
statutory Mayoral strategies. 

Regional Climate Change 
Partnerships (RCCPs) 
Each UK Region has an independent 
Climate Change Partnership, which 
investigates, advises and informs on the 
impacts of climate change for regional 
economic, social and environmental well­
being. The partnerships are made up of 
local stakeholders ranging from

local charities. They work very closely 
with UKCIP and are supported by Defra. 
They investigate the local effects of the 
changes that climate change will bring 
and advise on the types of responses 
that are needed. As the partnerships 
reflect their local circumstances they 
work on both aspects of climate change 
– adaptation and mitigation. 

The partnerships share experiences 
across the regions and with the 
partnerships in Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland, and work together 
to develop joint projects, like the 
“Checklist for Development” produced 
by the East of England, London and the 
South East. Links to their regions can 
be found on the Adapting to Climate 
Change website and the UKCIP website. 

The ACC Programme will work with 
the RCCPs, to help them build on their 
success. The Programme has already 
provided a cash boost of £450,000 in 

2008-09, and a further two year funding 
commitment covering 2009-2011. 

Local Government 
Local authorities are at the front line 
in planning for the impacts of climate 
change and  picking up the pieces when 
the weather creates problems for local 
communities. There are some great 
examples of local authorities leading 
best practice in adapting to climate 
change, but it is an emerging issue for 
many others. 

The introduction of a new performance 
indicator on adaptation in the core Local 
Government Performance Framework 
(more details on page 40) is helping 
to raise the profile of adaptation. The 
ACC Programme, in partnership with 
Government Offices, the Nottingham 
Declaration partnership, the Environment 
Agency, UKCIP and others, is putting 
in place a programme of support for 
local authorities and their partners in 
Local Strategic Partnerships to help

Case Study: Project Vale Street 
The effects of climate change mean that there is a growing demand for 
sustainable housing. London & Quadrant Housing Trust (L&Q) has announced 
that its Vale Street development will be built to Level 4 of the Code for 
Sustainable Homes. 

Vale Street is an urban residential scheme that: 
• has selected building materials and used construction methods that mean 

that the homes will retain warmth in the winter yet remain cool in the 
summer months; 

• aims to reduce the energy demand of homes through mechanical heat 
recovery and super insulating the building fabric; 

• used green roofs, which benefit biodiversity and keep buildings cooler; 
• orientated the houses and apartments towards the open aspects of the 

site, reflecting the need to maintain some solar shading, whilst making 
use of passive solar heating. 

The Nottingham Declaration is a 
voluntary pledge made by local 
authorities to address the issues of 
climate change. It represents a high-
level, broad statement of commitment 
that any council can make to its own 
community. The declaration was 
originally launched in October 2000 at 
a conference in Nottingham with 200 
leaders, chief executives and senior 
managers of UK local government. The 
Nottingham Declaration Partnership 
have recently re-launched the

Your Home in a Changing Climate 
In February 2008, the Three Regions Climate Change Group, comprising 
the partnerships of the East, South East and London published a jointly 
commissioned report: Your Home in a Changing Climate. The report 
outlines that by adapting our existing homes now, we can help address the 
impacts of present and future flooding, water shortages and overheating. 
It concludes that it is possible and cost effective to increase the resilience of 
the existing housing stock and that small changes can have a big impact on 
both adapting and reducing carbon emissions, particularly when it comes to 
saving water and tackling overheating. The Group is currently working on the 
next phase of this work which will include the possibility of incentivisation for 
retrofitting in London, working with local authorities to pilot retrofitting in 
social housing, and influencing national housing policy.

the Programme will work with other 
Government Departments, including 
Communities and Local Government

of work such as investment in public 
infrastructure and buildings planning and

This existing indicator is a useful 
benchmark of success. However, there 
are clearly many other areas of life 
where we need to adapt, and the ACC 
Programme will look to develop a suite 
of national indicators to help measure 
progress. 

We will need indicators of both process 
(for example on raising awareness 
and embedding adaptation into 
planning processes) and outcome-
focused measurements. In many cases, 
it may be possible to use existing 
measurements. This is a new area of 
work and one where further research 
and thinking is needed. The Programme 
will therefore come forward by Spring 
2009 with proposals for a new basket 
of performance measures for adapting 
to climate change. These will cover 
the need to raise awareness, to build 
capacity in the public, private and 
third sectors, and changes in policy 
and practice to deliver real world 

outcomes. The Programme will engage 
stakeholders in their development, 
including through the Adapting to 
Climate Change website. 

b) Ensuring delivery across the 
public sector and utilities 

The Local Government 
Performance Framework 
For the first time this year Government 
has set out an indicator for all English 
local authorities on embedding 
adaptation in the full range of their 
work. This is one of the National 
Indicators for local authorities and Local 
Strategic Partnerships, which 
is the single route through which 
central government sets priorities for 
local government. 

The indicator (NI 188) is based on the 
process for embedding adaptation into 
work on the authorities’ existing key 
objectives, ensuring they are not put 

off course by climate change, and 
ensuring the planning processes 
and evidence are based on an 
understanding of a changing climate. 
The specific actions needed will depend 
on the priorities and characteristics of 
a particular local authority. All local 
authorities will need to report on their 
progression through different levels 
of the indicator and will be assessed 
on this by the Audit Commission, the 
auditor for local government. 

In addition, Local Strategic Partnerships, 
which bring together local authorities 
with other local public, private and 
third sector partners, agree Local 
Area Agreements (LAAs) with central 
government on around �5 targets based 
on the national indicators which if they 
are achieved open up extra central 
government funding for them. Around 
one third of the 150 LAAs in England 
have included the new adaptation 
indicator, or have this as a local target. 


40 

The Government’s new 
Reporting Power 
There are a number of legal or 
management levers already in place 
across the public sector and for the 
privatised utilities, such as water and 
energy suppliers, which are already, 
or could be, used to ensure that these 
organisations are addressing the risks of 
climate change. However, most of them 
were put in place without reference to 
evidence on how a changing climate 
would affect these organisations. Yet 
the capacity of these organisations to 
adapt to a new environment is vital 
in minimising the potential negative 
impacts of climate change in England. 
So the Climate Change Bill introduces a 
power for the Secretary of State to ask 
any of these bodies to produce a report 
on how they have assessed and are 
addressing the risks from climate change 
to the delivery of their objectives. These 
reports will be published and will shine 
a spotlight on poor performance and 

Case Study – The Thames Estuary 
2100 Project 
Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) is an Environment Agency project to develop 
a tidal flood risk management plan for the Thames estuary through to the 
end of the century. Using the latest climate change scenarios and models, and 
taking account of future sea level rise, the final plan will recommend what flood 
risk management measures will be required in the estuary, where they will be 
needed, and when over the coming century. The final plan will also be flexible 
to ensure that it can be adaptable to sea levels rising faster, or storm surges 
becoming more intense, than anticipated. 

Preliminary findings show that the Thames Barrier, with some adaptation, 
will continue to provide protection through to the end of the century. 
However, by 2050 we may need to improve many of the flood defence 
walls and embankments, and create new inter tidal habitats to offset 
the impact of rising sea levels before 20�0.

a) Embedding adaptation into 
Government processes and systems. 
The Green Book 
The Treasury Green Book is the central 
point across Government for guidance 
on the economic assessment of spending 
and investment. Under the auspices of 
HM Treasury, sponsored jointly with the 
ACC Programme, a cross-Government 
working group is examining whether 
additional Green Book guidance is 
required to enable climate change 
adaptation to be built properly into 
the decision making process for future 
spending and investment proposals. 

Procurement 
The Programme will work with the 
Office of Government Commerce to 
ensure that public sector procurement 
guidance helps organisations to 
understand how climate change may 
affect them and what actions they can 
take to reduce risks and maximise value 
for money. 

Policy assessment 
Impact Assessments are used across 
Government as part of the policy-
making process. They help policy-makers 
think through the consequences of 
Government interventions, considering 
the positive and negative effects. The 
ACC Programme will work with the 
Better Regulation Executive to see how 
Impact Assessment Toolkits need to be 
amended to ensure that the effects of 
climate change are considered among 
the impacts that are being assessed. 

Sustainable Development 
Action Planning 
All central Government Departments 
and their Executive Agencies produce 
Sustainable Development Action Plans 
(SDAPs) and update them regularly. The 
plans are scrutinised by the Sustainable 
Development Commission (SDC). 
Departments are required to report on 
progress made in their SDAPs through, 
for example, their Departmental Annual 
Reports. The ACC Programme will work 

with the SDC to embed adapting to 
climate change in this process. 

Making the Government 
estate resilient 
As with all organisations, the 
Government needs to ensure that 
its built assets are resilient to climate 
change. The Government owns and 
occupies thousands of buildings, 
and the ACC Programme will be 
investigating the work that will need 
to be done to consider how resilient the 
Government estate is, and what might 
be done to increase that resilience. 

b) Embedding adaptation into key 
Government Programmes 
A major challenge for all Government 
Departments and Agencies, as with any 
other organisation in the public and 
private sector, is to review their policies 
and operations in the light of the risks 
of climate change, and consider the 
options for adaptive action. This process 
will be helped by the publication of the

The activity described here and on the 
website is only a sample of the range 
of work involved in adapting to climate 
change and reflects the start of a long-
term process. We recognise we have 
a long way to go until all Government 
Programmes routinely consider climate 
change risks at policy and delivery 
stages and are planned accordingly. 
That is why we have established a cross-
Government Programme approach to 
ensure this happens on a systematic 
and consistent basis. We will publish 
a report on the website in a year’s 
time on progress on the work of 
the Programme. 

Case Study: The Highways Agency 
The Highways Agency has developed a climate change adaptation strategy to 
equip its staff with the knowledge and tools to assess risks to the delivery of 
their business and develop appropriate management actions. 

It has also introduced new proprietary road surface course materials based 
primarily on materials introduced from France (asphaltic concrete type mixtures 
generally with polymer modified binder) and Germany (stone mastic asphalt type 
mixtures generally with cellulose fibres) in the early 1990s. These materials are 
much more resistant to permanent deformation in hot weather conditions than 
previously used hot rolled asphalt materials. They are also cheaper and quicker 
to lay and have a negative textured surface which has the additional benefit 
of reduced noise and surface water spray. Developments in high modulus 
binder course and base materials in France are now included in the Highways 
Agency pavement designs. These materials utilise very stiff, high binder content, 
deformation resistant mixtures and can allow thinner construction layers 
compared with conventional mixtures. 

The Agency has also introduced improved drainage standards for new works 
and renewals to allow for increases in rainfall intensity of 20%.

working in Partnership 


 

The Programme will work 
to engage stakeholders 
and the general public 
in taking decisions 
and taking action 
on adaptation. 

Our starting point for this process will 
be a new Partnership Board. This Board 
will bring together key stakeholders 
from the public, private and third 
sectors, representing national, regional 
and local delivery partners, to both 
advise Government on the development 
of the Programme and be active 
participants in it. The Board will also 
lead on developing approaches to wider 
stakeholder engagement in adaptation. 

We are committed to working 
collaboratively and transparently with 
stakeholders, since this will produce 
better policy outcomes and delivery 
of actions. The Partnership Board 


46 

will be an important element of this 
approach. We will also use other 
networks to engage different sectors, 
for example by helping local bodies 
engage the public in decisions which 
affect their communities, and by 
working with business on how to bring 
about necessary changes in the least 
burdensome way. We will also explore 
how the Adapting to Climate Change 
website can be used to engage people 
in debate and to share best practice. 
Adaptation is inevitably a process of 
learning by experience, and we want 
to share the lessons from each other’s 
mistakes and successes. 

A number of projects undertaken as 
part of the Programme will be delivered 
with the involvement of stakeholders, 
including the third sector and 
businesses. 

The third sector 
Third sector organisations are already 
providing valuable public services such 
as advice and support to victims of 
flooding, care for the elderly and infirm 
who often struggle to cope with extreme 
weather, and helping to protect our 
natural environment. The Government 
will work with the wide range of 
third sector organisations on climate 
change adaptation. 

Business 
Climatic change will present both 
opportunities and risks for businesses 
in different sectors, not just the obvious 
ones such as agriculture, the built 
environment and tourism. Exposure 
to impacts will vary by sector and 
the location in which the business 
operates. Businesses and sectors may 
be particularly vulnerable if they are 
currently affected by the weather, make 
long term investment decisions, have 
global markets and suppliers, or lack 
the resources and skills to develop

A Study on the impacts 
on the workforce 
The Trade Union Congress (TUC) has recently 
commissioned AEA, an environmental 
consultancy, to conduct a study into the 
employment implications of adaptation in 
the UK. So far the research suggests that 
there will be a number of issues for workers 
and employers, including the skills needed 
for adaptation, health and safety in the 
workplace, and the potentially inequitable 
impacts of some adaptation measures. Initial 
findings suggest that a number of sectors 
are likely to be particularly affected, including 
energy, utilities, agriculture, tourism, health, 
construction, fire and emergency services, 
government (local and national), transport, 
finance and insurance. The study has involved 
an online survey of public sector organisations, 
telephone interviews with a number of 
FTSE 100 companies, and a workshop with 
Trade Union representatives. Results and 
policy recommendations from the project 
will be published in the form of a new TUC 
Touchstone pamphlet towards the end of the 
year, accessible through www.tuc.org.uk.

adaptive capacity and capability. While 
the direct impacts of climate change 
may be obvious (for example, floods, 
droughts, higher temperatures), the 
indirect impacts may not be. Impacts 
are likely to be felt in all areas of a 
business but in particular in logistics, 
finance, premises, people, markets, 
processes and management. The 
impacts of climate change can 
also be significant in terms of new 
opportunities emerging for businesses 
if they are quick to respond, particularly 
in comparison to their national and 
international competitors. Examples 
of opportunities include specialist 
roles such as water management, 
retrofitting homes to resist hotter and 
wetter weather or expanding markets 
in financial products such as weather 
derivatives. The Government will work 
with businesses to help them manage 
risks and maximise opportunities, in 
particular by providing information, 
supporting innovation and ensuring that 
the workforce is appropriately skilled. 

of help and advice on adaptation. Over 
time, we hope to develop interactive 
tools to help people engage with the 
work of the Programme.

Getting involved 
There will be opportunities to be 
involved in the work of the Programme, 
for example, by responding to our 
consultations on the Climate Change 
Risk Assessment, the Statutory 
Guidance, and the use of the Secretary 
of State’s Reporting Power. 

The Adapting to Climate Change 
website will provide up-to-date 
information about the Government’s 
Programme and highlight opportunities 
for engagement. It also aims to provide 
an adaptation “hub” for individuals and 
organisations to go to for information 
on adaptation. There will be links to 
other available information and sources 




conclusion: 
looking to the future 


50 

The Climate Change Bill, 
currently passing through 
Parliament, commits the 
Government to preparing 
a statutory National 
Adaptation Programme. 
This statutory Programme, 
likely to be in place in 
2012, will build on and 
incorporate the work of 
the cross-Government 
Adapting to Climate Change 
Programme 2008–2011, 
as summarised in this 
document. 

The statutory Programme will be 
reviewed and updated on a five year 
rolling basis in response to updated 
risk assessments and in the light of 
progress. Each update will cover progress 
in implementing the Programme, and 
interim reports will be presented to 
Parliament. 

The decision to give the Programme 
a formal, legal basis demonstrates 
the Government’s commitment to 
ensuring that the UK is prepared to 
adapt to the impacts of climate change. 
The arrangements for continuous 
review and updating show that the 
Government recognises that there is 
not a single point at which we will be 
able to say “we have adapted”. Our 
understanding of how the climate is 

changing, and how it will impact upon 
us will develop. Our response to the 
changing climate will be affected by a 
range of other developments, such as 
population growth, the economy and 
the development of new technology. 

This document sets out the start of a 
journey in understanding the challenge 
that lies ahead. It has outlined the 
framework for action, which will be 
built on over time. The Adapting to 
Climate Change website will be an 
evolving source of information for all. 

The Government will work with 
stakeholders across society in 
addressing what is one of the most 
significant and potentially far-reaching 
challenges that our country faces.
