 Executive summary 3

Executive summary

In December 2015, the UK joined 195 countries in signing an historic global deal to tackle 
climate change. The Paris Agreement commits the international community to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid some of the most severe impacts of climate 
change. Despite this, we know that some changes to the climate are already inescapable 
due to past emissions of greenhouse gases. These changes present challenges and 
opportunities to all aspects of our society, and we must act on these if we are to achieve 
our ambitions of creating a stronger, more resilient economy and a natural environment 
that benefits people and can provide the vital resources and services we need.

Climate change is not only a challenge of the future. We are already observing changes 
in the UK climate, with average temperatures having risen by around 1ºC over the last 
century. We are seeing a trend towards warmer winters and hotter summers, sea levels 
around our coast are rising by around 3mm a year and there is emerging evidence of 
changing rainfall patterns. The heavy rainfall and flooding over the winter of 2015/16 – 
although they cannot yet be attributed to climate change – illustrate the costs and 
disruption that can be caused by extreme weather. The ongoing development of the 
Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan is one example of how we are building climate 
adaptation into our plans and investments to ensure that we are resilient for the future.

The Climate Change Act 2008 is an important piece of UK legislation that, on a five-yearly 
cycle, requires the Government to compile an assessment of the risks for the UK arising 
from climate change, and then to develop an adaptation programme to address those 
risks and deliver resilience to climate change on the ground. The Act established the 
Committee on Climate Change as an independent statutory body to advise the UK and 
Devolved Governments on setting and meeting carbon budgets and preparing for climate 
change. It also established the Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate 
Change specifically to provide advice on climate change risks and opportunities and to 
report regularly on UK progress on adaptation.

In accordance with the requirements of the Act, we present here the Government’s 
second assessment of the risks and opportunities for the UK of the current and predicted 
impact of climate change, which follows on from the first report published in 2012. It draws 
primarily on an independent Evidence Report commissioned from the Adaptation 
Sub-Committee by the UK and the Devolved Governments.1 The Synthesis Report of the 
Evidence Report sets out six urgent priorities for action over the next five years. In general, 
the Government endorses the conclusions of the Adaptation Sub-Committee, with the 
exception of some of those on food security.

4 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017

We are very grateful to all of those who contributed so generously of their time and 
expertise to the production of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence 
Report. Hundreds of leading scientists participated as authors and reviewers, drawing on 
a wealth of research from the UK’s world-leading academic institutes as well as a range of 
other expert sources. Consistent with our commitment to open data, all the underpinning 
evidence has been published by the Committee on Climate Change, to ensure that 
government, businesses and other stakeholders have the information they need to 
take action.

Our statutory commitments under the Climate Change Act 2008 are unaffected by the 
decision to leave the EU. Leaving the EU offers a unique opportunity to shape our 
environment and economy for the benefit of all and we will do this in a way that provides 
as much support as possible to the environment’s natural resilience and adaptability, as 
well as recognising its potential role in letting us make changes to our infrastructure and 
ways of working to cope with the impacts of climate change.




 1. Introduction 5

1. Introduction

This report fulfils the requirement of the Climate Change Act 2008 for the Government to 
lay before Parliament a five-yearly assessment of the risks for the UK of the current and 
predicted impacts of climate change.

The purpose of this second UK Climate Change Risk Assessment report to Parliament is 
to outline the UK and Devolved Governments’ views on the key climate change risks and 
opportunities that the UK faces today. These views have been informed primarily by an 
independent assessment of the available evidence on climate risks and opportunities, 
which was commissioned by the UK and Devolved Governments from the Adaptation 
Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change. The Adaptation Sub-Committee’s 
UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report sets out six priority areas 
needing urgent further action over the next five years. The next two sections of this report 
provide the UK and Devolved Governments’ views on each of those six urgent priority 
areas. Further action to address these risks will be considered as we develop the next 
National Adaptation Programme, covering England and non-devolved matters, and due 
to be published in 2018. The Devolved Governments each have their own policy and 
implementation framework and these are set out in Section 3 along with their views on the 
specific risks that affect them.

In general, the UK Government and the Devolved Governments endorse the conclusions 
of the Evidence Report prepared by the Adaptation Sub-Committee, with the exception of 
some of the conclusions on food security.

1.1 Legislative framework on climate change

The Climate Change Act 2008 provides a legally binding framework to cut UK 
greenhouse gas emissions and a framework for building the UK’s ability to adapt to the 
changing climate.

In terms of adaptation, the Act requires:

• A UK-wide assessment of the risks and opportunities for the UK arising from climate 
change. This must take place every five years; the first assessment (UK Climate 
Change Risk Assessment: Government Report) was published in January 2012.

• A programme for adaptation to climate change to address the identified risks so as 
to deliver resilience to climate change on the ground. This must be put in place and 
reviewed every five years, and must set out the UK Government’s objectives, 
proposals and policies for responding to the risks identified in the Risk Assessment. 
The first National Adaptation Programme: Making the country resilient to a changing 




6 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017

climate, covering England and devolved matters, was published in 2013 and many of 
the actions are ongoing.

• Adaptation Reporting Powers (not applicable in Northern Ireland) which enable the 
Secretary of State to direct ‘reporting authorities’ to prepare climate change 
adaptation reports. A second round of reporting has taken place, with around 
80 organisations submitting voluntary reports during 2016.

The Climate Change Act 2008 also established the Adaptation Sub-Committee of the 
Committee on Climate Change. Its role is to provide independent advice on the 
preparation of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment, to report to Parliament on the 
UK Government’s progress in the implementation of the National Adaptation Programme 
and to provide advice to the Devolved Governments, as required.

1.2 The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report

To underpin both the first and second UK Climate Change Risk Assessments, the 
Government commissioned independent expert studies of the available evidence.

The Evidence Report underpinning the Government’s first report in 2012 was produced 
by a consortium funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(Defra) and the Devolved Governments. It provided a benchmark assessment of the risks 
and opportunities of climate change to the UK.

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report was commissioned from 
the Adaptation Sub-Committee, which was asked to address the following question:

‘Based on the latest understanding of current, and future, climate risks/opportunities, 
vulnerability and adaptation, what should the priorities be for the next UK National 
Adaptation Programme and adaptation programmes of the devolved administrations?’

In order to assess climate risks in a consistent way, and to facilitate action being focused 
on the most pressing risks, the Adaptation Sub-Committee took a three-step approach to 
assess the urgency of additional action for each climate risk and opportunity:

• considering the magnitude of the risk now and in the future
• taking into account policies and adaptation plans already in place to manage the risks
• considering the potential benefits of further action.

Figure 1 sets out the four ‘urgency categories’ used to assess each of the 56 individual 
climate risks and opportunities considered by the Adaptation Sub-Committee. A full 
description of the method for assigning urgency scores can be found in Chapter 2 of the 
Evidence Report.

MORE 
ACTION 
NEEDED

New, stronger or di�erent government policies or implementation 
activities – over and above those already planned – are needed in the 
next �ve years to reduce long-term vulnerability to climate change.

RESEARCH 
PRIORITY 

Research is needed to �ll signi�cant evidence gaps or reduce the 
uncertainty in the current level of understanding in order to assess 
the need for additional action.

SUSTAIN 
CURRENT 
ACTION

Current or planned levels of activity are appropriate, but continued 
implementation of these policies or plans is needed to ensure that 
the risk continues to be managed in the future. This includes any 
existing plans to increase or change the current level of activity.

WATCHING 
BRIEF

The evidence in these areas should be kept under review, with 
long-term monitoring of risk levels and adaptation activity so that 
further action can be taken if necessary.

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report also goes further than 
the first in considering international climate risks that could have consequences for the 
UK, as well as the interdependencies between the various climate risks.

The Adaptation Sub-Committee’s full Evidence Report comprises an overarching 
Synthesis Report, which summarises the conclusions of eight technical chapters and 
highlights six groups of priority risks where additional action is recommended in the next 
five years (Figure 2). The six priority risk areas encompass most of the individual risks that 
are identified as needing ‘more action’ in the underpinning technical chapters. The full list 
of risks and their assigned urgency scorings is provided in Figure 3.

policies and plans across the UK are likely to reduce risks.

2. The UK Government’s assessment of priority 
risks and opportunities

The Government endorses the six priority areas identified by the Adaptation 
Sub-Committee in the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report. 
We agree with the urgency scores that have been assigned to each of the areas except 
for some elements of the area relating to food production. In this section, we provide a 
summary of each risk area and the Government’s general approach. Detailed responses 
and actions will form the subject of the next National Adaptation Programme, due to be 
published in 2018.

Adapting to climate change is a government-wide issue with different departments leading 
on different risks. Defra works across government and with other partners to fulfil the 
requirements of the Climate Change Act 2008. Defra also leads on providing future UK 
Climate Projections, an important resource used widely by government, business, local 
government, civil society and communities to understand how the climate may change 
over the rest of the century. Defra has commissioned the Met Office Hadley Centre 
to produce an updated set of UK Climate Projections (UKCP18) in 2018 to ensure 
that organisations continue to have access to the latest science to inform their 
adaptation planning.

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report highlights that climate 
risks will affect people differently, depending on their social, economic and cultural 
environment. Low-income households are particularly susceptible to climate change 
impacts, as these impacts disproportionally affect their resources. These groups also 
have lower capacity and resources to adapt. Evaluation of climate risks and actions must 
consider these distributional effects.

The Green Book: Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government2 was prepared by 
HM Treasury to promote effective government investment and ensure it aligns with 
government priorities and the expectations of the public. The guidance applies to all 
government departments and sets out how the risks of climate change should be 
considered in options appraisals whenever relevant, particularly for long-term planning 
and infrastructure projects, regulatory and planning frameworks, contingency planning 
and long-term policy frameworks. The guidance also states that an assessment should 
take into account social and distributional impacts where they are likely to be significant 
for particular groups in society. The Green Book is currently being updated, with a revised 
edition due for publication in 2017.

Below we address the six priority risk areas in turn.

 2. The UK Government’s assessment of priority risks and opportunities 11

2.1 Flooding and coastal change risks to communities, businesses and 
infrastructure (‘more action needed’)

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report presents compelling 
evidence that climate change may lead to increases in heavy rainfall and significantly 
increased risks from fluvial and surface flooding by mid-century. Rising sea levels may 
further increase the risk of flooding and erosion along our coastline. The Evidence Report 
recommends more ambitious approaches to adaptation, working with communities, 
businesses and other partners to meet this challenge by:

• ensuring there are long-term strategies in place to address projected risks to people, 
communities and buildings

• delivering more natural flood management and developing a more integrated 
approach in high-risk catchments, especially where there are likely to be co-benefits 
such as carbon storage, water quality and biodiversity benefits.

The Government supports these recommendations. Managing flood risk is already a key 
priority for the Government, and the report’s recommendations are broadly consistent 
with our policies to intervene and invest effectively to manage flood risk. Our strategies are 
most effective when government, communities, local authorities and the private sector 
work together to ensure that we have a shared understanding of future risks and who is 
best placed to manage them. Together we need to make use of the full suite of measures 
and target them as effectively as we can, to make it less likely that flooding will occur and 
to reduce the impact when it does.

Our flood risk investment programme will drive down the overall risk of flooding and 
coastal erosion to ensure that we will better protect over 300,000 homes from flooding by 
2021. These investments are based on a well-developed national flood risk assessment 
and long-term investment scenario modelling developed by the Environment Agency, 
which already factors in climate change predictions and continually evolves to take 
account of new climate change evidence and risks. The long-term investment scenario 
modelling considers differing investment scenarios in the face of pressures such as 
climate change and asset deterioration and takes into account total levels of investment, 
not just government investment. The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence 
Report recognises that current levels of investment are consistent with an optimal 
investment strategy.

The National Flood Resilience Review3 was published in September 2016 and sets out 
actions to improve our readiness for flooding in the short term, to reduce the impacts and 
the consequent costs and disruption to communities, businesses and our economy. This 
includes working with infrastructure operators to improve the resilience of locally important 
assets at risk of flooding. The review will also inform our consideration of long-term 
investment needs and funding options.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-resilience-review




12 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017

We believe the installation of property-level resilience measures (those that prevent flood 
water entering a property or that speed the recovery process if it does) can play an 
important role in making people and their property less vulnerable to the physical and 
mental impacts of flooding. In September 2016, we published Peter Bonfield’s Property 
Flood Resilience Action Plan4 which was developed in collaboration with the commercial 
sector with Government support. The Action Plan explores barriers to the use of flood 
resilience measures and identifies how, collectively, business and government can 
facilitate better uptake of such measures for residential and commercial properties at 
high flood risk.

We engage with and support local authorities in their responsibilities for managing local 
flood risk. National planning policy on the provision of sustainable drainage systems in 
developments has been strengthened. The Housing and Planning Act 2016 introduces a 
new requirement for the Secretary of State to carry out a review of planning legislation 
and planning policies for sustainable drainage in relation to the development of land 
in England.

Incorporating natural flood management measures is key to our approach and we 
encourage such schemes as part of large capital projects. Natural flood management 
demonstration projects, including at Pickering in Yorkshire and Holnicote in Somerset, 
have demonstrated that these types of measures can be effective in helping to manage 
flood risk at a catchment scale, slowing the flow of water and reducing local impacts when 
carefully incorporated into a wider suite of catchment measures. In November 2016, we 
announced £15 million specifically for natural flood management projects in England, 
which will build the evidence base further.

Increasingly, we are seeking to empower and enable local communities to understand 
their risks and to develop catchment-based strategies. These integrate traditional, 
innovative and natural flood management measures to provide multiple benefits. 
An example of a local partnership approach is the Cumbria Flood Partnership. These 
types of local partnerships will be further strengthened in the context of the 25 Year 
Environment Plan.

Looking ahead, we will continue to develop our longer-term strategies on investment, 
providing local communities with the framework and tools they need to manage flood 
risks effectively.

2.2 Risks to health, well-being and productivity from high temperatures 
(‘more action needed’)

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report shows that warming UK 
temperatures, combined with demographic change, may lead to an increased risk of 
overheating. It projects that the number of heat-related deaths in the UK could more than

double by the 2050s from a current baseline of around 2,000 per year. The Evidence 
Report states that urgent action is needed in the next five years across a range of policy 
areas to address overheating in homes and public buildings and to reduce the impacts of 
the urban heat island effect through urban design and planning. Research is 
recommended into the impacts of overheating on employee productivity.

Research is also recommended into the influence of climate change on ground-level 
ozone and other outdoor air pollutants (especially particulates), and how climate, 
temperature and other factors (eg individual behaviour) affect indoor air quality.

The Evidence Report also notes some potential opportunities associated with higher 
temperatures. Outdoor activities may become more attractive, with perhaps an increase 
in active transport, such as cycling, and walking leading to benefits for health and 
well-being, as well as climate change mitigation from reductions in car use. However, 
these benefits need to be set against the potential for greater exposure to the risks from 
sunlight, ultraviolet radiation and air pollution. Warmer winters could also lead to fewer 
cold-related deaths, which currently account for a greater number of excess deaths than 
periods of very hot weather.

The Government recognises the importance of reducing the risks and impacts of 
overheating. Overheating is a complex issue that cuts across a number of policy areas, 
including health, planning, transport, energy and environment. Responsibility for different 
aspects of planning, commissioning and funding improvements is shared across a range 
of organisations. Government departments and public and private entities are working 
together to deliver improvements in these areas.

A number of different policies and plans will affect how risks to health, well-being and high 
temperatures can be managed in future. For example, Public Health England publishes 
the Heatwave Plan for England to manage risks to public health. This document is 
recognised in the Evidence Report as a key component of emergency planning that 
provides advice for professionals, organisations and individuals to enable them to plan for 
and respond to hot weather. An independent evaluation of the Heatwave Plan is under 
way. In May 2016, Public Health England also published a new poster and leaflet to 
support the public to stay safe in hot weather, and a checklist for identifying and 
managing high indoor temperatures in homes. A checklist specifically for care home staff 
is under development.

Looking forward, we will consider where additional policy interventions are necessary to 
address overheating risks as part of the National Adaptation Programme. For example, 
the Government is commissioning research into how overheating risks can be identified 
and mitigated. In the first instance, this will focus on new housing developments in 
England, building on work undertaken by the former Zero Carbon Hub. We will also 
explore whether there are better methods for understanding overheating risks in hospitals.




14 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017

2.3 Risks of shortages in the public water supply, and for agriculture, 
energy generation and industry, with impacts on freshwater ecology 
(‘more action needed’)

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report sets out how climate 
change combined with population growth may put greater pressure on water availability. 
By the 2050s, many catchments across the UK will need to manage water deficits and 
competing demands for water for public supply, industry, agriculture and the environment. 
The Evidence Report recognises that the policy framework for managing these long-term 
risks exists. It recommends continued action in the next five years that is flexible enough 
to take account of the high degree of uncertainty about future projections of seasonal 
rainfall and therefore the frequency and intensity of water shortages and drought.

The Government is committed to more action on these risks and recently published 
Creating a great place for living: Enabling resilience in the water sector,5 a roadmap setting 
out how we will enhance our policy framework to secure the long-term resilience of the 
water sector. The roadmap covers a wide range of areas, including the long-term 
challenge to the public water supply and other water users from the greater extremes in 
weather that are expected.

We have also issued guidance to water companies that their next round of water resource 
management plans should take a long-term, strategic approach to protecting and 
enhancing resilient water supplies. Water companies are required to embed climate 
change impacts as well as population and economic growth in their long-term plans, so 
as to ensure that they are fully able to meet future water demand/supply balances. As a 
result, there is already a well-recognised need for future investment in both demand-side 
and supply-side measures to mitigate the risks from climate change. In turn, these actions 
will help create a freshwater environment capable of supporting the biodiversity it contains 
and the ecosystem services it provides.

We are aware that the current water abstraction system (set up in the 1960s) is not flexible 
or modern enough to respond to pressures on the environment, farm and other business 
requirements, and the needs of our public water supply. We are therefore committed to 
reform the system by the early 2020s to create a better, fairer, more modern and flexible 
approach that will support business resilience, investment and growth, and manage the 
pressures of a growing population and climate change.

Reform includes many elements that will lead to better protection of the environment and 
that will be adaptive over time. For example:

• we will ensure that all abstractors are proportionately controlled at low flows to protect 
the environment, while recognising essential water users

• all abstraction conditions on permits will be reviewable when there is evidence of 
environmental risk being caused by abstraction.

2.4 Risks to natural capital, including terrestrial, coastal, marine and 
freshwater ecosystems, soils and biodiversity (‘more action needed’)

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report identifies significant 
threats to our natural capital and the goods and services it provides, from timber, food 
and clean water to pollination, carbon storage and the cultural benefits of landscapes 
and wildlife. The Evidence Report shows that direct impacts on the distribution of UK 
biodiversity and the composition of terrestrial, coastal, marine and freshwater ecosystems 
are already being observed. There is clear evidence of northwards shifts in species 
distributions and the timing of seasonal events due to climate change.

The Evidence Report highlights important links between climate change impacts on 
natural capital and the other risk areas. For example, the natural environment plays an 
integral role in the quality and availability of our water and on the magnitude of flood 
events. It provides the backdrop to the movement of pests and diseases, and can play 
a role in addressing overheating through urban trees and green spaces.

The report also identifies potential opportunities for agriculture and forestry in the form of 
extended growing seasons, increased productivity and new crop varieties that would have 
potential benefits for domestic food production. In order for these opportunities to be 
realised, however, action is needed to manage the negative impacts from reduced soil 
quality and water availability and the increase in flooding and pests and diseases.

The Evidence Report concludes that, while good progress is being made, strengthened 
action is needed over the next five years to reduce existing pressures on the environment. 
More flexible and integrated approaches to managing natural capital need to be adopted 
and priority research undertaken into the changing suitability of land for different uses and 
the climate risks to marine ecosystems.

The Government supports the Evidence Report’s conclusions. Various policies are 
already in place to address climate risks to natural capital. For example, increased efforts 
to restore the hydrology of wetland habitats are under way as part of Countryside 
Stewardship, and the Forestry Commission is working to protect, improve and expand 
woodlands on the Public Forest Estate. We also note potential areas for improvement, for 
example better use of policy levers such as the successor to the EU Common 
Agricultural Policy.

The Government recognises that reducing other pressures is a priority for increasing the 
resilience of our natural capital to climate change. We have already made good progress 
in restoring Sites of Special Scientific Interest to ‘favourable’ or ‘recovering’ condition, in 
making land available for the creation of priority habitat and in establishing Marine 
Protected Areas. Alongside reducing pressures, we also recognise the other clear 
message of the report – that we need to accommodate change, such as through coastal 




16 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017

realignment and ensuring sufficiently good habitat condition and connectivity to allow 
species to migrate with the climate.

Following the decision to leave the EU, we are undertaking a fundamental review of our 
whole environmental policy framework. This will support our 25 Year Environment Plan, 
which will have natural capital considerations at its heart and will be informed by the 
findings of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017. It will also be informed by the 
work of the Natural Capital Committee, which is working closely with the Adaptation 
Sub-Committee.

2.5 Risks to domestic and international food production and trade 
(‘more action needed’)

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report sets out how extreme 
weather can affect international food production, trade and supply chains. Longer-term 
incremental changes in climate will affect agricultural productivity in regions that are 
important for food production. At the same time, climate change will present risks and 
opportunities for domestic production, with the resilience of UK food systems dependent 
on the stewardship of natural resources including soils and responses to international 
markets. The Evidence Report concludes that there is a need for policy intervention over 
the next five years to manage the potential impacts of these risks on food prices in the UK.

The Government recognises that climate change will present significant risks to the 
availability and supply of food in the UK. Food supply has been identified as one of the 
13 UK Critical National Infrastructure sectors and we work closely with industry to ensure 
the security and resilience of supply. The resilience of food supply chains is regularly 
tested by severe weather and other events, and consistently performs well. The Evidence 
Report’s recommendation that new policy is needed to manage risks to UK food prices 
therefore does not align with the findings from our own research, including that carried 
out for the UK Food Security Assessment in 2009 and reviewed in 2012. The 
Government takes a more optimistic view of the levels of resilience that are achieved 
through functioning markets and diverse sources of supply.

The Government recognises that UK food security is built on access to a wide variety of 
markets, including through a rules-based world trading system operating alongside food 
production in the UK. When the UK held the chair of the G20 Agricultural Markets 
Information Systems (AMIS) in 2014/15, we agreed a protocol with key partner countries 
to improve the response to price spikes. We will continue to support this initiative by 
improving transparency and accountability and introducing robust evaluation of 
the protocol.

We agree with the Adaptation Sub-Committee that food production and security is a 
clear research priority. The Government has already carried out research into the risks to 
food supply from extreme weather events, including the potential impacts of tidal flooding 
on supply chains through seaports and the energy dependency of food chains. Looking 
forward, Research Council funding, together with our Centres for Agricultural Innovation, 




 2. The UK Government’s assessment of priority risks and opportunities 17

will help to improve understanding of the risks to the resilience of our food system. We 
will be reviewing the UK Food Security Assessment during the course of this Parliament, 
and are currently scoping the priority areas on which to concentrate.

2.6 New and emerging pests and diseases, and invasive non-native 
species, affecting people, plants and animals (‘research priority’)

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report describes how new and 
emerging pests and diseases – including invasive non-native species – have the potential 
to cause severe impacts on people, animals and plants. It concludes that there is an 
urgent need for research in the next five years to improve our understanding of how 
climate change will affect the threat of pests and diseases and the best approaches to 
monitor, detect and manage outbreaks and develop resilience to disease (eg through 
developing new crop varieties and breeding techniques). It finds that the evidence is not 
yet clear as to what extent surveillance is effective in identifying risks, or whether 
resources are prioritised towards those vectors and pathogens that pose the biggest 
challenge in the changing climate. Research is also needed to improve the evidence about 
the impact of endemic diseases in a changing environment.

The Government supports the conclusions of the Evidence Report and is already 
undertaking investigations into the impacts of climate change on plant health and the 
potential for climate change to increase the risk from pests. This work will lead to 
improvements in our risk assessments to ensure that we target the pests and diseases 
that pose the greatest risks. The UK Plant Health Risk Register, accessible through the 
new UK Plant Health Information Portal,6 compares risks posed by different plant pests 
and pathogens and prioritises actions. We carry out collaborative horizon-scanning and 
information-sharing activities with international organisations, such as the European and 
Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation, to provide early warning of new pest threats.

The UK has a proven system in place for monitoring international disease threats to 
human and animal health. As an example, Public Health England undertakes invasive 
mosquito surveillance with 30 seaports and airports and at key goods importers and 
motorway service stations leading away from ports of entry in south-east England. We 
work collaboratively with industry to assess and manage pest risk, as demonstrated by 
our work on Bluetongue disease and the Schmallenberg virus. We also produce an 
international forward look to improve forecasting of outbreaks by seeking to identify links 
between meteorological data and geophysical impacts, and public and animal 
health threats.

Horizon-scanning is also carried out for new invasive non-native species likely to pose 
a significant risk if they arrive in the UK. These threats are formal assessments using 
a comprehensive risk framework that takes climate change into account.

3. Assessment of priority risks and 
opportunities for the Devolved Governments

The risks and opportunities from climate change will vary across the UK because of 
geography and the policy frameworks that exist in the different countries. In addition to 
summarising the priorities for the UK, the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 
Evidence Report identifies the priorities for each of the countries in the UK in separate 
national summaries.7 These are based on the UK-wide assessment, but take account of 
the particular risks to each country and where urgent action is required. In this section, we 
describe the risks that are considered priorities for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland 
and the general approach being taken by the Devolved Governments to manage these.

3.1 Scotland

The Scottish Government will use and build on the assessment of the key areas of risk set 
out in the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report national summary 
for Scotland as it moves forward with implementing its Adaptation Programme. In most 
risk areas, the assessment for Scotland reflects similar issues elsewhere in the UK. 
Particular Scottish issues include:

Risk to species and habitats from the changing climate More action 
neededRisks to soils and natural carbon stores

Risks to people, communities and buildings from flooding

Research 
priority

Risks to coastal areas from sea-level rise combined with extreme weather

Risks to marine species from ocean changes

Risks to health and well-being

Scotland has its own climate change legislation: the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. 
Scotland’s Climate Change Adaptation Framework (2009) was replaced by Scotland’s first 
statutory Adaptation Programme in May 2014 (Climate Ready Scotland: Scottish Climate 
Change Adaptation Programme). Two annual reports on the Adaptation Programme were 
published by the Scottish Government in May 2015 and May 2016. The UK Climate 
Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report national summary for Scotland was 
published in July 2016 and the first independent assessment of progress under

 3. Assessment of priority risks and opportunities for the Devolved Governments 19

Scotland’s Adaptation Programme,8 commissioned by the Scottish Government under 
the 2009 Act, was published by the Adaptation Sub-Committee in September 2016.

The Scottish Government has been developing and improving its adaptation response, for 
example with new indicators and reporting duties on public bodies and the new National 
Centre for Resilience. The Scottish Government will continue to develop its approach 
based on the evidence, advice and recommendations of the Adaptation Sub-Committee, 
both in the next annual report on the Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme (to 
be published in May 2017) and the next Adaptation Programme (to be published in 2019).

3.2 Wales

The Welsh Government endorses the conclusions of the UK Climate Change Risk 
Assessment 2017 Evidence Report national summary for Wales. Some 49 risks and 
opportunities have been identified, with the most important risks to Wales summarised 
as follows:

Risks to infrastructure (from all sources of flooding)

More action 
needed

Risk to public water supplies from drought and low flows

Risks from some land management practices exacerbating flood risk

Risks to ecosystems and agriculture businesses from changes in climatic 
conditions

Risks to communities from all sources of flooding and sea-level rise

Research 
priority

Risks to infrastructure, business and buildings from high river flows, 
erosion and extreme weather

Risks and opportunities from changes to agriculture and forestry 
productivity

Risks to people’s health and well-being and associated service delivery 
from high temperatures, flooding and extreme weather

The Welsh Government’s actions on climate change adaptation are described in the 
Climate Change Strategy for Wales: Adaptation Delivery Plan (2010). The actions in this 
plan will be reviewed in light of the new evidence, with a view to publishing a new delivery 
plan in 2018. The Welsh Government will work with the UK and other Devolved 
Governments where there is common interest, and will be engaging the academic 
community for support in addressing research priorities.

20 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017

At a local level, there are statutory requirements under the Well-being of Future 
Generations (Wales) Act 2015 for Public Services Boards in Wales to reference the 
UK Climate Change Risk Assessment when assessing well-being in their area.

3.3 Northern Ireland

Due to geographical differences and variation in the projected changes to the Northern 
Ireland climate, the priority risks identified in the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 
2017 Evidence Report national summary for Northern Ireland are not all the same as those 
identified for the UK more generally.

The national summary for Northern Ireland identifies a number of areas where stronger 
action and further research are needed in the next five years, and these are summarised 
below. These findings and recommendations and the categorisation of the risks have 
been adopted by executive departments as a basis for adaptation planning. There are no 
areas of dispute or issues within the summary that are contentious.

Risks to soils, farming, natural carbon stores, species and coastal 
habitats

More action 
needed

Flooding risk to (interdependent) infrastructure (sewers, transport 
networks)

Potential benefits to people from reduced cold

Risks to international food production and trade

Changes in agricultural and forestry productivity and land suitability and 
impacts on freshwater and marine ecosystems

Research 
priority

Risks to infrastructure services from coastal flooding and erosion

Risks to people from high temperatures, changes in air quality, health 
and social care delivery and vector-borne pathogens

Risks to communities and businesses from flooding

Risks to business from reduced employee productivity due to 
infrastructure disruption and higher temperatures

Risks to historic environment and buildings

Risks and opportunities in global food production

Detailed responses and actions to the findings and recommendations in the Northern 
Ireland summary will contribute to the development of the second Northern Ireland 
Climate Change Adaptation Programme, to be published in 2019.




 4. Next steps 21

4. Next steps

The first National Adaptation Programme, published in 2013, sets out over 370 actions for 
the UK Government, businesses, councils, civil society and academia to address the 
findings of the first UK Climate Change Risk Assessment: Government Report and to build 
the nation’s resilience to climate change. The most recent review of the National 
Adaptation Programme9 by the Adaptation Sub-Committee in 2015 found that 109 of the 
actions have been completed and 215 are on track. We continue to monitor progress and 
the Adaptation Sub-Committee will issue its next report on progress in summer 2017.

Adaptation to climate change is an integral part of policy across all levels of the UK 
Government. Defra has its own significant interest, tackling some of the highest priority 
risks such as those relating to flooding, water security, food production, environment and 
biodiversity. Other departments, such as the Department for Communities and Local 
Government, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the 
Department of Health, are working together to address risks to health, well-being and 
productivity due to increasing temperatures.

The second National Adaptation Programme will respond to the risks set out in this UK 
Climate Change Risk Assessment and is due to be published in 2018. In developing the 
programme, we will continue to work with business and industry, identifying where UK 
Government action can support their resilience and how they themselves can take 
adaptation forwards.
