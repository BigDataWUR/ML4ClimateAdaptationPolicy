1.  Our climate is changing and the impacts from it are likely to affect most of  us in some way 
during our lifetimes. There have always been natural fluctuations in climate but observational 
records show that we are seeing rates of  change far greater than those experienced in 
recent history. Precise satellite measurements show that the global mean sea level is rising 
by an average of  over 3 millimetres per year and accelerating, average annual sea surface 
temperature is rising, with each of  the last 11 years among the 12 warmest on record and 
Arctic sea-ice retreated to its smallest ever observed extent in September last year.1

2.  The government has assessed the risks posed by the changing climate.2 Extreme events, 
such as the flooding which occurred throughout the country in late 2012, or the drought of  
early 2012, are likely to become more frequent and more severe in the coming decades, 
bringing potential disruption to the economy. However, the government has also found that 
there are opportunities for some businesses who do take action.

3.  This Programme has been drawn up by the government, industry and other non government 
organisations working together. It contains a mix of  policies and actions to help us to adapt 
successfully to future weather conditions, by dealing with the risks and making the most of  
the opportunities. 

Adaptation supports growth

4.  Changes to our climate will affect different parts of  the economy in different ways. 
For example, there may be direct economic impacts on agricultural yields or crop choice. 
There may also be less obvious indirect effects. For example, power outages from storms 
could affect businesses, households and public services alike, causing widespread disruption.

5.  Reacting to current climate or extreme weather events is often expensive. As an illustration of  
how costly this can be, the UK floods in 2007 were estimated to have cost businesses 
£740 million. This is on average around £100,000 per affected business, with some taking 
about 27 weeks to return to normal operating capacity. Some did not survive at all.3 

6.  However, future climate and economic circumstances are uncertain, and with uncertainty 
comes risk that needs to be accounted for. Through good risk management, organisations 
can become more resilient and potentially gain economic benefit. It has been estimated that, 
in the wider European context, every £1 spent on adaptation represents 4 times its value in 
potential damages avoided.4

7.  Some measures, called ‘low-regret actions’, make economic sense because they deliver 
benefits now and are feasible under virtually any future climate scenario. Examples include 
having in place better water efficiency measures, a business continuity plan, checking 
insurance policies and gaining a better understanding of  supply-chain risks. Many other 
measures are similarly low cost and therefore benefits over time need only be modest to 
ensure they are cost-effective.

8.  Measures which are designed to be beneficial over the longer term need to be flexible enough 
so that organisations can respond to the changing nature of  climate risks. Failure to do so 
could result in companies making long-term investments which bear sunk costs and which 
cannot be adapted to deal with climate change. Similarly, incorporating flexibility in investment 
decisions is likely to be cost-effective when considering the full range of  possible 
climate scenarios.

9.  Appraisal methods, such as real options analysis, help decision makers weigh up long-term 
investment options under deep uncertainty and avoid this kind of  potentially expensive 
lock-in.5 

10.  Proactive adaptation planning can stimulate enterprise in a global market for adaptation 
goods and services.6 In 2010-11, these goods and services were worth £2.1 billion, with over 
21,000 employees in the UK. In the same period, global activities were worth an estimated 
£65.8 billion. This is an emerging market with a domestic growth rate of  3.9% for 2011-12 and 
a forecasted UK growth rate of  7.1% by 2017-18.7

11.  If  adapting to climate change is in the private interests of  an individual and an organisation 
then it should occur naturally and without the government’s intervention (except in areas of  
the government’s responsibility). This is already happening in some cases. However, barriers 
to adaptation do exist. To take advantage of  the economic and social benefits of  adaptation 
we need to overcome these barriers. Recent research identifies these barriers and the role 
of  the government.8 The National Adaptation Programme (NAP) demonstrates how the 
government is beginning to do this.

The Climate Change Risk Assessment and the National 
Adaptation Programme

12.  The Climate Change Risk Assessment 2012 (CCRA) for the UK brought together the best 
available evidence, using a consistent framework to identify the risks and opportunities related 
to climate change. The assessment distilled approximately 700 potential risks down to more 
than 100 for detailed review.

13.  The government’s response to the CCRA, which meets the requirements laid down in the 
Climate Change Act 2008, is the first NAP. In developing the NAP for England, we have taken 
the highest order risks from the CCRA and working in partnership with businesses, local 
government and other organisations, have developed objectives, policies and proposals to 
address them. This report sets out the progress we have achieved through the Programme 
and describes what the government considers to be the most urgent areas for action.

Working together

14.  Some of  the policies and proposals highlighted in this document are the responsibility of  the 
government. However, other policies and proposals cover areas of  joint responsibility where 
we need to develop shared solutions. Local government, industry, communities and civil 
society all have important roles to play. In developing the Programme we have started to gain 
a collective understanding of  the most urgent climate risks as well as widespread commitment 
to action.

15.  This report therefore describes not only the government’s policies and actions, but also those 
which have been developed by those outside the government. The Environment Agency’s (EA) 
Climate Ready Support Service has been a major provider of  tools and knowledge to those 
organisations who are developing their own responses (see below).

Environment Agency’s Climate Ready Support Service

In October 2011 the EA took on a new role to provide advice and support to businesses, the 
public sector and other organisations on adapting to a changing climate. The service is based on 
customer needs and feedback and aims to help organisations build their own capacity to adapt, 
incorporating climate risk management into their business decision making.

The Climate Ready Support Service provides direct support and online information to help 
organisations assess their sensitivity to a changing climate and take steps to manage their 
climate risks. Through the Service the EA is working with partners in priority sectors to provide 
tailored tools, guidance and training to enable them to understand and respond to the challenges 
of  a changing climate. Established partnerships are with the Met Office, the Local Government 
Association, Climate UK and the Climate Change Partnerships. In addition, the EA’s network of  
staff  across England helps to engage customers directly by providing information on the advice 
available through the online services and work with partners.

16.  Organisations depend, to some extent, on the actions of  others in managing their own risks. 
The Climate Change Act enables the Secretary of  State to direct certain organisations, 
for example those with responsibilities for critical national infrastructure, to prepare reports on 
the steps they are taking and will take to deal with the risks from a changing climate. 
This is the so-called Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP). Alongside this report, the 
government is publishing a report on its strategy for exercising this power over the next 
5 years. The Secretary of  State does not intend to direct organisations to report. Rather, 
in line with the collaborative approach the government has taken to the NAP as a whole, 
he will invite progress updates from organisations which have previously reported and new 
reports from a number of  priority organisations.

17.  The government is also supporting the building of  networks of  organisations that may share 
common risks, for example the Infrastructure Operators Adaptation Forum.

This report on the National Adaptation Programme

18.  A climate-ready society will understand where and when to take the necessary action 
to minimise climate impacts and the effects of  extreme weather events. Buildings and 
infrastructure, health and emergency services, the natural environment, businesses and 
the agriculture and forestry sectors will be resilient to the risks and ready to maximise the 
opportunities. This vision has guided our approach to developing the Programme.


 

Vision: “A society which makes timely, far-sighted and well-informed decisions to address the 
risks and opportunities posed by a changing climate.”

19.  Each chapter sets out a particular vision of  what is needed to ensure that the sector on which 
it focuses is adequately prepared. The chapters broadly follow the structure of  the CCRA, 
with the addition of  a chapter on the role of  local government in delivering effective adaptation 
across all sectors of  society.

20.  Each chapter describes which risks highlighted by the CCRA and in subsequent consultation 
with Defra partners require urgent attention. In selecting the areas on which to focus, we 
were guided by the magnitude, confidence and urgency scores assigned during the analysis 
underpinning the CCRA. This placed the spotlight on those risks needing urgent attention due 
to confident expectation of  high magnitude impacts or long planning horizons, for example, 
large infrastructure projects. 

21.  Some CCRA risks are considered ‘urgent’ even though the state of  knowledge of  the risk 
is relatively low compared with its potential magnitude. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, 
ocean acidification and the health impacts of  increased exposure to UV/sunlight are examples 
of  areas requiring a stronger evidence base, to allow a more robust re-assessment of  risk. 
Risks covered in minimal detail by the CCRA but later identified by practitioners as requiring 
further attention, such as potential impacts on Information and Communications Technology 
(ICT) infrastructure, were also added to this category.

22.  Objectives have been developed to address the greatest risks and opportunities. 
These objectives cover 4 main areas across the programme:

 • Increasing awareness

 • Increasing resilience to current extremes

 • Taking timely action for long-lead time measures

 • Addressing major evidence gaps.

23.  Each chapter has its own set of  objectives to reflect its specific priorities, as agreed with those 
organisations that were most interested in the area. The chapters then describe the most 
significant actions for the government and for other organisations that will help to meet these 
objectives. There are a number of  cross-cutting issues and to understand the full picture the 
chapters need to be considered as part of  the whole Programme. However, two cross-cutting 
risks clearly dominate the list of  highest priorities and are recognised as important to every 
chapter. These are flooding and pressure on water resources. Objectives and actions to 
address these risks are found in a number of  chapters. 

24.  The Programme will inevitably evolve as knowledge grows, allowing re-evaluation of  policy 
based on the underlying evidence.

The Devolved Administrations

25.  The NAP is primarily for England but also covers reserved, excepted and non-devolved 
matters. The individual Devolved Administrations are developing their own programmes 
and the government is working with them to share areas of  common interest, to ensure a 
consistent approach in the shape and focus of  all the programmes.

  Scotland: A Scottish Adaptation Programme will address the risks identified for Scotland 
in the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment and will be published in 2013 after a period of  
consultation. It will replace the existing Adaptation Framework which already contributes to 
building resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change.

  Wales: The Climate Change Strategy for Wales sets out an adaptation framework to 
present a national, co-ordinated approach to ensure that Wales understands the risks and 
opportunities that climate change presents and is well placed to adapt in a sustainable way. 
The Welsh Government is developing Sectoral Adaptation Plans across 5 important sectors 
and putting in place programmes for embedding resilience measures against extreme weather 
events and climate change into all it delivers.9 These Plans will form part of  the next Annual 
Progress Report (due to be published in Autumn 2013).

  Northern Ireland: A cross-departmental Northern Ireland Adaptation Programme is due to 
be published later in 2013. Progress on climate change adaptation is reported annually to the 
Northern Ireland Executive by the Cross-Departmental Working Group on Climate Change.

Risks related to impacts in other countries

26.   This NAP has focused on the risks to impacts in England as well as covering reserved, 
excepted and non-devolved matters. However, we are also likely to feel the effects from 
impacts in the rest of  the UK and abroad. Understanding the nature of  these indirect impacts 
is highly complex because of  the number of  variables involved.

27.  Development and economic progress will, in many cases, be the most effective way of  
helping countries to adapt, as well as helping to create stability. A Met Office Hadley Centre 
project has assessed the impacts from climate change on 24 countries to provide a better 
understanding of  what the global effects may be.10 In addition, the government continues 
to support programmes helping the poorest and most vulnerable people in climate change 
‘hot-spots’, as well as identifying and refining tools which are cost-effective and sustainable. 
The UK is an active participant in the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), the global 
comprehensive agreement on disaster risk reduction. In 2012, the UK was the first country 
to undergo a peer review to assess its progress in implementing the HFA. The report of  the 
peer review commented that “The National Adaptation Programme, based on the Climate 
Change Risk Assessment, is an efficient tool to mainstream adaptation to climate change 
throughout the country, from national to local level. It helps to influence planning to reduce 
risks accordingly, especially with respect to the risk of  flooding, the number one natural risk  
in the UK.”11

28.  Our prosperity and national security depend heavily on global stability. The impacts of   
climate change may threaten this stability by affecting the availability and accessibility of  
food, water, land and energy, as well as the stability of  critical infrastructure. We have already 
seen evidence of  acute effects from these impacts in low income and weakly governed 
countries. However, we have also seen the effects in some emerging economies and in the 
developed world.

29.  Many of  the big global risks are being considered as part of  the work of  the inter-
departmental Resources and Risks Working Group. However, Defra has also commissioned 
research by Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) on the international threats and opportunities 
to the UK.12 Some of  the main findings are set out below.

PWC Report on International Threats and Opportunities from Climate 
Change

•  The threats associated with climate change internationally can be an “order of  magnitude” 
larger than domestic threats for some thematic areas, in particular business (trade and 
investment) and food (imports)

•  Certain foodstuffs and energy are concentrated in relatively few countries. Climate change 
is highly likely to exacerbate volatility of  import prices and cause disruptions of  supply, over 
the short-term (to 2020s). Over the longer term (2050s to 2080s) the increasing impacts of  
climate change could lead to more pervasive systemic changes to trade in food and other 
physical commodities, with knock-on effects in other areas such as health, conflict and global 
governance

•  The UK has its strongest links with industrialised countries, generally considered to be less 
vulnerable to climate change. However recent climatic events in such countries, for example 
drought in the American south-west, show that our exposure to these costs can be high.

Role of the EU

30.  The EU can play an important role in supplementing national action by identifying the most 
important issues related to climate change for Europe, both at global and regional level, 
and by creating a strong common understanding of  the opportunities and risks at the 
European level.

31.  The EU Adaptation Strategy was published in April 2013. It encourages all Member States to 
adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies and the European Commission will be providing 
guidelines for formulating them. Member States will not be legally required to meet the 
guidelines as they are designed to help EU countries to develop, implement and review 
adaptation policies according to their national circumstances. However, the government 
expects that the NAP will broadly be in line with the future guidelines.

32.  Another important aspect of  the EU strategy is that it aims to ensure that climate change 
adaptation is embedded within existing EU policies and instruments in ways consistent with 
better regulation, subsidiarity and value for money. In addition it also focuses on helping to 
fill evidence gaps and on strengthening the sharing of  knowledge, data and best practice 
between Member States through Climate-ADAPT.

Monitoring and evaluation

33.  The CCRA provided a basis for monitoring preparedness for climate change in the UK. 
However, it focused on risk magnitude over the longer term and gave little consideration to 
the effectiveness of  existing adaptive capacity. We now need a framework that will help us to 
identify whether the actions and policies contained in this Programme are making a difference 
to our vulnerability in the near-term. The government has a role to play in helping to provide a 
hub for the monitoring of  data, which could enable adaptation outcomes to be tracked on the 
ground over the long-term and usefully inform future climate change risk assessments.

34.  The following types of  indicators will help provide a picture of  progress and will also serve as 
evidence for the next CCRA:

 •  process-based markers, such as whether planned policies have been implemented. These 
can give an idea of  direction of  travel

 •  quantitative data, such as statistics on trends in factors that influence risks from flooding 
and water scarcity, as collated by the EA; these provide a strong foundation for assessing 
overall adaptation in relevant areas.

35.  Discussions about the most appropriate framework are continuing. However, our preferred 
approach asks the EA to monitor, through compiling relevant quantitative data on trends 
in factors that are likely either to increase or decrease our vulnerability to climate risks. 
Following this approach, the Adaptation Sub-Committee (ASC) of  the Committee on Climate 
Change would carry out its statutory duty under the Climate Change Act to assess progress 
towards implementation of  objectives, proposals and policies highlighted in this report and the 
Register of  Actions, with assessments published in 2015 and every two years hence.13

Next steps 

36.  The government is considering how to approach the next CCRA, due in 2017. The next risk 
assessment will need to take account of  new evidence on the nature of  climate risks and the 
impacts of  climate change for the UK. It will also need to reflect on the extent to which the 
risks have changed as a result of  actions undertaken in this Programme and beyond.

PWC Report on International Threats and Opportunities from Climate 
Change

•  The threats associated with climate change internationally can be an “order of  magnitude” 
larger than domestic threats for some thematic areas, in particular business (trade and 
investment) and food (imports)

•  Certain foodstuffs and energy are concentrated in relatively few countries. Climate change 
is highly likely to exacerbate volatility of  import prices and cause disruptions of  supply, over 
the short-term (to 2020s). Over the longer term (2050s to 2080s) the increasing impacts of  
climate change could lead to more pervasive systemic changes to trade in food and other 
physical commodities, with knock-on effects in other areas such as health, conflict and global 
governance

•  The UK has its strongest links with industrialised countries, generally considered to be less 
vulnerable to climate change. However recent climatic events in such countries, for example 
drought in the American south-west, show that our exposure to these costs can be high.

Role of the EU

30.  The EU can play an important role in supplementing national action by identifying the most 
important issues related to climate change for Europe, both at global and regional level, 
and by creating a strong common understanding of  the opportunities and risks at the 
European level.

31.  The EU Adaptation Strategy was published in April 2013. It encourages all Member States to 
adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies and the European Commission will be providing 
guidelines for formulating them. Member States will not be legally required to meet the 
guidelines as they are designed to help EU countries to develop, implement and review 
adaptation policies according to their national circumstances. However, the government 
expects that the NAP will broadly be in line with the future guidelines.

32.  Another important aspect of  the EU strategy is that it aims to ensure that climate change 
adaptation is embedded within existing EU policies and instruments in ways consistent with 
better regulation, subsidiarity and value for money. In addition it also focuses on helping to 
fill evidence gaps and on strengthening the sharing of  knowledge, data and best practice 
between Member States through Climate-ADAPT.

Monitoring and evaluation

33.  The CCRA provided a basis for monitoring preparedness for climate change in the UK. 
However, it focused on risk magnitude over the longer term and gave little consideration to 
the effectiveness of  existing adaptive capacity. We now need a framework that will help us to 
identify whether the actions and policies contained in this Programme are making a difference 
to our vulnerability in the near-term. The government has a role to play in helping to provide a 
hub for the monitoring of  data, which could enable adaptation outcomes to be tracked on the 
ground over the long-term and usefully inform future climate change risk assessments.

34.  The following types of  indicators will help provide a picture of  progress and will also serve as 
evidence for the next CCRA:

 •  process-based markers, such as whether planned policies have been implemented. These 
can give an idea of  direction of  travel

 •  quantitative data, such as statistics on trends in factors that influence risks from flooding 
and water scarcity, as collated by the EA; these provide a strong foundation for assessing 
overall adaptation in relevant areas.

35.  Discussions about the most appropriate framework are continuing. However, our preferred 
approach asks the EA to monitor, through compiling relevant quantitative data on trends 
in factors that are likely either to increase or decrease our vulnerability to climate risks. 
Following this approach, the Adaptation Sub-Committee (ASC) of  the Committee on Climate 
Change would carry out its statutory duty under the Climate Change Act to assess progress 
towards implementation of  objectives, proposals and policies highlighted in this report and the 
Register of  Actions, with assessments published in 2015 and every two years hence.13

Next steps 

36.  The government is considering how to approach the next CCRA, due in 2017. The next risk 
assessment will need to take account of  new evidence on the nature of  climate risks and the 
impacts of  climate change for the UK. It will also need to reflect on the extent to which the 
risks have changed as a result of  actions undertaken in this Programme and beyond.

Vision: “Buildings and places and the people who live and work in them are resilient to a 
changing climate and extreme weather and organisations in the built environment sector have  
an increased capacity to address the risks and take the opportunities from climate change.”

37.  Most of  the highest order risks for the built environment highlighted in the CCRA are 
associated with the impacts of  flooding, which is expected to become more common 
throughout the twenty-first century. The cost of  expected annual damage to residential 
properties alone from tidal and river flooding in England and Wales is projected to increase 
from £640 million at present to over £1.1 billion by the 2020s under the CCRA mid range 
climate change scenario. This does not account for potential population increases.

38.  Non-residential buildings are also at risk. The numbers of  English and Welsh hospitals and 
schools in areas exposed to a significant risk of  river and tidal flooding are projected to rise 
from around 53 hospitals and 927 schools currently to between 59 and 89 hospitals and 
1,000 to 1,700 schools by the 2050s.14

39.  In addition to the major damage that floods can cause, repair costs and rising insurance 
premiums can have a longer-term impact. Flooding can also cause significant distress to 
people affected. The impacts on health are explored in Chapter 4.

40.  Temperatures, particularly in the summer, are projected to rise, posing risks to health and 
wellbeing and increasing the demand for energy for summer cooling. The Urban Heat Island 
(UHI) effect, caused when heat is absorbed and then slowly released by hard surfaces, 
is already observed around the country and is predicted to push urban temperatures 
even higher.

41.  Increasing pressure on water resources is the third important risk in this sector. Buildings 
will need to become increasingly water efficient as changes in water availability, particularly 
reductions in the summer, may lead to a less reliable supply. By the 2050s, the number of  
people in the UK living in areas affected by water supply-demand deficits could be between 
27 million and 59 million.

42.  These risks affect other sectors too, so an approach is needed that recognises the breadth of  
climate impacts and avoids maladaptation, both nationally and locally.

Focus area 1: Flood and coastal erosion risk management

Objective 1: To work with individuals, communities and organisations to reduce the threat of 
flooding and coastal erosion, including that resulting from climate change, by understanding 
the risks of flooding and coastal erosion, working together to put in place long-term plans to 
manage these risks and making sure that other plans take account of them.


 

43.  This first objective is shared with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management 
(FCERM) Strategy for England.15 The Strategy provides a framework for communities to develop 
local partnerships and solutions to the flood and coastal erosion risks they face and it underpins 
the partnership approach to funding flood and coastal resilience projects. The Strategy includes 
long-term planning, avoidance of  inappropriate development in high risk areas, improved flood 
management infrastructure, increased public awareness and improved flood detection/warning.

The National Flood Forum

Flooding can have a devastating impact on people’s lives and more people are at increasing risk 
due to changes in the weather, population growth, increased suburbanisation and pressure on 
the drainage system. The National Flood Forum is a charity that supports and represents people 
and communities at risk of  flooding by:

• working with people to understand and reduce their risks of  flooding

• helping them to prepare for flooding and to reduce its impact should it occur

• helping people to recover their lives if  they have experienced flooding

•  working with the government and agencies to ensure that community perspectives on flood 
risk are effectively built into policy and operational delivery

44.  The government plans to spend £2.3 billion on flood and coastal erosion risk management 
over the 4 years to March 2015. The funding will enable 165,000 households to benefit from 
new and improved defences by 2015, targeted at those most at risk and living in deprived 
areas. In addition to government funding, private and local council funding is now coming 
forward to pay for flood defences, with £148 million expected over the same period.

Investing in flood risk management

In 2012, the government announced an additional £120 million of  funding included in the 
£2.3 billion above to speed up the delivery of  flood defences aimed at protecting up to 60,000 
homes in England. Up to half  of  this investment is being focused on areas where flood alleviation 
will unlock growth and regeneration, potentially delivering up to £1 billion of  economic benefits. 
The additional funding is being phased in: £35 million in 2013-2014 and £85 million in 2014-2015.

45.  Managing flood risk includes effectively responding to incidents.16 By taking an integrated 
approach to flood detection and forecasting, warnings can be issued in good time to minimise 
potential loss of  life and damage. The EA and Met Office will continue to work together to 
develop and improve the national flood detection and forecasting services provided by the Flood 
Forecasting Centre, including for surface water. This will include:

 • more accurate forecasts of  flooding from all sources

 • warnings and flood information that are as geographically specific as possible

 • longer lead times for flood forecasts and warnings 

 • more innovative ways of  sharing locally specific information

46.  All risk management partners need to find better ways to support recovery from incidents. 
Local flood risk management strategies should support communities and individuals and 
Defra, the EA and local councils will work together to help develop a single information portal 
to share consistent high-level information on flooding.

47.  In the UK, cover for flooding is included as a standard part of  most buildings and contents 
insurance policies. Insurance therefore plays an important role in helping households 
manage the potential financial consequences of  their property being flooded. To date, flood 
insurance has been widely available mainly due to agreements between government and 
insurers. Premiums have also been kept affordable because customers at risk have not been 
differentiated from those not at risk, as information on flood risk has been poor. With recent 
advances in flood mapping, insurers are increasingly able to set premiums more reflective of  
risk. The government is committed to ensuring the continued availability and affordability of  
flood insurance to high risk households and the Water Bill is the obvious vehicle to achieve this.

48.  Lead Local Flood Authorities manage the risks of  flooding from surface water, minor water 
courses and groundwater across their areas and take measures to address these.17 How 
flooding from rivers, the sea and sewers interacts with these risks may also be considered. 
Lead Local Flood Authorities have to develop, maintain, apply and monitor their Local Flood 
Risk Management Strategies. As part of  the delivery of  the Flood Risk Regulations 2009 
an improved understanding of  surface water flood risk is being developed. The CCRA was 
unable to undertake a detailed analysis of  the spatial variation of  surface water flood risk. 
This is therefore a priority area for further risk assessment and action.

Management of surface water flood risk in London

Drain London is a £3.2 million multi-year programme to manage surface water flood risk in 
London. It is managed by the Greater London Authority on behalf  of  the boroughs and aims to:

• understand where surface water flooding may present a risk to people and property

• build the capacity of  boroughs to manage surface water flood risk

•  create pilot projects that demonstrate the financial and quality of  life benefits from proactive 
flood risk management

•  create a pipeline of  projects to secure significant investment in London to understand the ‘gap’ 
between the level of  rainfall that London’s drainage systems can cope with today and the level 
that London may need to cope with in the future

Focus area 2: Spatial planning

Objective 2: To provide a clear local planning framework to enable all participants in the 
planning system to deliver sustainable new development, including infrastructure that 
minimises vulnerability and provides resilience to the impacts of climate change.

49.  The planning system is important for promoting sustainable development. The National 
Planning Policy Framework 2012 (NPPF) is clear that local planning authorities, working 
closely with their communities, should proactively plan to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change. They should take full account of  flood risk, coastal change and water supply and 
demand considerations. There is also a statutory duty requiring local authorities to include 
policies in their local plans which help them adapt to climate change.18

50.  Every local authority area should have a clear local plan, which sets out how local people 
want their community to develop. These should be consistent with the NPPF and will be used 
to judge planning applications and appeals. In preparing their local plans, local planning 
authorities are under a duty to cooperate with neighbouring authorities and other public 
bodies on planning issues that cross administrative boundaries, like flooding.

51.  Under the NPPF, local planning authorities’ local plans and decisions should steer 
development away from areas of  flood risk where possible, taking into account the impacts of  
climate change. Where there are no suitable and reasonably available sites in areas with a 
lower probability of  flooding, new development should only be permitted if  it will be safe and 
resilient to flooding. New developments should not increase flood risk elsewhere and where 
possible, overall flood risk should be reduced. Local plans should be supported by a Strategic 
Flood Risk Assessment, which also takes into account the impacts of  climate change.

52.  Before local plans can be adopted, they are examined at a public inquiry conducted by 
an independent planning inspector, to decide whether the plan is ‘sound’. To be sound, a 
local plan must be consistent with national policy (including on climate change) and based 
on proportionate evidence. Local planning authorities are also required to undertake both 
a sustainability appraisal to appraise the social, environmental and economic effects of  a 
plan and a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment to assess the risks and impacts to an area 
from flooding from all sources, now and in the future, taking account of  the impacts of  
climate change. Local planning authorities must also publish monitoring reports on progress 
implementing their local plans.

53.  The NPPF is supported by planning practice guidance to help secure effective local 
implementation. However, the large amount of  current planning practice guidance can 
make it difficult for residents and businesses to work effectively with the planning system. 
A government review in 2012, led by Lord Taylor, recommended that planning practice 
guidance on climate change and flood risk should be a priority for re-issue in an updated 
and streamlined form, helping to make the planning system swifter and more accessible. 
The government responded positively to this recommendation in its overall response to Lord 
Taylor’s report, published in May 2013.

54.  The NPPF also supports the use of  green infrastructure. The work of  the sector-led Green 
Infrastructure Partnership will increase understanding of  how green infrastructure can 
mitigate the effects of  the UHI as well as delivering other benefits. The CCRA noted the 
uncertainty around this. In addition, the Local Government Association (LGA) has recently 
issued topic-based reference guides and resources to help local authorities plan for and 
provide green infrastructure in developing their local environment, to reduce and manage 
climate change impacts in urban areas.19

Green and Blue Space adaptation for urban areas and eco towns (GRaBS)

The GRaBS project, led by the Town and Country Planning Association, was one of  the first 
projects to recognise the crucial role of  green and blue space infrastructure adaptation to help 
create more resilient urban areas. The major outputs included Adaptation Action Plan Guidance 
and methodology, 7 Expert Papers, an international database of  good practice and a Risk 
and Vulnerabilities Assessment tool. 14 organisations formed a pan-European partnership 
representing responses to diverse challenges of  extreme weather. www.grabs-eu.org

55.  Businesses and professions in the built environment sector are responsible for the

that the country needs. Investors and developers will be instrumental in making these 
buildings resilient, but they need to know how to do this.

Planning Policy Framework 2012 (NPPF) is clear that local planning authorities, working 
closely with their communities, should proactively plan to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change. They should take full account of  flood risk, coastal change and water supply and 
demand considerations. There is also a statutory duty requiring local authorities to include 
policies in their local plans which help them adapt to climate change.18

50.  Every local authority area should have a clear local plan, which sets out how local people 
want their community to develop. These should be consistent with the NPPF and will be used 
to judge planning applications and appeals. In preparing their local plans, local planning 
authorities are under a duty to cooperate with neighbouring authorities and other public 
bodies on planning issues that cross administrative boundaries, like flooding.

51.  Under the NPPF, local planning authorities’ local plans and decisions should steer 
development away from areas of  flood risk where possible, taking into account the impacts of  
climate change. Where there are no suitable and reasonably available sites in areas with a 
lower probability of  flooding, new development should only be permitted if  it will be safe and 
resilient to flooding. New developments should not increase flood risk elsewhere and where 
possible, overall flood risk should be reduced. Local plans should be supported by a Strategic 
Flood Risk Assessment, which also takes into account the impacts of  climate change.

52.  Before local plans can be adopted, they are examined at a public inquiry conducted by 
an independent planning inspector, to decide whether the plan is ‘sound’. To be sound, a 
local plan must be consistent with national policy (including on climate change) and based 
on proportionate evidence. Local planning authorities are also required to undertake both 
a sustainability appraisal to appraise the social, environmental and economic effects of  a 
plan and a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment to assess the risks and impacts to an area 
from flooding from all sources, now and in the future, taking account of  the impacts of  
climate change. Local planning authorities must also publish monitoring reports on progress 
implementing their local plans.

53.  The NPPF is supported by planning practice guidance to help secure effective local 
implementation. However, the large amount of  current planning practice guidance can 
make it difficult for residents and businesses to work effectively with the planning system. 
A government review in 2012, led by Lord Taylor, recommended that planning practice 
guidance on climate change and flood risk should be a priority for re-issue in an updated 
and streamlined form, helping to make the planning system swifter and more accessible. 
The government responded positively to this recommendation in its overall response to Lord 
Taylor’s report, published in May 2013.

54.  The NPPF also supports the use of  green infrastructure. The work of  the sector-led Green 
Infrastructure Partnership will increase understanding of  how green infrastructure can 
mitigate the effects of  the UHI as well as delivering other benefits. The CCRA noted the 
uncertainty around this. In addition, the Local Government Association (LGA) has recently 
issued topic-based reference guides and resources to help local authorities plan for and 
provide green infrastructure in developing their local environment, to reduce and manage 
climate change impacts in urban areas.19

Green and Blue Space adaptation for urban areas and eco towns (GRaBS)

The GRaBS project, led by the Town and Country Planning Association, was one of  the first 
projects to recognise the crucial role of  green and blue space infrastructure adaptation to help 
create more resilient urban areas. The major outputs included Adaptation Action Plan Guidance 
and methodology, 7 Expert Papers, an international database of  good practice and a Risk 
and Vulnerabilities Assessment tool. 14 organisations formed a pan-European partnership 
representing responses to diverse challenges of  extreme weather. www.grabs-eu.org

55.  Businesses and professions in the built environment sector are responsible for the 
development, design and construction of  the homes, workplaces, public and leisure buildings 
that the country needs. Investors and developers will be instrumental in making these 
buildings resilient, but they need to know how to do this.

56.  The Economics of  Climate Resilience Project made a number of  recommendations around 
adaptive capacity including:

 • increasing the design skills and knowledge of  organisations in the supply chain

 •  developing the supply chain for retrofits so builders and architects have access to 
equipment and information that allows them to advise on effective adaptation and residents 
have access to advice on how to adapt houses effectively

 •  addressing information failures by ensuring that targeted and engaging information is 
accessible

 •  building residents’ ability to adapt through the provision of  targeted education and 
information on behaviour change and passive measures

57.  An EA Climate Ready project aims to establish where there are adaptation skills gaps in the 
built environment sector. It will promote training materials and programmes more effectively in 
partnership with the most relevant organisations. There is a growing evidence base available 
to the sector, much of  which is promoted through the ARCCC Network.20 The Network 
promotes partner-led, co-ordinated research on adaptation in the built environment and 
infrastructure sectors and involves people from policy, practitioner and research communities 
in the development and dissemination of  targeted evidence.

Design for Future Climate

In 2010 the Technology Strategy Board launched the ‘Design for Future Climate Competition’ 
which invested £5 million in two competitions to fund the development of  strategies to adapt UK 
buildings. This innovative partnership with industry has demonstrated how to improve climate 
resilience as part of  a broader focus on sustainability in buildings and the move towards a 
low carbon future. The competition involved more than 240 companies and organisations and 
influenced 50 projects with a capital value of  over £4.2 billion.

The construction industry is experienced in making buildings more energy efficient but is less 
experienced in good adaptation practice. The ‘Design for Future Climate’ projects provide 
good examples of  how to achieve a more climate resilient built environment. There is a market 
opportunity for design teams to develop climate adaptation services. The programme is due to 
conclude in Autumn 2013 – for more information see https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/
design-for-future-climate/overview

58.  The built environment sector has recognised the particular need to develop industry-led 
guidance to address the risks of  overheating. Two relevant pieces of  work have recently been 
completed. First, the Chartered Institute of  Building Service Engineers (CIBSE) will produce 
guidance on ‘The limits of  thermal comfort: avoiding overheating in European buildings’, 
a design guidance document that will include new overheating criteria and assessment 
methodology. Second, the National House Building Council (NHBC) Foundation has 
undertaken a review of  the evidence of  overheating in new homes and issued guidance for 
house builders and designers on how to avoid the problem.

NHBC Foundation

Historically, the overheating of  homes has not been identified as much of  a problem. Older 
homes may not be as energy efficient as newer ones but they commonly have draughts to 
keep them cool during the summer. To address concerns that new homes are more at risk of  
overheating due to higher standards of  air-tightness and increased thermal insulation, NHBC 
Foundation has launched a new guide ‘Understanding overheating: where to start –  
an introduction for house builders and designers’.

59.  Climate resilience in buildings does not yet appear to be a marketable asset that can be 
reflected in sale or rental prices. This means that the costs of  adaptation may be incurred by 
one party, while the benefits accrue to another. In the built environment sector, this presents a 
significant barrier to achieving more well adapted buildings. The lack of  a properly articulated 
economic case for encouraging developers and construction companies to build climate 
resilient buildings has also been a barrier to action. To address this, Defra, EA and the 
Modern Built Environment Knowledge Transfer Network (MBE KTN) have begun a project to 
develop the business case for taking action to adapt the built environment.

Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)

BREEAM has an on-going commitment to provide a holistic and relevant assessment method to 
encourage sustainable design, construction and management. As part of  this, it is undertaking 
a comprehensive review of  the BREEAM New Construction 2011 technical criteria to assess 
whether there is any need to strengthen the detailed content or coverage of  BREEAM in relation 
to adaptation to climate change. A number of  BREEAM areas already promote adaptation in the 
built environment. However, early analysis indicates there may be scope to enhance coverage.

Where appropriate, the BREEAM technical criteria will be amended to take greater account of  a 
building’s capacity to adapt to climate change. Any changes identified will be reflected in the next 
version of  the BREEAM New Construction scheme, likely to be released in 2014.

Focus area 4: Making homes and communities more resilient

Objective 5: To increase the resilience of homes and buildings by helping people and 
communities to understand what a changing climate could mean for them and to take 
action to become resilient to climate risks.

60.  People should continue to take action to prepare for the impacts of  climate change in their 
homes and workplaces, where they are at risk. This includes greater flood protection at the 
property level, using water efficiently and acting to reduce risk from overheating.

Water efficiency

61.  The Water Resources Planning Guidelines say that reducing demand for water is a key 
priority for water companies in the next round of  Water Resource Management Plans. 
Increasing efficiency in water use will also help to cut emissions. Defra has contributed 
funding towards the Energy Savings Trust and Waterwise Green Deal guidance. This 
encourages water companies and Green Deal providers to work in partnership on joint energy 
and water efficiency projects.

62.  Water companies have a statutory duty to promote the efficient use of  water by customers.21 
This has resulted in a range of  activities such as tips for saving water, retrofit programmes, 
school education programmes and the offer of  subsidised water butts.

Water Label

The Water Label http://www.water-efficiencylabel.org.uk/ is important in helping people to 
make informed purchasing decisions and increasing the uptake of  water efficient products.  
Its visibility on bathroom fittings is likely to rise.

Love Every Drop

Anglian Water launched its ‘Love Every Drop’ campaign in 2010 to raise awareness about the 
value of  water and to change fundamentally how we all work with it and use it. It has set 10 
ambitious business goals to help achieve its vision of  putting water at the heart of  a whole new 
way of  living. The goals involve working with businesses and customers, valuing the environment 
and encouraging communities to take steps towards a sustainable future. The latest campaign, 
‘Drop 20’, is encouraging everyone to save 20 litres of  water per day. Anglian Water offers advice 
and tips to save water and is working with DIY retailers, schools and the Royal Horticultural 
Society to spread the messages.

Community and property level flood protection and 
sustainable drainage

63.  Funding for local schemes, which take steps to reduce the likelihood of  flood water entering 
people’s homes, is now available to local authorities through the Flood Defence Grant in 
Aid. The awards are made under the partnership funding approach and a local contribution 
may be necessary for a scheme to proceed. A Flood Risk Report template is also available 
to record the change in the level of  risk.22 The report was designed by the government and 
the insurance industry and provides a standard approach for presenting the flood risk to a 
property. Insurers may take the information into account when assessing the terms they offer.

64.  Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) help reduce the risk of  flooding by replicating 
natural drainage systems to slow the rate that water drains, thereby reducing the amount of  
surface runoff  entering into sewers. SuDS can have significant benefits for managing water 
resources, improving water quality through the removal of  pollutants and reducing the 
UHI effect.

65.  The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 provides for increased uptake of  SuDS in new 
developments. The government plans to implement Schedule 3 by April 2014, subject to 
parliamentary approval. Once implemented, Schedule 3 will establish a SuDS Approving 
Body (SAB) in county or unitary authorities. Subject to stipulated exemptions and also subject 
to affordability, SABs will approve drainage systems before construction begins according to 
new National SuDS Standards. They will also adopt and maintain SuDS which serve more 
than one property and are constructed to the National SuDS Standards.

Managing risks from overheating

66.  The CCRA reported that the risk of  buildings becoming too hot and uncomfortable is highly 
likely to increase. In some cases, overheating may lead to illness or death and may also affect 
economic productivity. The CCRA also found that some types of  buildings, such as those that 
are highly insulated, lightweight or have heavily glazed facades, are already vulnerable to 
summer overheating.

67.  The government’s policy for Building Regulations and the planning system in England 
influences the design and construction of  buildings. In response to the CCRA, the 
Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) published a detailed literature 
review and gap analysis about overheating in homes. This work found important gaps in 
the understanding of  overheating and in the development of  effective responses. It has 
also helped inform the continuing joint built environment sector/government response to 
overheating (see NHBC Foundation box above).

68.  Building Regulations (which govern the construction of  new buildings and the renovation of  
existing ones) are likely to continue to evolve in response to emerging risks and issues, to 
ensure buildings meet standards for health, safety, welfare, convenience and sustainability. 
Rules are already in place to ensure homes and non-domestic buildings are constructed to 
withstand the impacts of  wind and rain, subsidence and consider water scarcity. Requirements 
already exist on the insulation of  hot water pipes to address heat loss. Proposed changes to 
Part L of  the Building Regulations would strengthen the associated guidance on this. Measures 
to address heat loss in common parts of  flats would also address many cases of observed 
overheating.

69.  Overheating is being considered alongside a range of  other climate related issues as part 
of  the ongoing review of  planning practice guidance. The government has also recently 
commissioned a review of  the Building Regulations framework, including a simplification of  
local housing standards. In line with the NPPF, the aim of  the review is to ensure that new 
housing is built to appropriate sustainability standards, while reducing costs and burdens on 
house-builders and supporting economic growth.

70.  To support the mitigation of  overheating risks, Defra has commissioned the Zero Carbon Hub 
to increase industry awareness of  future overheating in new homes.

Overheating in new homes and role of Zero Carbon Hub

The Zero Carbon Hub has undertaken a programme of  work with the house building industry 
to facilitate access to information and tools that will help the industry to consider the potential 
impact of  overheating in new homes. This includes the production of  guidance which 
summarises the definitions of  overheating, the context of  future climate change, the main causes 
of  overheating in homes and advice on reducing the risk of  overheating, including links to design 
guidance and further information.

The Zero Carbon Hub continues to work closely with the Technology Strategy Board to collate 
the learning arising from the Building Performance Evaluation research and to disseminate 
accordingly. The Hub will also continue to work with a number of  universities including 
University College London, Oxford Brookes and Surrey University to gather further data and 
disseminate learning.

71.  The government has also funded recent research into future energy demand for cooling. 
The research predicted energy demand for domestic cooling could triple between 2010 and 
2050 and called for more research to develop a better understanding of  effective approaches 
to tackling overheating at the building and neighbourhood scale.23 The potential for such an 
increase in energy consumption for cooling is likely to require the government to consider how 
best to minimise the environmental impact. The Department of  Energy and Climate Change 
(DECC) intends to review how overheating is considered and assessed as a part of  the next 
SAP review in 2014-15.

72.  The government’s flagship energy efficiency scheme, the Green Deal, is taking account 
of  potential overheating risk in existing homes. Using the latest evidence, the UK Climate 
Impacts Programme (UK CIP) is co-ordinating the production of  guidance for the Green Deal 
supply chain, which is intended to raise awareness about the types of  homes that could be 
vulnerable to overheating risk in the future and how to reduce potential risk from installing 
energy efficiency measures. There are also measures available under the Green Deal for non 
domestic buildings to help reduce overheating risks, like blinds, shutters and shading devices.

London Heat Thresholds Project

Extreme hot weather is a significant risk for London. This project attempts to establish a generic, 
flexible pathway that identifies thresholds for London and its urban systems. In the first phase, 
the London Climate Change Partnership (LCCP) has produced recommendations to improve 
policy and practice relating to hot weather planning and heat risk management. This has focused 
on the social housing and care home sector, with 3 target audiences:

•  decision makers in the social housing and care home sectors

•  decision makers within London’s urban systems

•  national level decision makers who are responsible for policy, legislation and guidance 
relevant to heat risk management in the UK

The final report is available at http://climatelondon.org.uk/publications/overheating-
thresholds-report/. The LCCP will be working on the second phase of  the project this year.

73.  Retrofit programmes can combine measures which increase energy efficiency and reduce 
emissions. A good example is the RE:NEW home energy efficiency programme run by the 
Greater London Authority. Local authorities also have specific energy efficiency requirements, 
including to improve efficiency in homes.

74.  There are opportunities for promoting new products and services to help consumers adapt 
their homes, and the EA is looking to work with the DIY supply chain to do this.

Influencing consumers

B&Q has identified 3 opportunities to influence customers to buy and install products in their 
homes that promote water efficiency, resilience to flooding and overheating:

•  products: B&Q already stocks a range of  water saving products such as water butts, bark 
mulch, water saving toilets and eco click taps; overheating, cooling and flooding product 
packages are also under development

•  partnership working with Southern Water: this is delivering discounts on water saving products 
to customers having a water meter installed

•  customer information: making customers aware of  products that promote lower water usage 
has been a major activity using leaflets in partnership with water companies.

23  Significant research in this area has been undertaken through the Adaptation and Resilience to a Changing Climate programme, for example in 
the Suburban Neighbourhood Adaptation to a Changing Climate (SNACC) and Community Resilience to Extreme Weather (CREW) projects.

68.  Building Regulations (which govern the construction of  new buildings and the renovation of  
existing ones) are likely to continue to evolve in response to emerging risks and issues, to 
ensure buildings meet standards for health, safety, welfare, convenience and sustainability. 
Rules are already in place to ensure homes and non-domestic buildings are constructed to 
withstand the impacts of  wind and rain, subsidence and consider water scarcity. Requirements 
already exist on the insulation of  hot water pipes to address heat loss. Proposed changes to 
Part L of  the Building Regulations would strengthen the associated guidance on this. Measures 
to address heat loss in common parts of  flats would also address many cases of observed 
overheating.

69.  Overheating is being considered alongside a range of  other climate related issues as part 
of  the ongoing review of  planning practice guidance. The government has also recently 
commissioned a review of  the Building Regulations framework, including a simplification of  
local housing standards. In line with the NPPF, the aim of  the review is to ensure that new 
housing is built to appropriate sustainability standards, while reducing costs and burdens on 
house-builders and supporting economic growth.

70.  To support the mitigation of  overheating risks, Defra has commissioned the Zero Carbon Hub 
to increase industry awareness of  future overheating in new homes.

Overheating in new homes and role of Zero Carbon Hub

The Zero Carbon Hub has undertaken a programme of  work with the house building industry 
to facilitate access to information and tools that will help the industry to consider the potential 
impact of  overheating in new homes. This includes the production of  guidance which 
summarises the definitions of  overheating, the context of  future climate change, the main causes 
of  overheating in homes and advice on reducing the risk of  overheating, including links to design 
guidance and further information.

The Zero Carbon Hub continues to work closely with the Technology Strategy Board to collate 
the learning arising from the Building Performance Evaluation research and to disseminate 
accordingly. The Hub will also continue to work with a number of  universities including 
University College London, Oxford Brookes and Surrey University to gather further data and 
disseminate learning.

71.  The government has also funded recent research into future energy demand for cooling. 
The research predicted energy demand for domestic cooling could triple between 2010 and 
2050 and called for more research to develop a better understanding of  effective approaches 
to tackling overheating at the building and neighbourhood scale.23 The potential for such an 
increase in energy consumption for cooling is likely to require the government to consider how 
best to minimise the environmental impact. The Department of  Energy and Climate Change 
(DECC) intends to review how overheating is considered and assessed as a part of  the next 
SAP review in 2014-15.

72.  The government’s flagship energy efficiency scheme, the Green Deal, is taking account 
of  potential overheating risk in existing homes. Using the latest evidence, the UK Climate 
Impacts Programme (UK CIP) is co-ordinating the production of  guidance for the Green Deal 
supply chain, which is intended to raise awareness about the types of  homes that could be 
vulnerable to overheating risk in the future and how to reduce potential risk from installing 
energy efficiency measures. There are also measures available under the Green Deal for non 
domestic buildings to help reduce overheating risks, like blinds, shutters and shading devices.

London Heat Thresholds Project

Extreme hot weather is a significant risk for London. This project attempts to establish a generic, 
flexible pathway that identifies thresholds for London and its urban systems. In the first phase, 
the London Climate Change Partnership (LCCP) has produced recommendations to improve 
policy and practice relating to hot weather planning and heat risk management. This has focused 
on the social housing and care home sector, with 3 target audiences:

•  decision makers in the social housing and care home sectors

•  decision makers within London’s urban systems

•  national level decision makers who are responsible for policy, legislation and guidance 
relevant to heat risk management in the UK

The final report is available at http://climatelondon.org.uk/publications/overheating-
thresholds-report/. The LCCP will be working on the second phase of  the project this year.

73.  Retrofit programmes can combine measures which increase energy efficiency and reduce 
emissions. A good example is the RE:NEW home energy efficiency programme run by the 
Greater London Authority. Local authorities also have specific energy efficiency requirements, 
including to improve efficiency in homes.

74.  There are opportunities for promoting new products and services to help consumers adapt 
their homes, and the EA is looking to work with the DIY supply chain to do this.

Influencing consumers

B&Q has identified 3 opportunities to influence customers to buy and install products in their 
homes that promote water efficiency, resilience to flooding and overheating:

•  products: B&Q already stocks a range of  water saving products such as water butts, bark 
mulch, water saving toilets and eco click taps; overheating, cooling and flooding product 
packages are also under development

•  partnership working with Southern Water: this is delivering discounts on water saving products 
to customers having a water meter installed

•  customer information: making customers aware of  products that promote lower water usage 
has been a major activity using leaflets in partnership with water companies.

23  Significant research in this area has been undertaken through the Adaptation and Resilience to a Changing Climate programme, for example in 
the Suburban Neighbourhood Adaptation to a Changing Climate (SNACC) and Community Resilience to Extreme Weather (CREW) projects.

associated with coastal processes. They also present a long term policy framework to reduce 
these risks to people and the developed, historic and natural environments in a sustainable 
manner. In addition, the National Coastal Erosion Risk Mapping project (led by the EA) has

options. There will be a greater role for local decision making in the future, adding a local 
perspective to long-term investment planning.

Vision: “An infrastructure network that is resilient to today’s natural hazards and prepared for the 
future changing climate.”

78.  The National Infrastructure Plan makes clear that infrastructure networks form the backbone 
of  a modern economy and are a major determinant of  growth and productivity.24 Weather-
related damage to infrastructure can be extremely costly and can cause significant disruption 
to large numbers of  people and many sectors of  the economy. This may be exacerbated by 
climate change and therefore the government has given attention to increasing the resilience 
of  infrastructure to risks from the changing climate.25

79.  The highest order risks to infrastructure identified in the CCRA are associated with flooding. 
While the CCRA assumes that adaptation measures are not yet in place, it is important to 
note that in reality many of  these risks are already being addressed to some extent.  
This is evident in the reports produced under the Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP) by  
91 organisations, including a large number of  infrastructure operators and regulators.26  
Of  course, it is important to assess how far these existing activities are sufficient to address 
the risks and to encourage further action.

80.  The CCRA highlights power generation, energy supply, strategic transport networks and 
sewers as being at significant risk of  increased flooding. Loss or disruption of  any of  these 
services would have consequences for the effective functioning of  organisations right across 
the country. For example, loss of  power could also cause many other effects, including loss of  
telecommunications and difficulties with fuel supplies.

81.  Another major risk identified in the CCRA is a significant potential decrease in the water 
available for public supply. This could affect the majority of  the population.

82.  Alongside the evidence from the CCRA, the government’s ‘Climate Resilient Infrastructure’ 
report outlines the main issues for the transport, energy, water and Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) sectors, and covers 3 main areas:

 • embedding climate risks in regulatory frameworks

 • improving understanding of  the risk of  cascade failures

 •  promoting the strength of  existing links between the National Adaptation Programme and 
work to improve the resilience of  the UK’s most important infrastructure to current natural 
hazards, such as Sector Resilience Plans (SRPs), so as to encourage proportionate levels 
of  investment in the UK’s infrastructure.27

83.  Sector Resilience Plans set out the resilience of  the UK’s important infrastructure to the 
relevant risks identified in the National Risk Assessment.28 Produced annually, they include a 
programme of  measures to improve resilience where needed. Individual plans are classified, 
but the Cabinet Office produces a summary Sector Resilience Plan for Critical Infrastructure. 
The 2010 SRPs focused on the resilience of  the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure to 
flooding. The 2011 SRPs extended the scope to allow assessment of  other natural hazards 
and/or less critical assets. The 2012 SRPs extended the scope to allow assessment of  the 
resilience of  the sectors’ most important infrastructure to all risks (threats and hazards).

84.  As recommended in the Climate Resilient Infrastructure Report, the Adaptation Sub 
Committee of  the Committee of  Climate Change is looking at preparedness for climate 
change in the water, transport and energy sectors between 2012 and 2014.

85.  This chapter brings together action to address the risks in the 3 sectors analysed by the 
CCRA: water, transport and energy. Resilient ICT infrastructure is pivotal to the operation of  
these sectors to best manage any ICT disruptions that could impact on the productivity and 
effectiveness of  these sectors. Further consideration needs to be given to such disruption, 
along with further evidence to better understand the issues.

86.  In December 2012, the government published an update to the 2011 National Infrastructure 
Plan’s detailed pipeline of  infrastructure investment. It identified over 550 new projects valued 
at over £310 billion to 2015 and beyond. This is an increase of  over £45 billion in real terms, 
compared to the value estimated in 2011.29 Ensuring that infrastructure is resilient to climate 
change impacts will support this growth and support competitiveness over the longer term. 
The actions in this programme contribute towards that effort.

Focus area 1: Infrastructure asset management

Objective 7: To ensure infrastructure is located, planned, designed and maintained to be 
resilient to climate change, including increasingly extreme weather events.

87.  The decisions infrastructure owners and operators, regulators and the government make over 
the next few years must be informed by an understanding of  climate risks. If  they are not, the 
country may be locked into infrastructure development pathways that do not provide adequate 
protection against future climate impacts and which are detrimental to the economy. There are 
economic benefits to be gained by adapting infrastructure to a changing climate, as long as 
decisions are taken at the right time.

Energy

88.  The energy sector is well aware of  the risks of  flooding and has already taken action in response 
to the Pitt Review recommendations.30 In addition, energy operators are already addressing 
other major risks such as heat related damage or disruption, losses to energy transmission 
efficiency capacity and possible restrictions in water abstraction for energy generation. Action is 
underway to share best practice and illustrate effective adaptation amongst network providers 
and energy generators, including applicants for development consent.

89.  For transmitters and distributors, the Energy Networks Association led a working group to 
oversee the response to the Pitt Review’s recommendations to improve sub-station resilience. 
The group has recently re-formed to update important industry guidance around surface 
water flooding and dam inundation.31

90.  For energy generators, reports produced under the ARP set out work that is underway to 
ensure that generating plants are resilient. Typical preparatory actions include flood modelling 
and monitoring and local resilience planning to manage extreme weather events. Flood 
risk, in particular, is assessed during project planning and factored into the design of  new 
installations as power station assets are retired and replaced. Energy generators mitigate 
hazards arising from extreme weather through established corporate risk management 
procedures. The sector’s resilience is also increased by the combination of  headroom 
in generating plant capacity, geographical diversity of  plant and diversity in generating 
technology.

91.  Those applying for consent to develop energy infrastructure are required to take the need to 
adapt into account, in line with the principles set out in the Energy National Policy  
Statements, designated by the Secretary of  State for Energy and Climate Change in July 
2011.32 The National Policy Statements (NPSs) set out the framework for consenting 
applications for major energy infrastructure under the Planning Act 2008.

Energy National Policy Statements

Government will review whether the Energy NPSs accurately reflect emerging climate adaptation 
policy. This will be part of  future reviews to ensure that climate resilience is being accounted 
for in applications for new infrastructure and in determining applications for new energy 
infrastructure.

92.  Over the coming decades, the UK’s energy system faces a number of  challenges including 
the need to decarbonise, the fact that around a fifth of  our 2011 generating capacity has to 
close over this decade and declining domestic fossil fuel production in the context of  rising 
energy demand.

93.  The government’s Electricity Market Reform programme (EMR) will ensure that electricity 
supplies are secure and low carbon. One of  the main elements of  EMR is the implementation 
of  a Capacity Market. If  initiated, it would help adapt the overall energy system to both 
intermittent sources of  generation and future weather conditions, for example when demand 
is high and wind generation is low. If  initiated, both generation and non-generation providers 
of  capacity would receive a predictable revenue stream for providing reliable capacity and 
would face financial penalties if  they failed to do so.

94.  If  the Capacity Market is initiated, the decision on the amount of  capacity put in place will 
not only need to take into account the decarbonisation of  the system, but also the changing 
nature of  demand brought about by the changing climate. The CCRA found that milder 
winters may lead to reduced energy demand for domestic heating with potentially very large 
economic and social benefits. Higher summer temperatures may result in a rise in energy 
demand for cooling.

would face financial penalties if  they failed to do so.

94.  If  the Capacity Market is initiated, the decision on the amount of  capacity put in place will 
not only need to take into account the decarbonisation of  the system, but also the changing 
nature of  demand brought about by the changing climate. The CCRA found that milder 
winters may lead to reduced energy demand for domestic heating with potentially very large 
economic and social benefits. Higher summer temperatures may result in a rise in energy 
demand for cooling.

95.  The Department for Transport (DfT) is working with industry to increase climate resilience in the 
planning and design of transport infrastructure. DfT will continue to build adaptation into its major 
plans and strategies, thereby ensuring that project management and appraisals take the need to 
adapt into account, to ensure sustainable economic growth. Particular examples include:

 • Road Strategies due for publication in 2013

 •  Ports NPSs (2012) and future Aviation and National Networks NPSs

 •  2013 Aviation Policy Framework which balances the costs and benefits of  aviation, 
including the need for climate change adaptation

 •  Network Rail Strategic Business Plan for 2014-19 (published January 2013) which includes 
the need to future proof  critical infrastructure against the impacts of  changing weather

Network Rail

Network Rail has recognised the importance of  embedding climate change adaptation into its 
operations and management:

• allocating funds to protecting tracks and bridges against floods and heat waves

•  delivering analysis of  impacts from projected climate change, both internally and within the 
Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) funded Tomorrow’s Railway and Climate Change 
Adaptation (TRaCCA) research programme

•  increasing adaptive capacity to provide a strong and informed base for effective climate 
change adaptation decision making

•  supporting the new phase of  the TRaCCA research programme to deliver step changes in the 
knowledge of  railway asset vulnerabilities and system inter-dependencies by 2015

•  developing decision support tools to drive an increase in climate change resilience of  the GB 
railway industry

High Speed 2

DfT is the sponsor for the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail route and has required HS2 Ltd to incorporate

of resilience so that it is not a significant burden in relation to the asset value of around £108 
billion. This programme for resilience and integrity of assets and services will bring benefits to 
users and help avoid the economic costs associated with weather and climate impacts.

Highways Agency

The HA is using its Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Framework to incorporate climate 
change into its business through 6 major activities:

Water

97.  The CCRA identified water shortages, water supply-demand deficits and combined sewer 
overflow spill frequency as the most urgent risks from climate change. Changing rainfall patterns 
need to be considered alongside ageing water supply and waste water infrastructure assets, 
drivers of change in water demand such as population growth and increased water use.

98.  The government has published a Strategic Policy Statement and Social and Environmental 
Guidance to Ofwat. These documents will inform the price review process and reflect the 
government’s policy objectives as set out in the Natural Environment White Paper and the 
Water White Paper. The Water White Paper sets out more detail about the government’s 
expectations of  how water companies should consider climate risks. In addition, recent Water 
Resource Management Plan (WRMP) guidance provides advice about how water companies 
can make practical use of  the latest climate projections. Water Companies will deliver their 
next WRMPs in 2014.

99.  The industry is proactive and Water UK has a Climate Change Network that shares industry 
approaches to dealing with climate change and raises the profile of  issues within the UK and 
throughout Europe. The group organises vital activity to support the NAP and ensures that 
future business and investment plans address climate resilience.

Water companies

The reports produced by water companies in the first round of  the Adaptation Reporting Power 
(ARP) show that the industry is implementing climate change adaptation plans and undertaking 
wider activity such as drought planning and management through the Asset Management Plan 
process:

•  Severn Trent and Anglian Water are using the UKCP09 Weather Generator tool with Anglian 
Water also using the UKCP09 Threshold Detector tool to assess climate change risks

•  Wessex Water is reviewing design standards for sewerage to account for future increases in 
peak flows using UKCP09


 

100.  In relation to water quality, the CCRA highlighted that an increase in winter precipitation could 
lead to potential increases in Combined Sewer Outflow (CSO) spill frequency and volumes. 
Without intervention, this could lead to adverse effects on water quality.

101.  Water companies are addressing this risk by gaining a better understanding of  drainage and 
sewerage network performance, so that climate vulnerabilities can be identified and action 
taken to manage the risks. Monitoring the level of  spills helps to better understand how 
drainage systems are working and to identify any deterioration in performance, before it has 
an impact on the environment. This also provides greater transparency to customers and 
communities about the performance of  these systems. Early cost-effective measures can 
then be put in place to reduce spills or remedy the impacts. In addition, a number of  water 
companies are already encouraging customers to play their part in preventing sewer misuse 
to help improve sewerage and drainage performance.

102.  One of  the benefits of  surface water management is the relief  of  pressure on existing sub-
surface drainage networks. The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 includes a duty to 
co-operate and ahead of  the next price review, water companies are partnering with Lead 
Local Flood Authorities to produce area drainage plans. LLFAs that have identified areas of  
significant flood risk are required to produce a set of  surface water flood maps by the end of  
2013 in collaboration with water companies.

short and long term sustainability obligations. DfT will ensure ongoing action by incorporating 
adaptation into its funding control periods and High Level Output Specifications.33

108.  Aviation is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) which considers climate impacts 
in its business continuity planning and risk management. To encourage greater emphasis

including those resulting from climate change. Ofwat is also working with the EA and industry 
to embed resilience planning principles.

110.  Defra’s Strategic Policy Statement and Social and Environmental Guidance to Ofwat sets 
out the principles for adaptation in the regulatory framework and how regulatory policies 
are helping to remove barriers to action. The Price Review (PR14) for the water and 
sewerage industry will provide the framework within which water companies will invest in the 
infrastructure measures (both operational and capital) needed to continue to address supply-
demand deficits. Ofwat has also published a consultation document on the methodology for 
the next price review. The methodology encourages a more outcome-focused approach for 
capital and operational expenditure and targeted incentives for water trading and 
sustainable abstraction.

Focus area 3: Local infrastructure

Objective 9: To better understand the particular vulnerabilities facing local infrastructure 
from extreme weather and long term climate change to determine actions to address 
the risks.

112.  Local transport infrastructure includes local road and rail networks, trams and underground 
rail. Local roads comprise 98% of  England’s highways, providing vital transport connections 
with other transport modes. However, they were not part of  the analysis in the CCRA so it is 
important to address this gap and develop an understanding of  the potential climate risks to 
local roads.

113.  There are potential economic consequences from local transport failure with knock-
on implications for other sectors. To maintain operations and thereby reduce costs and 
disruption, adaptation at this level is essential. Climate change is already highlighted in the 
UK Roads Liaison Group’s (UK RLG) ‘Code of  Practice for Well Maintained Highways’.34 
Future updates of  other codes for management of  highway assets will include more detailed 
references to climate change adaptation and mitigation.

114.  The Association of  Directors of  Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (ADEPT) is 
addressing this knowledge gap. It is working with DfT, local road organisations such as the 
UK Roads Liaison Group, Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP) and climate 
groups like Climate UK, through a programme of: 

 • communications to enhance knowledge sharing and best practice

 • reviews and updates to guidance like the HMEP asset management toolkits

 •  building capacity of  relevant local council groups and major Defra partners/interested 
parties

115.  The LGA’s Climate Local initiative offers councils with responsibility for highways a framework 
under which they can identify how their local transport infrastructure will be vulnerable to 
a changing climate. It sets out options to help them address risks along with supporting 
resources.

Transport for London (TfL)

TfL is working to improve its resilience to extreme weather and climate change. New 
infrastructure project plans (eg Northern Line extension) will include adaptation and 
requirements to address extreme weather are incorporated in major standards and asset 
management plans. London Underground reviews flood risk and contingency plans, amending 
standards and processes as necessary. In addition, TfL has identified stations that are subject 
to current flooding with low frequency or consequence and have plans to reinstate services 
promptly and to have required safety standards following a flood.

Focus area 4: Infrastructure interdependencies and 
climate risk

Objective 10: To develop understanding and promote expertise in managing 
interconnected and interdependent services, to minimise the risks of cascade failures 
which could be exacerbated by climate change and identify how systems thinking can 
support this objective.

116.  The CCRA focused on specific infrastructure sectors in isolation and did not take into account 
the interdependencies between them. We need to develop our understanding of  the interplay 
of  impacts between different sectors. The development of  skills in systems thinking is likely to 
be crucial to the delivery of  this objective.

117.  Cascade failure impacts occur when failure in one area of  infrastructure leads to failures in a 
number of  other areas. For example, in 2009 extreme flooding caused the Northside highway 
bridge collapse in Workington, leading to communities losing power and services.

118.  To ensure that vulnerabilities in one sector do not threaten the resilience of  others, it is 
important for organisations to share data and collaborate across networks. Priority areas for 
the NAP are:

 • the interdependencies between the water and energy sectors

 •  understanding climate risks to ICT service delivery and thereby their interdependencies

119.  A number of  pieces of  work are underway to help improve understanding of  
interdependencies. Infrastructure UK (IUK) is sponsoring research by the University of  
Bristol and UCL to develop an ‘Interdependencies Planning and Management Framework’. 
This will help the identification and understanding of  cross sectoral interdependencies in 
new infrastructure projects so that risks can be managed and opportunities identified. IUK, 
in conjunction with Engineering the Future, is also preparing an update on its ‘Infrastructure 
Policy Timelines’ document which aims to identify interdependencies at a policy level.

114.  The Association of  Directors of  Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (ADEPT) is 
addressing this knowledge gap. It is working with DfT, local road organisations such as the 
UK Roads Liaison Group, Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP) and climate 
groups like Climate UK, through a programme of: 

 • communications to enhance knowledge sharing and best practice

 • reviews and updates to guidance like the HMEP asset management toolkits

 •  building capacity of  relevant local council groups and major Defra partners/interested 
parties

115.  The LGA’s Climate Local initiative offers councils with responsibility for highways a framework 
under which they can identify how their local transport infrastructure will be vulnerable to 
a changing climate. It sets out options to help them address risks along with supporting 
resources.

Transport for London (TfL)

TfL is working to improve its resilience to extreme weather and climate change. New 
infrastructure project plans (eg Northern Line extension) will include adaptation and 
requirements to address extreme weather are incorporated in major standards and asset 
management plans. London Underground reviews flood risk and contingency plans, amending 
standards and processes as necessary. In addition, TfL has identified stations that are subject 
to current flooding with low frequency or consequence and have plans to reinstate services 
promptly and to have required safety standards following a flood.

Focus area 4: Infrastructure interdependencies and 
climate risk

Objective 10: To develop understanding and promote expertise in managing 
interconnected and interdependent services, to minimise the risks of cascade failures 
which could be exacerbated by climate change and identify how systems thinking can 
support this objective.

116.  The CCRA focused on specific infrastructure sectors in isolation and did not take into account 
the interdependencies between them. We need to develop our understanding of  the interplay 
of  impacts between different sectors. The development of  skills in systems thinking is likely to 
be crucial to the delivery of  this objective.

117.  Cascade failure impacts occur when failure in one area of  infrastructure leads to failures in a 
number of  other areas. For example, in 2009 extreme flooding caused the Northside highway 
bridge collapse in Workington, leading to communities losing power and services.

118.  To ensure that vulnerabilities in one sector do not threaten the resilience of  others, it is 
important for organisations to share data and collaborate across networks. Priority areas for 
the NAP are:

 • the interdependencies between the water and energy sectors

 •  understanding climate risks to ICT service delivery and thereby their interdependencies 
with other sectors

 •  ensuring that infrastructure design and planning addresses environmental impacts in a 
changing climate, through processes such as Environmental Impact Assessment.

119.  A number of  pieces of  work are underway to help improve understanding of  
interdependencies. Infrastructure UK (IUK) is sponsoring research by the University of  
Bristol and UCL to develop an ‘Interdependencies Planning and Management Framework’. 
This will help the identification and understanding of  cross sectoral interdependencies in 
new infrastructure projects so that risks can be managed and opportunities identified. IUK,

Energy interdependencies

The Economics of  Climate Resilience Project made specific recommendations around energy 
interdependencies. They include:

•  building adaptive capacity by enhancing knowledge and understanding of  interdependencies 
of  the sector and adjacent sectors

•  encouraging system-wide modelling and assessment to explore different climate risk and 
adaptation scenarios

•  assessing the degree to which resilience is affected as technology develops in other  
sectors like ICT

Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium

The Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC), which is funded by a £4.7 million 
grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC), is developing 
evidence that will help infrastructure operators and policy makers to address interdependent 
infrastructure failure risks by:

•  developing a national risk model to assess the impacts of  climate-related infrastructure 
network failures on people and the economy

•  using the framework to identify vulnerabilities under different scenarios and to prioritise 
strategies to enhance network resilience

Vision: “A health service, a public health and social care system which are resilient and adapted 
to a changing climate.”

Vision: “Communities and individuals, including the most vulnerable, are better prepared to cope 
with severe weather events and other impacts of  climate change.”

Vision: “Emergency services and local resilience capability take account of  and are resilient to, 
a changing climate.”

120.  The health sector, generally speaking, sees climate change as one of  the biggest global 
public health threats this century.35 There are risks to the health of  the UK population, 
particularly to the most vulnerable, as well as to the effective delivery of  public health, the 
National Health Service (NHS) and social care services.36 There may be some welcome 
benefits, such as warmer winters resulting in fewer winter deaths but these are likely to be 
outweighed by a range of  negative effects. Climate change is also likely to have implications 
for the emergency services and there is an important role for local responders and 
communities to play in preparing for and building resilience to potential impacts.

121.  The CCRA identified the health risks from increased summer temperatures and overheating 
in buildings as the most significant, along with the health impacts from floods. Flooding can 
affect mental health and wellbeing, have an impact on healthcare facilities including hospitals 
and put vulnerable people at significant risk. The CCRA also identified an urgent need to 
better understand the potential risk from increased exposure to sunlight and ultra-violet 
radiation (UV). Our understanding of  the severity of  these risks has been reinforced through 
discussions with the health and social care sector and by the publication of  the Department of  
Health (DH)/Health Protection Agency (HPA) Report ‘Health Effects of  Climate Change in the 
UK 2012’.37

122.  Extreme weather events such as droughts, wildfires and the continued occurrence of  sudden 
cold weather snaps can also pose a risk to people’s health. So can the increased exposure 
to ground-level ozone and other air pollutants, including the areas below. Actions to address 
these issues are included in the Register of  Actions at the end of  this Report:

 • aeroallergens such as pollen, marine and freshwater pathogens

 • food and vector-borne diseases

 • chemical and biological contamination in the indoor environment (such as mould)

 • food quality and security

123.  The impacts from extreme weather and climate change will vary by location and place 
burdens on different parts of  society, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities. One 
example is that older people are more vulnerable to extreme heat and cold. Another example 
of  variability is that urban areas are likely to be particularly affected by high temperatures due 
to the UHI effect (see Chapter 2).

124.  Responsibility for addressing many of  the health risks rests with the local health and social 
care system and there are significant opportunities to ensure that a joined-up approach is 
taken for the short and long-term by a wide range of  local partners. National policy is driven 
by DH, working across the government along with partners such as NHS England, Public 
Health England (PHE) and the Sustainable Development Unit for the NHS, public health and 
social care system (SDU). The co-ordinated actions of  emergency services and communities 
will also play an important role in preparing for, responding to and recovering from extreme 
weather events as they are expected to increase in severity as a result of  climate change.

125.  Many of  the solutions, particularly for the long-term, will require action beyond the health 
sector. This chapter should therefore be read in conjunction with Chapter 2 (action to prevent 
overheating and flooding in the built environment, role of  spatial planning, availability of  flood 
insurance), Chapter 3 (interdependencies of  health facilities with other critical infrastructure 
such as water and energy) and Chapter 6 (on green infrastructure).

126.  Action to adapt to and mitigate climate change can often deliver wider benefits for health 
and wellbeing and also cut costs. However it is important to note that some interventions 
may have inadvertent negative health impacts. These should be considered when taking 
action. Examples include flood risk management creating habitats for disease vectors and 
increasingly air-tight buildings causing mould growth and the accumulation of  harmful gases.

Focus area 1: Climate resilience in the health and 
social care system 

Objective 11: To reduce the risk of death and illness associated with severe weather 
events and climate change and increase preparedness and resilience to the impacts on 
public health.

Objective 12: To promote climate resilience within the NHS, public health and social care 
system to ensure continuity of services and resilient assets/estates including the ability 
to deal with the increased demand for services associated with severe weather events.

National and local frameworks for managing public  
health risks

127.  An important framework for managing health risks to the local population is defined by the 
Health and Social Care Act 2012, which places an important focus on local planning and 
decision-making, led by Directors of  Public Health. The mechanisms provided for setting 
and delivering local health priorities, in particular the Joint Strategic Needs Assessments 
(JSNAs) and subsequent strategies produced by health and wellbeing boards, offer a route 
to address climate risks and extreme weather events. The boards should consider these risks 
and possible impacts to inform their jointly-agreed local priorities. Both JSNAs and Health and 
Wellbeing Strategies will inform commissioning across the local health and care system.

128.  The Public Health Outcomes Framework also includes the consideration of  climate resilience 
within the Sustainable Development Management Plans (SDMPs) indicator, supported by 
PHE and the SDU.38 Dedicated SDU Adaptation Guidance is available to support adaptation 
work within health sector organisations and the SDU will continue to promote adaptation 
action across the NHS as part of  Board level SDMPs.39 A health adaptation tool is being 
piloted and tested by the EA’s Climate Ready support service. A range of  other tools are 
available, for example, to support adapted buildings for older people.40 The SDU with support 
from NHS England and PHE will report to the government on progress under the Adaptation 
Reporting Power.

A climate resilient NHS, public health and social care service

129.  The Health and Social Care Act 2012 and the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 require the NHS 
and NHS-funded care providers to ensure that they manage risks to the continuity of  health 
and social care service provision, including from severe weather events and the associated 
increased demand.41

130.  Local Health Resilience Partnerships (LHRPs) have been established across England to 
provide a strategic forum for joint planning and preparedness for emergencies for the health 
system. They support the health sector’s contribution (including the private and voluntary 
sector where appropriate) to multi-agency planning and preparation for response through 
Local Resilience Forums (LRFs).

131.  DH will work with NHS England and partners such as PHE, SDU and the EA to plan and 
maintain healthcare facilities that are resilient to flooding and extreme temperatures. They 
will also explore the potential of  the Strategic Health Asset Planning Evaluation toolkit in 
achieving this. DH will work with the Information Centre for Health and Social Care and NHS 
Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) and business continuity teams 
to develop climate resilience reporting in national NHS estates and business continuity 
information frameworks.

Extreme temperatures

132.  Research indicates that the 2003 European summer heatwave could become a normal event 
by the 2040s.42 Heat-related deaths are projected to increase significantly in future decades, 
with older people, particularly those over 75, most vulnerable to extreme heat. Cold-related 
deaths are projected to decline, but cold-snaps will still occur, with associated health impacts.

133.  DH/PHE have in place Heatwave and Cold Weather Plans for England, both of  which are 
reviewed annually. These will be further reviewed to ensure they reach beyond the immediate 
health sector and help safeguard the most vulnerable people. This approach reflects the 
findings of  the ‘Economics of  Climate Resilience’ (ECR) report. That report found that alert 
systems, preparedness, communication, coordination across the health and social care 
service, and targeted support to the most vulnerable communities are likely to be the most 
effective actions to address heat risks to public health. PHE will explore the relevance of  
these plans to other extreme weather events using the so-called ‘all hazards approach’ where 
the same tried and tested system is used to respond to all types of  hazard. DH will also keep 
under review its national best practice guidance for the design, engineering and operation of  
healthcare facilities, particularly in relation to the extreme temperature and flood resilience of  
NHS estates and assets.

Heatwave Plan for England

Around 2,000 premature deaths across the UK were attributed to the 2003 heatwave. The 
Heatwave Plan for England has been in operation since 2004. By 2014 the Plan will have an 
improved reach to local authorities and include advice on action beyond the health sector, for 
example, on the role of  blue and green infrastructure, housing design and transport in reducing 
health risks associated with overheating and air pollution during heatwaves. Individuals, groups 
and communities most susceptible to heat impacts will also be actively targeted.  
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heatwave-plan-for-england-2013

Flooding
134.  More than 5 million properties are at risk of  flooding in England representing almost 1 in 6 

homes. Flood events can have a direct effect on our health through injuries caused by falling 
into fast-flowing water, from hidden dangers under the water, such as missing manhole covers, 
or at worst drowning. Indirect effects from flooding include electrocution, carbon monoxide 
poisoning from the use of  generators and other fuel-powered equipment brought indoors 
to dry out buildings, damage to health infrastructure, water and electrical supplies and the 
displacement of  people and disruption to their lives. 

135.  Health impacts often continue beyond the immediate flood event, during the recovery and 
clean up stages and may persist for months or years. The impact on a person’s mental health 
and wellbeing can be particularly significant. This makes the availability of  psychosocial 
support through formal and informal networks especially important, an area explored further 
in Focus Area 3 of  this chapter. The ECR report also highlighted particularly effective actions 
as being the provision of  social support (such as communities, voluntary groups, shared 
learning), information and practical support for residents to return to their homes.

136. Some important ways to manage the impacts from flooding on people’s health include:

 •  ‘NHS Emergency Planning Guidance’ (2005) and ‘NHS Emergency Planning Guidance on 
planning the psychosocial and mental health care of  people affected by major accidents 
and disasters (2009)’. These documents set out the role of  the NHS in addressing health 
risks from flooding including risks to mental wellbeing

 •  PHE’s information and guidance notes on the health impacts of  flooding (including mental 
health and wellbeing) for health practitioners, responders and the public43

 •  Directors of  Public Health play an important role in determining and overseeing actions to 
address the health risks of  flooding according to local need

 •  Defra’s National Flood Emergency Framework for England will integrate the health impacts 
from flooding by end 2013

Heatwave Plan for England

Around 2,000 premature deaths across the UK were attributed to the 2003 heatwave. The 
Heatwave Plan for England has been in operation since 2004. By 2014 the Plan will have an 
improved reach to local authorities and include advice on action beyond the health sector, for 
example, on the role of  blue and green infrastructure, housing design and transport in reducing 
health risks associated with overheating and air pollution during heatwaves. Individuals, groups 
and communities most susceptible to heat impacts will also be actively targeted.  
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heatwave-plan-for-england-2013

Flooding
134.  More than 5 million properties are at risk of  flooding in England representing almost 1 in 6 

homes. Flood events can have a direct effect on our health through injuries caused by falling 
into fast-flowing water, from hidden dangers under the water, such as missing manhole covers, 
or at worst drowning. Indirect effects from flooding include electrocution, carbon monoxide 
poisoning from the use of  generators and other fuel-powered equipment brought indoors 
to dry out buildings, damage to health infrastructure, water and electrical supplies and the 
displacement of  people and disruption to their lives. 

135.  Health impacts often continue beyond the immediate flood event, during the recovery and 
clean up stages and may persist for months or years. The impact on a person’s mental health 
and wellbeing can be particularly significant. This makes the availability of  psychosocial

Focus area 2: Vulnerable groups

Objective 13: To minimise the impacts of climate change on vulnerable groups in society 
by strengthening their resilience to better prepare for, respond to and recover from future 
climate risk.

137.  There is a growing appreciation of  how the impacts from climate change and extreme 
weather events could disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in society, such as older 
people, low income groups and those with multiple health problems.44 The particular effects 
will be highly dependent on local circumstances. Effective solutions on how to support 
vulnerable groups should therefore be found and led by the local community or local council, 
with voluntary groups playing an important role. (See also the ECR report).

138.  Identifying, assessing and addressing vulnerability within sub-sections of  society is likely 
to present complex and difficult situations for local responders, particularly in responding 
to emergencies where they need to focus on people with the greatest needs. The Cabinet 
Office’s Civil Contingencies Secretariat has produced guidance for emergency planners and 
responders.45 Its primary focus is on identifying and building relationships with organisations 
that know about or are responsible for vulnerable people, so that appropriate response 

mechanisms can be agreed before an emergency arises. DH also seeks to ensure equity 
within its health policies with PHE having a role in providing technical support, guidance and 
materials and public health intelligence.

139.  There will continue to be a need for relevant partners to help vulnerable groups to prepare for 
and recover from events in the short and long term. Examples of  projects aiming to achieve 
this include the Big Lottery Fund’s ‘Communities Living Sustainably Initiative’ that supports 
community-level responses to climate change and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation/EA 
‘ClimateJust’ project.

ClimateJust

ClimateJust is a joint initiative of  the EA and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation to develop a set 
of  web-based resources for practitioners to assist them in delivering socially just responses 
to climate change. It will help practitioners to develop adaptation responses that take account 
of  social vulnerability and disadvantage caused by climate impacts. It will support a range of  
organisations with a role in responding to the potential health and wellbeing impacts of  climate 
change including local authorities, health and social care providers, housing organisations, 
voluntary and community organisations.

140.  The EA’s Climate Ready programme will continue to support the LGA’s Climate Local initiative, 
in particular looking at how to understand how best to target vulnerable groups. The Climate 
Ready programme will also provide adaptation advice and signpost tools and information 
to a wide range of  civil society organisations such as charities and other voluntary groups, 
working closely with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) to build on its 
‘Vulnerable people and climate change’ programme.

Actions to address priority risks

EA Climate Ready will support the LGA’s Climate Local portal to 
signpost a selection of  important tools which help councils take action


EA

EA Climate Ready will continue to share information and promote 
understanding of  the risks to different vulnerable groups, specifically 
including:

•  supporting local councils through the dissemination of  tools and 
guidance on how to map vulnerable groups and best work with 
communities

•  supporting and disseminating learning about the gaps and barriers 
which exist for effective working with voluntary organisations on 
climate resilience, using networks through the NCVO

Objective 14: To promote and strengthen community resilience to severe weather related 
events linked to climate change (preparation, response and recovery), and the climate 
resilience of the emergency services and other Category 1 and 2 Responders of the Local 
Resilience Forums (LRFs).

141.  At the national level, community and corporate resilience is a workstream within the UK 
National Resilience Capabilities Programme. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat in the 
Cabinet Office works in partnership across the government, particularly with DCLG to support 
community resilience including the provision of  resources, community toolkits and advice.46 
Various initiatives are in place to co-ordinate preparedness for severe weather events 
including ‘Get Ready for Winter’ and the Natural Hazards Partnership.47, 48 

Community resilience and the impacts of climate change

In December 2012 Defra awarded grants to 9 Local Resilience Forums to fund projects that 
will build and strengthen community resilience to the potential impacts of  climate change. The 
following applicants were successful on behalf  of  their LRF: Blackburn with Darwen Borough 
Council; Devon and Cornwall Police; Greater London Authority; Hampshire Fire and Rescue 
Service; Lake District National Park Authority; Lincolnshire County Council; Liverpool City 
Council; Norfolk Constabulary; and North Somerset District Council.

Projects included:

•  A series of  children’s books which raise awareness about community resilience and the 
impacts of  climate change; these are available to read online and have been distributed to all 
Hampshire schools and libraries

•  New dedicated Community Resilience web portals and a common framework to help 
communities prepare for the impacts of  climate change

•  A new model for climate change adaptation and community resilience planning in a rural setting

The outcomes and best practice identified during the projects have been shared at regional LRF 
workshops and through the wider LRF network.

www.cumbriaaction.org.uk

142.  The government will continue to promote community resilience to both current and future 
severe weather events, working through a Cabinet Office-chaired cross-government 
Community Resilience Working Group. Its purpose is to promote collaborative, co-ordinated 
approaches that support communities and local responders. Cabinet Office has also 
established a Community Resilience Knowledge Hub hosted by the Emergency Planning 
College, where individuals and communities can post their own experiences. This is 
supplemented by learning materials to support local community action, along with advice on 
potential sources of  funding and signposting to other information.

Emergency services

143.  At the national level, the government has an ongoing programme of  training and exercises 
involving the emergency services and other local responders, to ensure and improve 
capability to respond to and recover from emergencies. These roles were tested during 
Exercise Watermark in 2011. This exercise set out to rigorously test arrangements across 
England to respond to severe, wide area flooding, including a tidal surge along the East 
Coast of  England. Many of  the lessons learnt from Watermark emphasised the importance 
of  a planned and organised response from individuals and communities. This was further 
demonstrated during the flood events of  2012.

144.  Individual emergency services are looking carefully at the risks and setting out their local 
responses. The Chief  Fire Officers’ Association (CFOA) have agreed to produce a voluntary 
report under the Adaptation Reporting Power setting out the risks from future weather 
conditions to their members’ operations across England as well as how they will respond to 
them. The Association of  Ambulance Chief  Executives (AACE) is collating information on 
the extent of  adaptation coverage within those SDMPs undertaken by the NHS Ambulance 
Trusts across England.

Local resilience and recovery

145.  Planning the recovery of  communities following any major emergency is the responsibility 
of  the relevant council. They will be supported by other local partners through the 38 Local 
Resilience Forums (LRFs) across England. The LRFs play a crucial role in supporting 
local communities and businesses in managing local risks. Duties set out under the Civil 
Contingencies Act 2004, including the requirement to maintain and publish a Community Risk 
Register, already provide a mechanism to drive co-ordinated action in response to the risk of  
severe weather events, both now and for events that are likely to increase over time.

146.  Many LRFs and councils have also identified that local needs can be met most effectively 
by working with their communities to increase their resilience against a range of  natural 
emergencies. From flood and snow wardens to broader community champions, there are 
many examples of  the commitment of  local people investing their time and knowledge to 
make themselves and their communities more resilient.

Resilience Forums (LRFs) across England. The LRFs play a crucial role in supporting 
local communities and businesses in managing local risks. Duties set out under the Civil

147.  The recovery phase following a severe weather event is particularly important for minimising 
some of  the significant health risks identified earlier in this chapter such as the mental 
health and wellbeing impacts associated with flooding. Recovery is best achieved when the 
process starts from the moment the emergency begins, running in tandem with the response. 
Following an emergency, councils will usually co-ordinate the multi-agency recovery process. 
They will chair and provide the secretariat for the Recovery Co-ordinating Group, with support 
from the full range of  multi-agency partners including the private and voluntary sectors 
and the wider community, all of  whom play crucial roles.49 In undertaking this, councils are 
responsible for providing a wide range of  support.50 This includes evacuation and shelter and 
humanitarian assistance.51 The Civil Contingencies Secretariat provides advice and guidance 
to support councils through the National Recovery Guidance.52

Communities

148.  Communities and individuals can help to build their own resilience to severe weather events. 
LRFs, by developing their own resilience plans, encourage communities to get involved in 
work in line with the local risk profile.

149.  The voluntary sector provides an extensive and diverse range of  operational and support 
skills and services to statutory responders. This may take the form of  supporting the 
emergency services during severe weather events with private off-road vehicles and 
boats, helping with recovery, providing financial advice and psycho-social support (such 
as comforting, befriending, listening, help-lines, support networks, drop-in centres, advice, 
counselling, spiritual support and group therapy).

150.  Further examples include the establishment of various local flood groups around the country, 
many of which work under the umbrella of the National Flood Forum. In response to local needs, 
they work closely with the emergency services, LRFs, councils and bodies such as the EA.

Flood Resilience Community Pathfinder scheme

Defra launched a grant scheme to support community-led projects to improve resilience to 
flooding in December 2012. Following a competition, schemes are being funded in: Blackburn; 
Buckinghamshire; Calderdale; Cornwall; Devon; Liverpool; Northamptonshire; Rochdale; Slough; 
Southampton; Swindon; Warwickshire; and West Sussex. Defra has invested over £4 million and 
councils are contributing approximately £1.2 million, up to 2015.

The aim of  the scheme is to fund projects that would enable local communities to develop local 
solutions that:

•  enhance flood risk management and preparedness to improve the community’s overall 
resilience

•  demonstrably improve the community’s financial resilience in relation to flooding

•  deliver sustained improvements which have the potential to be applied in other areas

Good evidence exists on what action can be taken both at an individual property-level (eg 
property-level protection, resilient repairs) and at a larger scheme level (eg building and 
maintaining flood defences). The intention of  the scheme is to learn lessons about what action 
at a community level really works for local people on the ground, thereby providing inspiration, 
tools and evidence for other communities that want to take action to better manage their own 
risks. To capture all the learning from the work of  the projects Defra is appointing a scheme level 
evaluator to work alongside the funded projects.

Wildfires

151.  The CCRA identified an increase in the incidence of  wildfires as an emerging risk associated 
with climate change. Severe wildfire has recently been included in the National Risk 
Assessment (NRA12). It is anticipated that Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) will review and 
consider the severe wildfire risk, as will the Fire and Rescue Service through their Integrated 
Risk Management Plan process. The Forestry Commission is publishing guidance for land 
managers to increase the resilience of  woodland to wildfire through forest design planning 
(including forest structure and species). The United Kingdom Forestry Standard includes the 
requirement for contingency planning as part of  good forestry practice.53

147.  The recovery phase following a severe weather event is particularly important for minimising 
some of  the significant health risks identified earlier in this chapter such as the mental 
health and wellbeing impacts associated with flooding. Recovery is best achieved when the 
process starts from the moment the emergency begins, running in tandem with the response. 
Following an emergency, councils will usually co-ordinate the multi-agency recovery process. 
They will chair and provide the secretariat for the Recovery Co-ordinating Group, with support 
from the full range of  multi-agency partners including the private and voluntary sectors 
and the wider community, all of  whom play crucial roles.49 In undertaking this, councils are 
responsible for providing a wide range of  support.50 This includes evacuation and shelter and 
humanitarian assistance.51 The Civil Contingencies Secretariat provides advice and guidance 
to support councils through the National Recovery Guidance.52

Communities

148.  Communities and individuals can help to build their own resilience to severe weather events. 
LRFs, by developing their own resilience plans, encourage communities to get involved in 
work in line with the local risk profile.

149.  The voluntary sector provides an extensive and diverse range of  operational and support 
skills and services to statutory responders. This may take the form of  supporting the 
emergency services during severe weather events with private off-road vehicles and 
boats, helping with recovery, providing financial advice and psycho-social support (such 
as comforting, befriending, listening, help-lines, support networks, drop-in centres, advice, 
counselling, spiritual support and group therapy).

150.  Further examples include the establishment of various local flood groups around the country, 
many of which work under the umbrella of the National Flood Forum. In response to local needs, 
they work closely with the emergency services, LRFs, councils and bodies such as the EA.

Preparation for impact of climate change on wildfires

The England and Wales Wildfire Forum (EWWF) plays a vital role in preparing for the impact of  
climate change on wildfires. It provides a focus for public, private and third sector organisations 
to work together to reduce the effect of  wildfire occurrences. As part of  the National Adaptation 
Programme EWWF:

•  has issued guidance to land managers to reduce the risk of  wildfire occurrence and promote 
preparation of  an effective response and recovery when wildfires do occur

•  is assisting in promoting more appropriate land use and habitats management practice to 
build wildfire resilience for the future

Vision: “Profitable and productive agriculture and forestry sectors that take the opportunities from 
climate change, are resilient to its threats and contribute to the resilience of  the natural environment 
by helping to maintain ecosystem services and protect and enhance biodiversity.”

152.  Our farming and forestry sectors are used to managing their businesses in the context of  
changing weather conditions. They are adept at matching planting, cropping and management 
patterns and balancing good years with bad. In some years the economic impact from 
extreme weather conditions is greater than others. However, the CCRA indicates that extreme 
weather events, such as very high or very low temperatures and changes in precipitation, are 
likely to become more frequent throughout this century. These changes pose a threat to future 
productivity and farming and forestry business incomes. In addition, the cumulative effects 
from soil erosion and disease may affect businesses over many years.

153.  This highlights the need to increase the resilience of the agriculture and forestry sectors. Some 
national measures will need to be put in place. However, businesses will also need to decide 
what action to take on an individual basis. The type of measures which are most suitable will 
vary greatly and be dependent on the locality, the particular crops grown, the types of livestock 
production systems and the species make-up of forest planting and restocking.

154.  The need to adapt effectively should be considered in the context of two other the government 
priorities: i) the sustainable intensification of agriculture and ii) reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
It will be important to find a way of integrating our approach to these important areas.

155.  The CCRA identified a range of direct impacts on the natural and human environment that could 
present opportunities for these sectors, for example, increases in average temperature and 
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, increased yields, opportunities to grow new varieties 
and the provision of ecosystem based adaptation services. Businesses should take note of these 
opportunities and look at how to take advantage of the economic benefits they may offer.

156.  The agriculture and forestry chapter focuses on 4 priority areas: effective water management 
in agriculture, resilience in the forestry sector, effective management of  pests, disease and 
invasive non-native species and innovation and evidence.

CCRA Risk Description

FO1a Forest extent affected by red band needle blight54

WA7 Insufficient summer river flows to meet environmental targets

FL4a/b Agricultural land at risk of  flooding/regular flooding

FO4a Decline in potential yield of  beech trees in England

AG5 Increases in water demand for irrigation of  crops

FO1b Forest extent affected by green spruce aphid

FO2 Loss of  forest productivity due to drought

Focus area 1: Building resilience in agriculture through 
effective water management

Objective 15: To increase the resilience of agriculture by effectively managing the impact 
of volatility in the occurrence and severity of rainfall events on water availability, flooding, 
soil erosion and pollution due to runoff.

157.  Agricultural businesses already have to manage water resources carefully, especially during 
periods of  unusually high or low rainfall. The frequency and severity of  these extreme periods 
are projected to increase as the climate changes, affecting productivity and constraining the 
potential for higher crop yields. Farming businesses will therefore need to adopt effective 
strategies for year-round water management in order to sustainably increase productivity, 
in addition to ensuring watercourses are protected from diffuse agricultural pollution.

158.  The Water Bill, which was announced in the Queen’s speech in May 2013, will introduce 
reforms that will enable farmers and other potential suppliers to enter the competitive water 
supply market. The Bill will also provide ministers with powers to introduce regulations to 
make it easier for farmers and landowners to sell excess water from on-farm reservoirs and 
other water storage facilities direct to water companies.

159.  In order to protect future water supplies and to encourage abstractors, such as farmers, 
to use water more effectively, the government intends to reform the abstraction regulation 
system. The new system will give clearer signals on water availability to allow abstractors 
to plan effectively and invest for the future. Defra will consult on reform proposals in late 
2013 and look to introduce legislation early in the next Parliament. The new system would 
be piloted and then implemented as soon as possible. Following decisions on the direction 
of  reform for the abstraction regulation system, Defra will review the available guidance and 
support for farmers to manage their water availability.

160.  Agricultural land needs to be effectively drained to support viable arable and livestock businesses. 
However, the drainage of some types of land, particularly wetlands, can have negative impacts on 
biodiversity, cause degradation of peat and increase carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

161.  Internal Drainage Boards (IDBs) manage a network of  drainage ditches and pumping stations 
that protect 9.7% of  England. Half  of  this is grade 1 agriculture land and this drainage 
system also protects over half  of  our energy generation capacity and important transport 
infrastructure from regular flooding.55 During Spring 2012, in anticipation of  drought, several 
IDBs kept winter water levels higher than usual to help farmers fill reservoirs and prevent their 
land and wildlife reserves from drying out. The government will work with the Association 
of  Drainage Authorities (ADAs) and other interested parties to explore further the possible 
contribution of  IDBs to integrated water resource management within catchment areas.

162.  Localised water-logging is also an issue in areas where drainage boards do not exist. Defra 
is reviewing the status of  the UK’s aging drainage infrastructure to inform future action that 
supports environmental protection and sustainable intensification.

Chapter 5: Agriculture and Forestry

54 The CCRA selected red band needle blight as an indicative risk of  wider forestry pest and disease impacts. 55 56 major power stations are within IDB districts. This represents 53% of  installed capacity in terms of  maximum potential output.

163.  Good quality soils are essential for agricultural productivity, healthy ecosystems, and the 
delivery of  critical services for society, such as the provision of  clean water and the reduction 
of  flood risk. Healthy soils are also naturally more resilient to erosion so it is important 
to maintain and where possible, enhance them. The Natural Environment White Paper 
(NEWP) sets out the government’s ambition for all soils to be managed sustainably, including 
successfully tackling degradation threats, by 2030. The Soil Protection Review which forms 
part of  the cross-compliance regime under the Common Agricultural Policy aims to provide a 
broad level of  protection for agricultural soils.

164.  Climate change may also increase the environmental impact of  diffuse agricultural water 
pollution. The government’s Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) initiative already delivers 
practical and targeted support to enable farmers and land managers to take voluntary 
action to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture. Defra has invested in a network of  
catchment-scale research sites, called Demonstration Test Catchments, to better understand 
the causes of  diffuse pollution and the effectiveness of  approaches to mitigate it.

Implementation of Catchment Sensitive Farming techniques

Amberley Court Farm is a typical example of  where CSF techniques have been implemented to 
reduce soil erosion and run-off  and improve water efficiency. These measures, implemented at 
little or no cost, have resulted in £9,273 of  financial savings whilst reducing erosion risk and local 
water course pollution, which may become more prevalent in extreme weather conditions.

165.  The EA Climate Ready Support Service in partnership with industry will explore how to establish 
a network of  on-farm demonstration sites to showcase measures to adapt. This network will 
inform work to encourage best practice and innovation in sustainable intensification. In particular 
an industry-led partnership of  Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), National 
Farmers Union (NFU), Royal Agricultural Society of  England (RASE), Land Based Colleges 
Aspiring To Excellence (LANDEX) and others will work to co-ordinate and promote existing on-
farm demonstration activities through developing an online database that will be searchable by 
region, topic and sector. Defra will also look to embed adaptation within the knowledge transfer 
elements of  the UK Agri-Tech Strategy, the Sustainable Intensification Platform and the Rural 
Development Programme for England (RDPE) 2014-2020.

166.  Agricultural and forestry businesses are likely to need some help with developing the right 
skills and knowledge to increase the resilience of  their businesses. The EA’s Climate Ready 
Support Service will work with the sector to develop and promote adaptation good practice, by 
signposting tools and guidance and integrating climate resilience into advisory services such 
as the Farming Advice Service (FAS).

Campaign for the Farmed Environment

Through the next phase of  the agriculture industry’s Campaign for the Farmed Environment 
(CFE), the NFU, working with AHDBs and other interested parties, will aim to build national 
awareness of  the priorities for climate change adaptation. They will disseminate the customised 
practices considered to be most relevant and best suited to the circumstances of  farming 
enterprises in each local area.

167.  The government will consider how to further encourage the uptake of  climate resilience 
measures and skills development though the RDPE. The government will look at the 
opportunities to mainstream adaptation across the programme, supporting skills development 
and knowledge exchange and ensuring RDPE investments offer good value for money. 
Alongside this, Defra is looking at new ‘payment for ecosystem services’ approaches, which 
reward farmers for delivering important services, including adaptation measures that benefit 
wider society (see Chapter 6).

Farm Resilience Plans

Natural England (NE) has worked with the Scottish Agricultural College to test Farm Resilience 
Plans. These plans provide farmers with a way of  identifying the potential impacts of  climate 
change on their farms. FRPs should combine adaptation of  farming practices with good 
management to help the natural environment adapt to changing conditions in a pragmatic 
way. The pilot exercise has tested this approach on 10 farms in the north-west of  England, 
using existing work on adaptation in that region. The results of  the pilot will be used to inform 
development of  agri-environment and advice programmes in the next RDPE.

Actions to address priority risks

and disseminate tailored messages locally

region, topic and sector. Defra will also look to embed adaptation within the knowledge transfer 
elements of  the UK Agri-Tech Strategy, the Sustainable Intensification Platform and the Rural 
Development Programme for England (RDPE) 2014-2020.

166.  Agricultural and forestry businesses are likely to need some help with developing the right 
skills and knowledge to increase the resilience of  their businesses. The EA’s Climate Ready 
Support Service will work with the sector to develop and promote adaptation good practice, by 
signposting tools and guidance and integrating climate resilience into advisory services such 
as the Farming Advice Service (FAS).

Campaign for the Farmed Environment

Through the next phase of  the agriculture industry’s Campaign for the Farmed Environment 
(CFE), the NFU, working with AHDBs and other interested parties, will aim to build national 
awareness of  the priorities for climate change adaptation. They will disseminate the customised 
practices considered to be most relevant and best suited to the circumstances of  farming 
enterprises in each local area.

167.  The government will consider how to further encourage the uptake of  climate resilience 
measures and skills development though the RDPE. The government will look at the 
opportunities to mainstream adaptation across the programme, supporting skills development 
and knowledge exchange and ensuring RDPE investments offer good value for money. 
Alongside this, Defra is looking at new ‘payment for ecosystem services’ approaches, which 
reward farmers for delivering important services, including adaptation measures that benefit 
wider society (see Chapter 6).

Farm Resilience Plans

Natural England (NE) has worked with the Scottish Agricultural College to test Farm Resilience 
Plans. These plans provide farmers with a way of  identifying the potential impacts of  climate 
change on their farms. FRPs should combine adaptation of  farming practices with good 
management to help the natural environment adapt to changing conditions in a pragmatic 
way. The pilot exercise has tested this approach on 10 farms in the north-west of  England, 
using existing work on adaptation in that region. The results of  the pilot will be used to inform 
development of  agri-environment and advice programmes in the next RDPE.

Focus area 2: Resilience in forestry

Objective 16: To increase the resilience of the forestry sector by increasing the level 
of management in England’s woodlands and the uptake of adaptation good practice in 
woodland creation and restocking.

168.  Our woodlands will need to be increasingly resilient to cope with the potential changes in 
climate and more frequent weather extremes. Actively managing more sites, preserving and 
enhancing species diversity and embedding adaptation skills and knowledge will help to 
ensure that our woodlands continue to deliver a wide range of  benefits. Taking climate change 
into consideration in woodland creation and restocking will be particularly important given the 
long time-scales involved.

169.  The government’s Forestry and Woodlands Policy Statement sets out a new approach 
to forestry policy, a clear hierarchy of  protecting, improving and expanding our woodland 
assets.56 The 3 inter-related priorities below will help to increase resilience and drive 
adaptation to climate change:

 •  look to protect trees, woods and forests from the increasing threats of  pests and diseases 
as well as climate change

 • improve their contribution to economic growth, people’s lives and nature 

 •  expand their area to further increase the economic, social and environmental benefits 
they provide 

170.  The commitment to increase levels of  woodland management should help adaptation, 
as well-managed woodlands are likely to be more resilient to climate change. The policy 
statement also sets out how targeted woodland creation can deliver a broad range of  
ecosystem services to aid adaptation in other sectors, as well as developing a more resilient 
woodland resource. 

171.  The Forestry Commission’s Adaptation Plan sets out particular steps which, alongside 
industry action, are essential for building a sustainable forestry sector.57 These actions include 
the further development of  advice and guidance on species diversification, implementation 
of  the Climate Change Action Plan for Public Forests58, promotion of  woodland management 
planning and the embedding of  adaptation actions as standard practice in the application of  
forestry regulations and in forestry measures in the RDPE. The Forestry Commission (FC) 
is also working with members of  the England Woodland and Timber Partnership (EWTP) to 
promote the ‘UK Forestry Standard (UKFS) Forests and Climate Change Guidelines’ more 
widely, and to increase the diversity and supply of  suitable planting stock.59

The England Woodland and Timber Partnership

The EWTP will develop a Climate Change Action Plan as the forestry sector’s contribution 
to the National Adaptation Programme. It will focus on: raising awareness, developing and 
promoting good practice, increasing the availability of  good quality seeds and trees to support 
diversification, developing the sector’s skills, increasing the uptake of  the UKFS and continuing 
to promote increased woodland creation and usage of  solid wood products.

Focus area 3: Resilience to pests and disease

Objective 17: To increase resilience to pests and disease to help protect biodiversity, 
maintain agricultural and forestry productivity and protect the UK’s ability to export 
products.

172.  Pests and disease pose a significant risk to the sustainability of  the agriculture and forestry 
sectors and the wider natural world. Recent events, such as ash dieback (due to ‘Chalara’) 
have only served to underline this. Proportionate action is needed to manage the threat of  
outbreaks and pest infestations, to protect the viability of  farms and woodlands and to protect 
the UK’s ability to export products. There are gaps in the evidence base which will need to be 
filled to properly inform longer term planning.

173.  Preparing for and managing risk from plant disease is one of Defra’s top priorities. 
The Secretary of  State commissioned an independent Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Expert 
Task Force (THPBETF), convened by Defra’s Chief Scientific Adviser, to look at ways to prevent 
pests and diseases from entering the country in the future and to better manage those that are 
already present. The Task Force has reported and the government will respond shortly.

174.  The implementation of  the ‘Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Action Plan’ is being 
accelerated as recommended by the Independent Panel on Forestry and the THPBETF.60

It aims to strengthen import control activities and protocols, improve our surveillance strategy 
for tree pests and disease and raise the public’s and professionals’ awareness of  them. 
It will also make the best use of  existing evidence and commission new work to strengthen 
the evidence base on how climate change will affect the spread of  pests and disease.

175.  The Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA), working with Defra and the Health and 
Safety Executive’s Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD), will review the extent to which 
current plant health protection programmes integrate climate risk, establishing where further 
evidence is required. This will inform Defra’s evidence plans within its plant health portfolio. 
Following decisions on the structure and function of  FERA, a decision will be taken on 
whether FERA will be asked to prepare a voluntary adaptation report.

176.  Adaptation strategies are needed to build longer-term resilience to pests and diseases in a 
changing environment. The Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Evidence Plan recognises that 
trees help to mitigate climate change, while also being at risk from it directly and indirectly.61 
A strategic Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative, within the framework of  the Living With 
Environmental Change (LWEC) partnership, will include research that helps develop longer-
term strategies for adaptation and resilience to current and future pest and disease threats 
in a changing environment. In general, climate change scenarios will also be included in risk 
assessments for new pest and disease threats, thereby helping to protect our plant resources, 
including crops and plants in the wider environment. 

177.  Animal health and welfare is already a priority for the government. For example, Defra is 
strengthening surveillance and monitoring systems for exotic and endemic animal diseases, 
working in partnership with agencies and industries. In response to the CCRA which pointed 
to a lack of  understanding of  the direct effects of  climate change on the livestock sector, 
Defra will improve the evidence base. It will do this by working with industry, research partners 
and European colleagues to examine different sectors, welfare indicators and management 
practices. Defra will also continue to press the EU to adopt a harmonised approach to disease 
surveillance and horizon scanning. 

178.  Defra is also working with its agencies (AHVLA, FERA and NE) and with wildlife and wild bird 
specialists (including the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and the British Trust for Ornithology) to 
look at emerging threats to biodiversity as a result of  climate change.

179.  Invasive non-native species (INNS) are one of  the main threats to biodiversity globally and 
cost the English economy more than £1.3 billion annually. Climate change will enable some 
INNS to become more common and some INNS which are currently benign, to become 
invasive. Defra will review the Invasive Non-native Species Framework Strategy for Great 
Britain (2008) to ensure that the approach of  prevention, detection, rapid response, long-term 
mitigation and control continues to take account of  new and emerging risks.

Objective 18: To embed climate change adaptation into agriculture, horticulture and 
forestry research programmes, in order to improve knowledge of likely climate impacts 
and contribute to the development and uptake of climate resilient crops, tree and 
livestock species as well as relevant technologies.

180.  Biological systems are complex, so trying to project the combined effect of  multiple climate 
impacts upon them in the context of  a number of  uncertain variables is an inexact science. 
To effectively adapt to climate change and exploit opportunities, we need to both improve our 
knowledge and develop strategies that effectively manage this uncertainty.

181.  The government recognises the importance of  developing well-adapted trees, crops and 
livestock species. Given the long lead times involved, work needs to start now to ensure 
timely deployment of  well-adapted species. To adapt to unprecedented growing conditions, 
pioneering new approaches to selecting and developing varieties with the necessary 
combination of  physiological traits will be required. This will ensure important forestry 
and agriculture species are adapted to future climates, including the combinations of  day 
length, temperature extremes, carbon dioxide concentrations and rainfall patterns that have 
never previously been experienced. Similar adaptation of  livestock species, particularly to 
temperature extremes and potentially different diets, can also be anticipated.

Research forests

Research forests have been established in England, Scotland and Wales to develop and test 
adaptation strategies for forestry. These, together with collaborative action at the European scale 
through research programmes such as the REINFORCE species trials will provide valuable 
insight to inform adaptation strategies.

182.  Modern genetics, breeding techniques and effective knowledge transfer could all play a 
role in building the climate resilience of  the agricultural sector. The government’s new 
Agri-Tech Strategy will recognise that climate change will have an impact on the sustainable 
intensification of  agriculture and meeting global food security challenges and sets out the 
need to increase development and uptake of  emerging technologies and improve skills. 
The Strategy will draw on evidence such as the sector-led ‘Feeding the Future’ report to 
inform future actions/implementation.

Feeding the Future Report

The Feeding the Future Report looks to inform the industry on specific areas for action.  
The industry-led Report recognises the importance of  modern genetics and breeding 
techniques and effective knowledge transfer for climate resilience. The intention of  the 
Report’s commissioning group is to use the recommendations as a basis for dialogue with both 
government and industry funders of  research and knowledge transfer, including divisions of  
AHDB and future Technology Strategy Board funding. This Report will help focus both basic and 
more applied research in the areas which will deliver greatest economic returns to the UK.

183.  While advanced conventional plant breeding techniques will clearly play a role in the 
development of  sustainable and climate-resilient crops, recent reports and studies have 
pointed to Genetic Modification (GM) as being an important tool for addressing the 
unprecedented challenges that lie ahead.62 The government is therefore keen to encourage 
the development of  a wide range of  technologies and is working to unblock the EU regulatory 
regime to allow fair market access for GM products which have undergone a comprehensive 
environmental risk assessment.

184.  The long-term nature of  forestry and the urgency of  action requires the development of  
approaches that effectively manage uncertainty. In Autumn 2013 the Forestry Commission 
will publish the revised Science and Innovation Strategy for British Forestry. The Strategy will 
include the development of  robust evidence to inform climate change adaptation for forestry 
and to support actions to increase the resilience of  British woodland and the ecosystem 
services it provides for society.

185.  The government also recognises the critical importance of  developing soil science capacity 
to protect and enhance our soils in the face of  pressures such as climate change and to 
enable sustainable intensification. Defra is undertaking a significant research programme to 
explore how soil degradation can affect the soil’s ability to support vital ecosystem services 
such as flood mitigation, carbon storage and nutrient cycling. This will be delivered alongside 
two joint BBSRC and Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) research programmes 
on soils being proposed with an overall budget of  £12million. NERC has approved funding 
for a £5.5million five year programme on soils. The initial BBSRC-led call (lasting 3 to 5 
years) will be focused on the latest technologies (eg imaging methods and meta-genomics) 
and integrated research approaches to increase our understanding of  important interactions 
between crops, microbes and soil processes in agricultural systems. This will be followed by a 
prospective NERC-led 5 year programme to help predict how soils are likely to function in the 
context of  changes in climate and land use. Outputs would be used to inform future decisions 
on local and regional management of  soils for food security and climate mitigation.

Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)

BBSRC are contributing €3million to a €18million ERANET+ programme which brings together 
researchers from 16 countries to develop resilience around crops and livestock systems. Areas 
the programme will focus on include preserving soil, water and genetic sources, emerging and 
re-emerging pests and diseases and socio-economic aspects of  adaptation. New technologies 
which aid adaptive water and soil management will be investigated, including those that: improve 
water harvesting, increase water efficiency and efficient fertilisation practices, monitor and 
reduce greenhouse gases and increase and verify soil and biomass carbon stocks.

186.  The ECR report describes extreme weather as carrying greater risks for agriculture than 
changes in long term average climate conditions.63 Consultation with the industry also 
highlighted extreme weather events as a particular concern for agriculture. Research to 
develop and assess the effect on agriculture of  a range of  plausible extreme weather event 
scenarios is underway and will be used to inform policy development and industry action. 
This work will also inform Defra’s new Sustainable Intensification Research Platform which 
will develop integrated approaches to land management that can sustainably provide food 
and deliver environmental outcomes. The Research Platform will include research on the 
wider contextual drivers for decision-making on UK farms, including the influences of  climate, 
global commodity markets, consumer choice, the development of  markets for ecosystem 
services and the demand for biofuels.

187.  At EU level Defra is working with European partners on the development of  a Joint 
Programming Initiative to coordinate EU research on agriculture, food security and 
climate change.

Research forests

Research forests have been established in England, Scotland and Wales to develop and test 
adaptation strategies for forestry. These, together with collaborative action at the European scale 
through research programmes such as the REINFORCE species trials will provide valuable 
insight to inform adaptation strategies.

182.  Modern genetics, breeding techniques and effective knowledge transfer could all play a 
role in building the climate resilience of  the agricultural sector. The government’s new 
Agri-Tech Strategy will recognise that climate change will have an impact on the sustainable 
intensification of  agriculture and meeting global food security challenges and sets out the 
need to increase development and uptake of  emerging technologies and improve skills. 
The Strategy will draw on evidence such as the sector-led ‘Feeding the Future’ report to 
inform future actions/implementation.

Feeding the Future Report

The Feeding the Future Report looks to inform the industry on specific areas for action.  
The industry-led Report recognises the importance of  modern genetics and breeding 
techniques and effective knowledge transfer for climate resilience. The intention of  the 
Report’s commissioning group is to use the recommendations as a basis for dialogue with both 
government and industry funders of  research and knowledge transfer, including divisions of  
AHDB and future Technology Strategy Board funding. This Report will help focus both basic and 
more applied research in the areas which will deliver greatest economic returns to the UK.

183.  While advanced conventional plant breeding techniques will clearly play a role in the 
development of  sustainable and climate-resilient crops, recent reports and studies have 
pointed to Genetic Modification (GM) as being an important tool for addressing the 
unprecedented challenges that lie ahead.62 The government is therefore keen to encourage 
the development of  a wide range of  technologies and is working to unblock the EU regulatory 
regime to allow fair market access for GM products which have undergone a comprehensive 
environmental risk assessment.

184.  The long-term nature of  forestry and the urgency of  action requires the development of  
approaches that effectively manage uncertainty. In Autumn 2013 the Forestry Commission 
will publish the revised Science and Innovation Strategy for British Forestry. The Strategy will 
include the development of  robust evidence to inform climate change adaptation for forestry 
and to support actions to increase the resilience of  British woodland and the ecosystem 
services it provides for society.

185.  The government also recognises the critical importance of  developing soil science capacity 
to protect and enhance our soils in the face of  pressures such as climate change and to 
enable sustainable intensification. Defra is undertaking a significant research programme to 
explore how soil degradation can affect the soil’s ability to support vital ecosystem services 
such as flood mitigation, carbon storage and nutrient cycling. This will be delivered alongside 
two joint BBSRC and Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) research programmes 
on soils being proposed with an overall budget of  £12million. NERC has approved funding 
for a £5.5million five year programme on soils. The initial BBSRC-led call (lasting 3 to 5 
years) will be focused on the latest technologies (eg imaging methods and meta-genomics) 
and integrated research approaches to increase our understanding of  important interactions 
between crops, microbes and soil processes in agricultural systems. This will be followed by a 
prospective NERC-led 5 year programme to help predict how soils are likely to function in the 
context of  changes in climate and land use. Outputs would be used to inform future decisions 
on local and regional management of  soils for food security and climate mitigation.

Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)

BBSRC are contributing €3million to a €18million ERANET+ programme which brings together 
researchers from 16 countries to develop resilience around crops and livestock systems. Areas 
the programme will focus on include preserving soil, water and genetic sources, emerging and 
re-emerging pests and diseases and socio-economic aspects of  adaptation. New technologies 
which aid adaptive water and soil management will be investigated, including those that: improve 
water harvesting, increase water efficiency and efficient fertilisation practices, monitor and 
reduce greenhouse gases and increase and verify soil and biomass carbon stocks.

186.  The ECR report describes extreme weather as carrying greater risks for agriculture than 
changes in long term average climate conditions.63 Consultation with the industry also 
highlighted extreme weather events as a particular concern for agriculture. Research to 
develop and assess the effect on agriculture of  a range of  plausible extreme weather event 
scenarios is underway and will be used to inform policy development and industry action. 
This work will also inform Defra’s new Sustainable Intensification Research Platform which 
will develop integrated approaches to land management that can sustainably provide food 
and deliver environmental outcomes. The Research Platform will include research on the 
wider contextual drivers for decision-making on UK farms, including the influences of  climate, 
global commodity markets, consumer choice, the development of  markets for ecosystem 
services and the demand for biofuels.

187.  At EU level Defra is working with European partners on the development of  a Joint 
Programming Initiative to coordinate EU research on agriculture, food security and 
climate change.

Vision: “The natural environment, with diverse and healthy ecosystems, is resilient to climate 
change, able to accommodate change and valued for the adaptation services it provides.”

188.  The natural world, its biodiversity, landscapes and ecosystems is critically important for our 
wellbeing and economic prosperity. Our ecosystems provide us with a wide range of  services 
including clear air, clean water, green space, as well as contact with nature. However, the 
ability of  ecosystems to produce these services at current levels will be vulnerable to climate 
change. The natural world is in a perpetual state of  change, but the increasing pace of  
change will place unprecedented pressures on access to and use of  our natural resources. 
The scale of  this was recognised by Professor Sir John Lawton’s independent review (2010) 
of  England’s wildlife sites and ecological network, which clearly concluded that England’s 
collection of  wildlife areas is fragmented and does not represent a coherent and resilient 
ecological network which is capable of  responding to climate change and other pressures.64

189.  As conditions change, there is a big risk that species in terrestrial, coastal, freshwater and 
marine environments that are particularly sensitive to temperature changes, will not be able 
to move northwards to suitable cooler habitats. This could result in the loss of  vulnerable 
species. Other urgent risks include flooding and coastal erosion, low river flows, reduced 
water quality and drier soils, all of  which can damage habitats. The risk of  pests, disease and 
invasive non-native species may also increase (see Chapter 5) and important landscapes and 
heritage sites may also be threatened.

190.  Climate change presents some opportunities. The economic benefits provided by the natural 
environment’s regulating and provisioning services are likely to increase. This may create new 
markets if  these services can be given a monetary value. The habitat range for some species 
may increase and some new and valued non-native species may enter the UK. For example, 
our fishing industry may benefit from increased numbers of  fish such as sea bass, red mullet, 
boarfish and squid. There are also recreational opportunities linked to and possible increases 
to rural tourism if  we experience warmer summers.

191.  There are 4 main objectives for this theme. They focus on building ecological resilience, 
accommodating the changes that are inevitable, valuing how the natural environment can 
help other sectors become more resilient and improving the evidence base. These objectives 
reflect the principles set out in the Natural Environment White Paper (NEWP).65

192. Ecosystems can become more resilient to the impacts of  climate change and the government
is keen to improve the environment, including through taking action to adapt. Particularly
important policies include joining up the management of  the natural environment at a larger
scale, often termed ‘landscape scale approach’ and making sure protected sites are in good
condition, sufficiently large, numerous and where possible connected.66, 67 Coastal zones,
uplands and wetlands are among the habitats of  high biodiversity value that are particularly
sensitive to climate change.

193.  The case for strong, healthy ecosystems has been well defined in recent the government 
policies, in particular ‘The Natural Choice: Securing the Value of  Nature’ White Paper (2011), 
‘Biodiversity 2020’, the ‘Water for Life’ White Paper (2012), the ‘Marine Policy Statement’ 
(2011) and the ‘Forestry and Woodland Policy Statement’ (2013).68, 69, 70, 71 A priority for the 
NAP is to implement these framework policies in a way that increases the resilience of  our 
natural environment. The government will also embed actions to increase climate resilience 
into the Rural Development Programme for England 2014–2020 (see Chapter 5).

194.  The government wants to see more integrated approaches to terrestrial biodiversity 
and ecosystems management that reflect both local and larger scale priorities. Nature 
Improvement Areas (NIAs) and Local Nature Partnerships (LNPs) have been established to 
facilitate this. The NAP will help us to ensure that these approaches embed good adaptive 
management practices. This will increase the likelihood that more species will be able to 
survive changes in climate, through increasing local population resilience and the colonisation 
of  new areas.

Nature Improvement Areas

Local authorities, communities, landowners, businesses and conservation organisations are 
working in partnership to create better connected habitats over a landscape scale. These will 
help create areas in which wildlife can thrive and adapt to climate change. The first 12 NIAs 
began work in April 2012 and have already made good progress in uniting people around plans 
that provide for both communities and wildlife. Building on this success, the government is now 
encouraging others to adopt this approach voluntarily.

195.  Recognising this, Natural England (NE) is piloting adaptive management approaches in 
NIAs, and the EA’s Climate Ready Support Service is working with LNPs to develop advice 
and tools to help land managers and advisers take informed decisions about climate risks 
and adaptation actions. Equally, the tools and guidance provided to the forestry sector by 
the Forestry Commission (FC) will help to adapt our ancient and native woodland, as will the 
government’s ambition to bring more of  England’s woodlands into sustainable management.

The Crown Estate

The Crown Estate manages a diverse property and land portfolio representing a range of  
adaptation opportunities and challenges at a local level. They work with a variety of  partner 
organisations to establish projects focusing on adaptation in terms of  biodiversity, building design, 
and changes in agricultural and forestry. Educational engagement aims to improve understanding 
of  the challenges. For instance the Forests for the Future school education pack looks at the role 
of  forests in climate change adaptation. In addition climate change factors have been integrated 
into investment decision making process to improve our understanding of  future risks.

196.  In 2011, the government set out the long term priorities for the water industry in the Water 
White Paper. This set out the evidence and made the case for change to plan now to protect 
the resilience of  future water supplies. This planning should take into account climate change, 
population growth, patterns of  demand and the need for resilience to hazards such as 
drought and flooding.

197.  Through River Basin Management Planning, the government aims to provide a resilient, 
sustainable water environment that protects existing quality and promotes improvements 
where there are significant benefits. These benefits will be judged across a range of  
ecosystem services, including the provision of  sufficient clean water for drinking, recreation, 
wildlife and adapting to a changing climate.

The Rivers Trust

The Rivers Trust movement adopts an ecosystem approach to the management of  river 
catchments, working with a wide range of  Defra partners to enhance freshwater resources 
nationwide. Much of  this work implements action ‘on the ground’ that reduces the risk to 
freshwater from climate change. The provision of  advice to farmers, for example, leads to 
reductions in soil erosion and the associated loss of  carbon from rural land. Soft engineering 
measures are also implemented to slow and retain water on the hillside. Not only does this 
reduce flood risk downstream, it also helps to maintain summer base flow in rivers.

198.  The EA is currently developing the second cycle of  River Basin Management Plans for 
delivery in 2015 and the assessment of  climate change risks and necessary adaptation 
actions will be integrated within them.

199.  The EA, other parts of  Defra and interested parties have also been piloting a catchment-
based approach since March 2012. This involves the development of  plans to address water 
quality issues and which recognise and integrate other local priorities. The pilots have been 
supported by the EA Climate Ready Support Service to develop and embed adaptation good 
practice. This learning will inform the wider roll-out of  the catchment approach in 2014. This is 
the sort of  innovative approach that the regulatory framework can enable to help deliver long 
term resilience, including to climate change.

200.  The government is committed to reforming the water abstraction regulation system to protect 
rivers and water bodies from over abstraction as pressures increase from climate change and 
population growth (see Chapter 5).

201.  The government also recognises that for the reformed abstraction regime to be sustainable, 
the current problem of  over abstraction needs to be addressed. The EA is working to reduce 
the environmental impact of  the over abstraction of  water through its Restoring Sustainable 
Abstraction (RSA) programme. It has reviewed thousands of  licences and changed many 
of  the most damaging. The Water Act 2003 contains a power which will allow licenses to be 
modified without compensation where this is to prevent serious environmental damage.72 
As highlighted in the Water White Paper, Defra, Ofwat and the EA are working to move 
funding for water companies for restoring sustainable abstractions into the Water Price 
Review process to deliver the best value for customers.

202.  To address increased pressures on coastal habitats the EA will work alongside partners 
including local councils to ensure that Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) value the 
ecosystem benefits to the wider environment. SMPs will address flood control and potential 
habitat losses from climate change including how to compensate for losses at nature reserves 
and designated sites.

203.  While the impacts of  climate change on the marine environment are less certain, it is 
important that robust strategies are developed to manage them. Protecting and restoring 
marine habitats will increase their resilience to climate change and Defra has committed to 
designating at least 25% of  English waters as Marine Protected Areas. These will enable 
Defra to create a series of  conservation zones as a well managed network of  habitats that 
will aid the movement of  species affected by climate change and decrease threats such as 
over-fishing.

204.  Well managed fish stocks are much less susceptible to climate impacts.73 However as a 
consequence of  climate change, in some cases, fish stocks will not be able to sustain the 
same level of  fishing they have experienced in the past. More flexible regional fisheries 
management will help accommodate the changes in species distribution and allow fisheries 
managers to make use of  the opportunities these changes may bring. The government is 
seeking a conclusion to the EU negotiations by the end of  2013 of  a reformed Common 
Fisheries Policy, which will deliver sustainable use of  fish stocks, a healthy marine 
environment and a prosperous fishing industry. The fishing industry and management of  
fisheries will need to examine how species distribution may change in order to capitalise on 
any possible opportunities.74

205.  In co-operation with the seafood industry, Seafish will prepare a voluntary report under the 
Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP) to assess how climate change will affect the functioning 
of  the fishing and wider seafood industry and the actions necessary to address these 
risks. The Marine Management Organisation will also prepare a voluntary report under the 
ARP to assess how climate change will impact on the delivery of  its functions, such as the 
development of  marine spatial plans and the issuing of  licenses. It will consider what needs to 
be done to address the risks identified.

206.  Given the uncertainty around the effects on the marine environment, the government is 
working directly with other marine organisations through the Marine Climate Change Impacts 
Partnership (MCCIP). The MCCIP aims to develop and share knowledge, guidance, best 
practice tools and strategies for the sector and to identify current shortcomings in UK marine 
climate science. This is supported through the new Cefas Marine Climate Change Centre 
(MC3).75

207.  Improving the environment is not only based on conserving the value of  nature but on 
protecting England’s landscapes, archaeological sites and historic buildings that people 
value. Many of  these are threatened by climate change, most notably flooding to ancient 
monuments, but also coastal erosion and seasonal groundwater depletion affecting the 
foundations of  buildings. The National Heritage Protection Plan sets out how English Heritage 
together with partners in the heritage sector, will prioritise and deliver heritage protection 
from 2011 to 2015. This includes actions such as the continuation of  ‘Rapid Coastal Zone 
Assessment Surveys’ that record and assess the risk to heritage assets on the coast. It also 
focuses research on developing the evidence base that is required to ensure that appropriate 
decisions are made to avoid unnecessary degradation.76

English Heritage and the Church of England’s ‘Shrinking the Footprint’ 
campaign

As protectors and custodians of  many of  the nation’s historic assets, English Heritage and the 
Church of  England will develop voluntary adaptation reports under the Secretary of  State’s ARP. 
Once they have assessed the risks and developed strategies to address these, they will develop 
a joint action plan alongside other historic asset managers to ensure the nation’s historic assets 
are as resilient to climate change as they can be.

201.  The government also recognises that for the reformed abstraction regime to be sustainable, 
the current problem of  over abstraction needs to be addressed. The EA is working to reduce 
the environmental impact of  the over abstraction of  water through its Restoring Sustainable 
Abstraction (RSA) programme. It has reviewed thousands of  licences and changed many 
of  the most damaging. The Water Act 2003 contains a power which will allow licenses to be 
modified without compensation where this is to prevent serious environmental damage.72 
As highlighted in the Water White Paper, Defra, Ofwat and the EA are working to move 
funding for water companies for restoring sustainable abstractions into the Water Price 
Review process to deliver the best value for customers.

202.  To address increased pressures on coastal habitats the EA will work alongside partners 
including local councils to ensure that Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) value the 
ecosystem benefits to the wider environment. SMPs will address flood control and potential 
habitat losses from climate change including how to compensate for losses at nature reserves 
and designated sites.

203.  While the impacts of  climate change on the marine environment are less certain, it is 
important that robust strategies are developed to manage them. Protecting and restoring 
marine habitats will increase their resilience to climate change and Defra has committed to 
designating at least 25% of  English waters as Marine Protected Areas. These will enable 
Defra to create a series of  conservation zones as a well managed network of  habitats that 
will aid the movement of  species affected by climate change and decrease threats such as 
over-fishing.

204.  Well managed fish stocks are much less susceptible to climate impacts.73 However as a 
consequence of  climate change, in some cases, fish stocks will not be able to sustain the 
same level of  fishing they have experienced in the past. More flexible regional fisheries 
management will help accommodate the changes in species distribution and allow fisheries 
managers to make use of  the opportunities these changes may bring. The government is 
seeking a conclusion to the EU negotiations by the end of  2013 of  a reformed Common 
Fisheries Policy, which will deliver sustainable use of  fish stocks, a healthy marine 
environment and a prosperous fishing industry. The fishing industry and management of  
fisheries will need to examine how species distribution may change in order to capitalise on 
any possible opportunities.74

205.  In co-operation with the seafood industry, Seafish will prepare a voluntary report under the 
Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP) to assess how climate change will affect the functioning 
of  the fishing and wider seafood industry and the actions necessary to address these

208.  While there is uncertainty about the rate, severity and nature of  potential climate change 
impacts, it is clear that the character and distribution of  habitats and the species that live 
in them will change. At a local level, changing conservation priorities need to be assessed 
and planned for, such as by providing habitats for new species that arrive to colonise sites. 

Nationally and at the landscape level, careful thought needs to be given to whether current 
plans and strategies will deliver resilient ecological networks under different scenarios. The 
Natural Environment White Paper (NEWP) and Biodiversity 2020, have started to consider 
this by setting challenging visions for 2050 as well as more immediate outcomes for 2020.

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), National Trust, 
The Wildlife Trusts and Woodland Trust

These organisations are starting to plan for scenarios for a 2ºC world, while seeking to 
understand more about the impacts of  a 4ºC rise: “We recognise the importance of  collaboration 
at a national and a landscape scale to create a resilient natural environment and ecological 
networks. We are embedding climate change adaptation measures into our site management to 
build resilience and accommodate change, as our special nature sites will continue to be critically 
important as reservoirs of  wildlife. We will look to work in partnership with Defra and its agencies 
to share knowledge and best practice and build a national network of  sites and landscape scale 
initiatives that deliver the best for biodiversity with current and future climate changes. We will 
also engage our supporters to help them understand that some change is inevitable and that the 
changes in our management activities are part of  a carefully planned transition.’’

209.  The conservation priorities of  a particular site may change with the climate. NE will 
review existing protected sites and consider protecting new areas as the climate changes. 
Organisations that manage nature reserves, including the RSPB, the Wildlife Trusts, the 
National Trust and the Woodland Trust, will work with EA as well as NE to share evidence 
and best practice in management planning. This will enable these important sites to make the 
transition in ways that allow them to retain high biodiversity value, thereby enabling them to 
play a vital nature conservation role as part of  a connected and coherent series of  sites along 
with other protected areas.

210.  Some degree of  change in the wildlife and habitats of  nature sites is inevitable but this may not 
always be well understood, particularly at the local level. Effective communication work with 
both land managers and the public is therefore essential to ensure that proactive adaptation 
measures do not experience uninformed local opposition. NE and partners are developing an 
adaptation manual that can be used by land managers and conservation practitioners to help 
them better understand local impacts. Several environmental organisations are also developing 
their own strategies to educate their members and visitors to their sites.

Focus area 3: Valuing the wider adaptation benefits the 
natural environment can deliver

Objective 21: To promote and gain widespread uptake in other sectors of adaptation 
measures that benefit, or do not adversely affect, the natural environment.

211.  Decisions taken in other sectors can have a positive or detrimental impact on the ability of  
the natural environment to adapt. It is important that adaptation plans in other sectors take 
account of  the role of  the natural environment and develop solutions that work with the grain 
of  nature.

212.  Working innovatively with natural systems and promoting ‘Ecosystem Based Adaptation’ 
approaches can create opportunities to reduce costs and provide multiple benefits for society. 
Some examples include planting trees in cities to cool the air or managing flood risk through 
the creation of  wetlands. These approaches can benefit biodiversity, provide recreational 
space and reduce costs compared to air conditioning. However, these approaches also need 
better decision support tools, a clearer framework for their use and new ways to better value 
the services they deliver and to seek payment from those who benefit.

213.  As a first step Defra developed the ‘National Ecosystem Assessment’ (2011). This helps to 
better understand both the true value derived from the natural environment and the possible 
future threats to the goods and services it provides. Defra is now developing tools to help 
decision makers to take account of  the value of  nature and to find approaches which maximise 
the benefits society gets from its ecosystems. Alongside this, NE has worked with the Green 
Infrastructure Partnership (GIP) to develop tools and advice that help local decision makers 
better understand how green infrastructure and ‘Ecosystem Based Approaches’ can also 
support local objectives and help build greater resilience in a changing climate.

214.  Defra has since published a number of  reports on how investing in natural infrastructure can 
deliver a range of  benefits for society.77 The ECR report sought to begin to analyse the costs 
and benefits of  using natural approaches to flood risk management by suggesting appropriate 
methodologies for analysis.78

215.  Defra is looking at how paying for ecosystems services could work. In Spring 2013 Defra 
published the ‘Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) Action Plan’ alongside best practice 
guidance on taking forward PES schemes.79 This emphasised that PES design should take 
account of  climate change and recognised that climate change itself  may make the case 
stronger for investing in natural solutions. The NEWP contained a commitment to set up the 
business-led Ecosystems Market Task Force. Its role is to review the opportunities available 
to UK businesses to develop markets which value and protect the environment. The Task 
Force reported in March 2013. In its report it laid out a number of  recommendations to 
the government, some of  which are relevant to adaptation. Defra will consider these in its 
response to the report.

216.  The NEWP established the Natural Capital Committee and the Green Economy Council.80 
They work to prioritise actions that support and improve the UK’s natural assets. A priority area 
is the protection of  peatlands that enable water purification, carbon sequestration, flood risk 
management and habitat creation. Ministers from across the UK outlined their intentions to aim 
to enhance the natural capital of  UK peatlands in a letter to the IUCN UK Peatland Programme 
(a partnership of  environmental bodies working to promote peat restoration). Actions include 
reducing peat used in horticulture in England to 0 by 2030.

217.  The planning process is a major point in the decision making process where adaptation 
needs to be considered. The European Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) includes within its scope the consideration of  the impact on a proposed development 
of  climate change. The European Commission recently published guidance to improve the 
consideration of  climate change and biodiversity in the EIA process.

The Institute for Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA)

IEMA is taking a proactive approach with its members in considering the importance of  climate 
change and the natural environment to their activities. While the proposed addition to the 
Environmental Impacts Assessment Directive (EIA) may take until 2016 to come into force in the 
UK, IEMA has a programme of  work that will ensure many of  the UK’s assessments already 
consider climate change adaptation well before 2016. This work programme includes webinars 
on the forthcoming EC guidance on integrating climate change and biodiversity into the EIA 
and Strategic Environmental Assessments process, as well as launching new climate change, 
biodiversity and EIA information pages and advice notes.

218.  Whilst there are many adaptation actions that can be taken now, there is significant 
uncertainty that limits our capacity to make informed decisions. It is essential that the 
knowledge base continues to be developed to help users better understand the need to adapt 
and to identify appropriate measures to do so.

219.  The CCRA highlighted important gaps in the data that need to be addressed to better understand 
the impacts of  climate change on biodiversity. In response, Defra and its agencies have worked 
with the Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) partnership to develop biodiversity and 
water ‘Climate Change Impact Report Cards’ to better understand current uncertainty. Defra has 
also commissioned new research that will feed into the Biodiversity Impacts of  Climate Change 
Observation Network (BICCO-net81) that will extend work to cover freshwater systems, conduct 
more detailed analysis to separate climate change impacts from other drivers of  change, develop 
climate change indicators and continue to support knowledge transfer.

Marine Climate Change Impacts Report Card

A Marine Climate Change Impacts Report Card was originally developed by the Marine Climate Change 
Impacts Partnerships (MCCIP) in 2006 and is updated annually. This identifies the observed impacts 
and where possible the magnitude and timing of possible future impacts and brings together co-
ordinated advice from a range of scientists, government, agencies and NGOs. Following the success of  
these annual reports, NE and the EA developed further cards on water and terrestrial biodiversity.

220.  To address uncertainty surrounding the impact of  climate change on river flows and their 
ability to meet environmental targets, the EA is scoping a new long term research effort to 
improve environmental flow indicators and inform future water resource planning.

221.  Scientific work on ocean acidification and its impacts has been carried out by a wide range of UK 
research centres, university groups, government bodies and other organisations. In 2010 most of  
that effort was brought together by the UK Ocean Acidification (UKOA) research programme. This 
is a £12.4million, 5 year initiative funded by Defra, DECC and NERC to increase the understanding 
of ocean acidification processes and reduce uncertainties in predicting ocean acidification 
impacts. This will go a long way to addressing the uncertainty of  the risk highlighted in the CCRA.

218.  Whilst there are many adaptation actions that can be taken now, there is significant 
uncertainty that limits our capacity to make informed decisions. It is essential that the 
knowledge base continues to be developed to help users better understand the need to adapt 
and to identify appropriate measures to do so.

219.  The CCRA highlighted important gaps in the data that need to be addressed to better understand 
the impacts of  climate change on biodiversity. In response, Defra and its agencies have worked 
with the Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) partnership to develop biodiversity and 
water ‘Climate Change Impact Report Cards’ to better understand current uncertainty. Defra has 
also commissioned new research that will feed into the Biodiversity Impacts of  Climate Change 
Observation Network (BICCO-net81) that will extend work to cover freshwater systems, conduct 
more detailed analysis to separate climate change impacts from other drivers of  change, develop 
climate change indicators and continue to support knowledge transfer.

Marine Climate Change Impacts Report Card

A Marine Climate Change Impacts Report Card was originally developed by the Marine Climate Change 
Impacts Partnerships (MCCIP) in 2006 and is updated annually. This identifies the observed impacts 
and where possible the magnitude and timing of possible future impacts and brings together co-
ordinated advice from a range of scientists, government, agencies and NGOs. Following the success of  
these annual reports, NE and the EA developed further cards on water and terrestrial biodiversity.

220.  To address uncertainty surrounding the impact of  climate change on river flows and their 
ability to meet environmental targets, the EA is scoping a new long term research effort to 
improve environmental flow indicators and inform future water resource planning.

221.  Scientific work on ocean acidification and its impacts has been carried out by a wide range of UK 
research centres, university groups, government bodies and other organisations. In 2010 most of  
that effort was brought together by the UK Ocean Acidification (UKOA) research programme. This 
is a £12.4million, 5 year initiative funded by Defra, DECC and NERC to increase the understanding 
of ocean acidification processes and reduce uncertainties in predicting ocean acidification 
impacts. This will go a long way to addressing the uncertainty of  the risk highlighted in the CCRA.

Vision: “UK businesses are resilient to extreme weather and prepared for future risks and 
opportunities from climate change.”

222.  The impacts of  a changing climate will increase the risk of  financial loss or damage to 
businesses, but will also offer wide ranging opportunities to UK businesses, whether they 
are producing goods or providing services. The relationship to the growth agenda has 
two aspects.

223.  First, it is about reducing the risks that could constrain economic growth. For example, 
Unilever estimated that the impacts of  climate change led to an additional €200 million ($260 
million) of  losses in 2011 alone.82 The total financial uninsured costs of  the 2007 floods were 
estimated to be £4 billion.83 The heatwave of  2003 was estimated to have cost £500 million 
to the economy.84 The CCRA suggests that the combined annual average domestic and 
commercial flood insurance claims could increase to between £700 million to £1 billion by the 
2080s.85

224.  If  businesses can manage these risks with minimal disruption and revenue loss, they will 
be better able to maintain a competitive position. This message is reinforced by the Prince 
of  Wales’s UK Corporate Leaders Group, which has endorsed the case for mainstreaming 
business continuity planning so that it is responsive to the challenges ahead.86 It is also 
supported by the Confederation of  British Industry (CBI).


CBI


The CBI believes that meeting the challenges of  climate change is not just about addressing 
risk. It is also about cultivating opportunity. It makes sense for individual businesses to start to 
incorporate changes in the climate into their own planning. For example, increasing the flood 
resilience of  buildings, infrastructure and homes reduces the immediate costs of  insuring 
vulnerable assets at a premium.

In addition, establishing leadership in the development of  new adaptation technologies and 
expertise will also carve out new export opportunities for UK businesses in a growing 
international market.

225.  Secondly, organisations will benefit from capitalising on business opportunities that arise 
from the need to manage the risks from climate change and extreme weather events. There 
is potential for growth in this area of  the UK economy. A report produced by k-Matrix on 
‘Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change activities in the UK and global economy’ 
forecasts average annual growth of  over 5% up to 2017/18 where the forecast series ends.87

226.  Further research about the risks and opportunities for businesses is needed to help support 
future economic growth. A particularly important area is that of  supply chains and their role 
in delivering productivity and growth. Climate change impacts that occur abroad will bring 
additional threats and opportunities to the UK economy because of  the nature of  international 
supply chains.

227.  The climate-related risks faced by businesses include flooding (direct damage to assets and 
indirect damage via supply chain disruption), threats to water availability and overheating of  
premises.88 Other priority risks from the CCRA are summarised in the table below.

CCRA Risk Description

228.  Evidence from Ipsos Mori (2013) shows that the number of  businesses saying that they are 
taking action to adapt to climate change has increased significantly from around 1 in 4 (24%) 
in 2009 to around 1 in 3 (34%) of  the businesses surveyed in 2012.89 Large businesses are 
most likely to be taking action compared to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). The 
same research shows that most (76%) of  the businesses surveyed would act if  it saved them 
money, but also that there is sometimes confusion about what adaptation means. This points 
to the need to further raise awareness about adaptation and also about how good climate risk 
management can save money.

229.  In 2012 Defra commissioned the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) to gather evidence of  how 
UK businesses are adapting to climate change.90 The main findings are:

 •  whilst 80% of  responding FTSE100 companies identified substantive risks to their business 
due to climate change, less than 50% incorporated climate change adaptation into their 
businesses strategies

 •  there is a marked diversity between attitudes and approaches to risk and adaptation needs 
in different business sectors, e.g. the term ‘adaptation’ is rarely understood.

230.  The CDP will consider including more specific questions around adaptation strategies in 
future questionnaires for major businesses, with a focus on the cost of  adaptation and 
potential liabilities from climate risks.

231.  It is up to businesses to decide individually what level of  risk they can accept. However, 
there are issues to address. An analytical paper ‘The Economics of  the National Adaptation 
Programme’ published by Defra explores this further. While it is important for the government 
to help remove barriers to action, policy should be developed in such a way that does not 
crowd out private investment in adaptation and keeps a clear focus on cost-effectiveness.

232.  The government has a role in helping businesses to understand the potential risks and 
opportunities through developing and disseminating information and tools. The government 
will also encourage businesses to review their strategic frameworks and models, promote 
knowledge sharing in areas of  good practice (eg flexibility to prevent irreversible decision-
making) and target support for those sectors facing the highest risks or greatest barriers 
to adaptation.

233.  Much of  the government’s work to raise awareness and increase understanding in the 
private sector is being led by the EA Climate Ready Support Service working in partnership 
with trade and professional bodies. In addition, the Cabinet Office has produced a guide 
for SMEs called ‘Business Continuity for Dummies’ and work by Institute for Environmental 
Management and Assessment (IEMA) is helping build capacity in businesses through 
increasing adaptation skills, professional competences and the use of  standards.

Climate Ready Support for Businesses

The EA is working with the Continuity Forum and the British Standards Institution (BSI) to 
monitor and review uptake and use of  extreme weather and climate change requirements in 
appropriate standards and accreditations used in continuity planning. The work will encourage 
businesses to increase their use of  existing standards and accreditations for the wider benefit of  
preparing for a changing climate.

The EA is also working with Climate UK to roll out a Business Resilience Health Check tool 
to help businesses in supply chains and SMEs adapt to climate change. The process tool is 
designed to help identify the parts of  a business most vulnerable to extreme weather and climate 
change, and will prompt action. The next step is to increase awareness of  the health check tool 
at a national level, such as through trade bodies.

role to help businesses to be aware of  these opportunities.

Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) and Climate North East collaboration

The FSB has been working collaboratively with Climate North East (linked to Climate UK). In 
recognition of  the range of  businesses that contribute to climate resilience and the low carbon 
economy, both parties collaborated to organise the first ‘Big Eco Show’ in September 2012. 
The business community has welcomed such events as they provide a catalyst to make genuine 
trade connections, to collaborate and gain inspiration and inspire adaptation action.

235.  Encouragingly, a number of  development banks are taking climate change adaptation into 
consideration when financing major infrastructure projects both in the UK and across Europe. 
These include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European 
Investment Bank and the newly formed UK Green Investment Bank. This helps to create the 
right sort of  investment climate for those companies who are managing their own risks, or are 
helping to manage risks to other organisations.

The UK Green Investment Bank (GIB)

The GIB will help accelerate additional capital for infrastructure. It is incorporating climate 
change resilience into its sustainability and green impact policies and considering climate 
resilience in its investment decision making as part of  its standard technical and green risk 
assessment processes. Where appropriate the bank will commission external assessment 
of  the scale and nature of  the extreme weather and climate risks associated with proposed 
investments.

Domestic opportunities

236.  Defra is collaborating with the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) to fund successful bids from 
a design competition to develop innovative solutions for adaptation in infrastructure. This 
fulfils a commitment in the 2011 National Infrastructure Plan.91 As a result, the competition is 
supporting the development of  3 innovative solutions: a stackable flood barrier, a zero-energy 
rainwater harvester, and catchment scale modelling to improve urban drainage systems 
design. The competition will help to bring innovative climate resilience products and services 
to market. A second stage of  the design competition will run from 2013.92

237.  The academic community is also playing its part in the global knowledge and expertise 
economy, where programmes such as LWEC are bringing together academia and industry to 
target adaptation products and services or to simply explore adaptation innovations.93

238.  The changing climate may change tourism patterns. English Heritage has recognised the 
risks and has recently produced a bulletin that sets out the risks faced by heritage assets and 
the direction of  travel. It is working in partnership with others, such as E.ON to manage the 
risks.94 In addition, the report ‘England: A Strategic Framework for Tourism 2010 – 2020’ from 
Visit England identifies the need to address the implications of  climate change through its 
Wise Growth action plan.

239.  At the local level, local government is playing a pivotal role in developing Local Development 
Plans. These plans act as a catalyst for resilient economic growth in an area. EA Climate 
Ready will also support the LGA’s Climate Local initiative to signpost tools, guidance and 
evidence to support councils in working with local businesses on resilient economic growth. 
Climate UK will work with LEPs to raise awareness and support best practice in assessing 
and managing climate change risks and opportunities to the local economy. The Defra 
Network, including Natural England, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission and the 
Marine Management Organisation has also issued an offer to LEPs and to the City Deals 
process, to help LEPs protect the environment and promote growth, which is sustainable and 
resilient to a changing climate.95

Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)

LEPs are working with local authorities in Cheshire and Warrington, Greater Manchester, 
and Avonmouth Severnside to identify climate change risks to businesses and are reviewing 
adaptation strategies. The case study run by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority 
(GMCA) will identify climate change risks related to economic development priorities in the 
Greater Manchester Strategy, including transport infrastructure, housing development, town 
and regional centres, employment locations, energy infrastructure and science and innovation 
assets. This work will identify which economic development priorities are most at risk from 
climate change impacts and provide the framework for communicating with Defra partners in 
order to co-develop action to manage them.

The Greater London Authority (GLA) & the London Climate Change 
Partnership (LCCP)

The GLA, with LCCP, is undertaking a scoping study to understand the adaptation economy 
in London, through analysing the sub-sectors and identifying how the sector could and should 
develop, to meet future local, national and international demand. As a leading global city, London 
is ideally placed to market its adaptation know-how, products and services to a global and 
national audience. For example, the ‘adaptation and resilience’ sub-sector (which also includes 
activities not specifically addressing climate change) generated £12 billion in the UK in 2011/12. 
In the same period this sub-sector generated sales of  £2.5 billion in 2011-12 in London. In the 
same period, the climate change element of  this sub-sector in London had a turnover of  £431 
million and employed nearly 4,000 people, demonstrating the potential for growth.

EU growth funding

240.  The government is currently developing the Structural and Investment Funds Growth 
Programme for England covering 2014 to 2020. The programme will set out how EU funds 
will be used to drive growth across the country, in line with priorities developed by the LEPs 
through their Local Investment Strategies. As 1 of  11 thematic objectives of  the programme,

235.  Encouragingly, a number of  development banks are taking climate change adaptation into 
consideration when financing major infrastructure projects both in the UK and across Europe. 
These include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European 
Investment Bank and the newly formed UK Green Investment Bank. This helps to create the 
right sort of  investment climate for those companies who are managing their own risks, or are 
helping to manage risks to other organisations.

The UK Green Investment Bank (GIB)

The GIB will help accelerate additional capital for infrastructure. It is incorporating climate 
change resilience into its sustainability and green impact policies and considering climate 
resilience in its investment decision making as part of  its standard technical and green risk 
assessment processes. Where appropriate the bank will commission external assessment 
of  the scale and nature of  the extreme weather and climate risks associated with proposed 
investments.

Domestic opportunities

236.  Defra is collaborating with the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) to fund successful bids from 
a design competition to develop innovative solutions for adaptation in infrastructure. This 
fulfils a commitment in the 2011 National Infrastructure Plan.91 As a result, the competition is 
supporting the development of  3 innovative solutions: a stackable flood barrier, a zero-energy 
rainwater harvester, and catchment scale modelling to improve urban drainage systems 
design. The competition will help to bring innovative climate resilience products and services 
to market. A second stage of  the design competition will run from 2013.92

237.  The academic community is also playing its part in the global knowledge and expertise 
economy, where programmes such as LWEC are bringing together academia and industry to 
target adaptation products and services or to simply explore adaptation innovations.93

238.  The changing climate may change tourism patterns. English Heritage has recognised the 
risks and has recently produced a bulletin that sets out the risks faced by heritage assets and 
the direction of  travel. It is working in partnership with others, such as E.ON to manage the 
risks.94 In addition, the report ‘England: A Strategic Framework for Tourism 2010 – 2020’ from 
Visit England identifies the need to address the implications of  climate change through its 
Wise Growth action plan.

239.  At the local level, local government is playing a pivotal role in developing Local Development 
Plans. These plans act as a catalyst for resilient economic growth in an area. EA Climate 
Ready will also support the LGA’s Climate Local initiative to signpost tools, guidance and 
evidence to support councils in working with local businesses on resilient economic growth. 
Climate UK will work with LEPs to raise awareness and support best practice in assessing 
and managing climate change risks and opportunities to the local economy. The Defra 
Network, including Natural England, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission and the 
Marine Management Organisation has also issued an offer to LEPs and to the City Deals 
process, to help LEPs protect the environment and promote growth, which is sustainable and 
resilient to a changing climate.95

Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)

LEPs are working with local authorities in Cheshire and Warrington, Greater Manchester, 
and Avonmouth Severnside to identify climate change risks to businesses and are reviewing 
adaptation strategies. The case study run by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority 
(GMCA) will identify climate change risks related to economic development priorities in the 
Greater Manchester Strategy, including transport infrastructure, housing development, town 
and regional centres, employment locations, energy infrastructure and science and innovation 
assets. This work will identify which economic development priorities are most at risk from 
climate change impacts and provide the framework for communicating with Defra partners in 
order to co-develop action to manage them.

The Greater London Authority (GLA) & the London Climate Change 
Partnership (LCCP)

The GLA, with LCCP, is undertaking a scoping study to understand the adaptation economy 
in London, through analysing the sub-sectors and identifying how the sector could and should 
develop, to meet future local, national and international demand. As a leading global city, London 
is ideally placed to market its adaptation know-how, products and services to a global and 
national audience. For example, the ‘adaptation and resilience’ sub-sector (which also includes 
activities not specifically addressing climate change) generated £12 billion in the UK in 2011/12. 
In the same period this sub-sector generated sales of  £2.5 billion in 2011-12 in London. In the 
same period, the climate change element of  this sub-sector in London had a turnover of  £431 
million and employed nearly 4,000 people, demonstrating the potential for growth.

EU growth funding

240.  The government is currently developing the Structural and Investment Funds Growth 
Programme for England covering 2014 to 2020. The programme will set out how EU funds 
will be used to drive growth across the country, in line with priorities developed by the LEPs 
through their Local Investment Strategies. As 1 of  11 thematic objectives of  the programme,

an adaptation policy statement and guidance to LEPs will be developed to ensure that 
adaptation is embedded in the development and implementation of  local strategies. This 
will help ensure that measures that support both growth and adaptation are brought forward 
under the programme and that investments are resilient to climate change.

241.  Initial government guidance to LEPs recognises the potential for the Structural and Investment 
Funding to be used to manage flood risk where it can deliver economic growth. The 
government will consider this further as it develops more detailed guidance for LEPs and 
agrees the UK Partnership Agreement with the EU Commission.96, 97 LEPs have also been 
asked to consider the following adaptation measures in their investment strategies:

 •  capacity building within the LEPs and the social sector (acknowledging that climate change 
will have a disproportionate impact on the socially vulnerable)

 •  innovation in the growing adaptation goods and services market

 • business skills for managing risk

 •  green infrastructure which also addresses water and flood risks (particularly in high-risk 
areas or in new business parks) and resource efficiency

International opportunities

242.  A resilient UK business community will have more opportunities to compete internationally as 
resilience reinforces the reliability of  UK businesses in international supply chains if  they are 
at low risk of  causing disruption.

243.  Evidence suggests that adaptation goods and services is a growing international market. 
In 2010-11, the provision of  goods and services which improve adaptation and resilience to 
climate change in the UK was a £2.1 billion industry with over 21,000 employees. In the same 
period, global activities were worth an estimated £65.8 billion. This is an emerging market 
with a domestic growth rate of  3.9% for 2010-11 and a forecasted UK growth rate of  7.1% by 
2017-18.98

244.  The recent report to the government on ‘International threats and opportunities from climate 
change to the UK’ (ITOCC)99 highlighted, for example, the following trade opportunities and 
threats:

 •  Opportunities in increased potential to export UK adaptation goods and services and 
support physical and financial assets abroad due to economic damages from extreme 
weather where there are strong UK interests

 •  Threats in increased damages to physical and financial assets abroad due to economic 
damages from extreme weather and increased volatility in food prices

245.  This report contributes to our understanding of  the risks from climate change to UK interests 
overseas. It will supplement the existing body of  analysis that informs the government’s 
humanitarian, development and foreign policies and thus help the UK to better address the 
impacts of  climate change around the world.

246.  The FCO will use the report to support its international influencing strategy, which is designed 
to contribute to a change in the global political conditions and ambition required to achieve an 
agreement in 2015 on limiting global CO2 emissions. In particular the report will be used to 
support UK thinking on the potential economic costs to the UK and global economy of  failing 
to address climate change.

247.  UK Trade & Investment (UKTI), working with Foreign and Commonwealth (FCO) climate 
change attachés in overseas markets, identifies and facilitates international commercial 
opportunities for UK companies with adaptation expertise. This includes bringing UK 
experience to the attention of  the government decision-makers and private sector procurers. 
For example UKTI promotes the UK water industry privatised model as a sustainable solution 
in providing water and wastewater services. This includes reduced energy consumption 
through energy produced from wastewater treatment processes and reducing leakage and 
risk of  flooding while improving potable/grey and industrial water quality for re-use.

High Value Business Opportunities involving Thailand

The UK is continuing to position itself  as Thailand’s partner as it seeks to develop its water 
and flood management initiatives resulting from the 2011 floods. This is a high-value business 
opportunity (approx £1.9 billion). The government promotes and supports UK companies 
to access these opportunities either directly, by introducing UK companies to major project 
proponents and Defra partners, or indirectly by ensuring that the Thai authorities (and the 
appointed project business consortia) are aware of  UK capability as well as by supporting the 
Thai Government through capability building activities. A good example is the training provided  
to a number of  Thai government officials at Cranfield University on Flood Risk.

Focus area 3: Supply chains

Objective 26: To help businesses better understand and manage climate change risks to 
their supply chains.

248.  The CCRA highlighted a risk of  possible decreases in output for UK businesses due to an 
increase in supply chain disruption as a result of  extreme weather events.100 Recent weather 
events in the UK have tested the resilience of  domestic supply chains. Worldwide economic 
and natural shocks of  recent times such as volcanic ash clouds, tsunamis and earthquakes 
have also shown the fragility of  long distance and single-source supply chains.

249.  How supply chains are affected by these type of  events depends on a range of  factors. 
The recent ECR project explored these supply network issues further, and found that certain 
types of  supply chains are likely to be at high risk from climate change:101

 •  high complexity: where businesses are dependent on receiving large numbers of  
components from many organisations across a wide geographic area

 •  low substitutability: where inputs are specialised and where limited (or no) alternative 
sources exist

 •  low flexibility: where inventories are kept low due to a business model’s reliance on ‘just in 
time’ production

250.  To illustrate these findings, the ECR Business chapter investigated the supply chain 
interruption of  a large multinational original equipment manufacturer. Current preparations 
were inadequate, implying that there could be a substantial impact on business continuity 
and up to 6 months loss of  production. However, by taking appropriate adaptation action this 
could reduce to a short-term impact of  2 to 4 weeks. The ECR outlined that the cost saving of  
reducing shutdown time could be hundreds of  millions of  pounds.

251.  The ITOCC report provides important context for Defra’s work in looking at the global impacts 
on sustainability of  food supply. It builds on some of  the themes from the government’s 
Foresight report on the Future of  Food and farming and will be considered alongside other 
evidence in future policy development. In particular, Defra is scoping a project on global 
food modelling and research to compare existing models aimed at integrating environmental 
impacts (including climate change) with global agricultural production and international food 
security over the longer term and is working with other UK funders through the Global Food 
Security Programme to co-ordinate research (approx £400 million) and internationally through 
the EU Joint programming Initiative on Food, Agriculture and Climate change (JPI-FACCE), 
EuraNet Susfood programme and the Global Research Alliance to take a multi-disciplinary 
systems approach to a range of  global food security challenges. Please also see Chapter 5.

Report on International Threats and Opportunities of Climate Change in the 
UK – Food supply chains (Price Waterhouse Coopers)

PwC’s report to Defra shows that the UK is unlikely to experience food scarcity in the short term 
but supply disruptions in a major food producing country may lead to sharp rises in prices or 
temporary shortages of  particular foodstuffs. In the longer term, the change in availability of  
certain commodities may require switching of  trading partners away from current ones. This 
represents both opportunities and risks for businesses when managing growth in the sector.

252.  The government is providing clarity and building business confidence for investment and 
growth through its Industrial Strategy. This strategy will enhance investor confidence and 
growth and should help reduce the risks from international climate change impacts. Already, 
big global companies are increasingly showing a preference for co-locating important 
elements of  their supply chains with their UK manufacturing operations.

253.  As part of  the Industrial Strategy the government is focusing on building collaborative 
strategic partnerships with relevant major sectors. Some of  these may face serious impacts 
from a changing climate, most notably the ‘enabling sectors’, such as energy, construction 
and to some extent ‘knowledge-intensive services’, such as the information economy and 
‘advanced manufacturing’ such as automotive and aeronautical sectors.

254.  Through programmes such as the ‘Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative’ or the 
Manufacturing Advisory Service, BIS continues to give support to a range of  sectors. This 
often includes investment in capital equipment, associated research and development and 
improved skills and training support. This type of  support could also be relevant to suppliers 
and supply chains that need to adapt to a changing climate.

255.  The EA’s Climate Ready Support Service has developed guidance to help UK business 
supply chains understand and manage domestic and international climate change risks. The 
EA is also working with a number of  retail organisations to pilot the guidance and test how the 
retail supply chain can be made more resilient.

256.  Tomorrow’s Company has recently published a paper that considered the importance of  
partnerships and collaborations across business supply chains to help tackle climate change 
adaptation, and includes case studies on the benefits of  partnerships.102

257.  The role of  trade bodies to support all parties in supply networks is crucial. Examples of  the 
considerable amount of  work being carried out by these organisations are set out below.

Trade bodies

British Retail Consortium (BRC) has agreed a commitment on climate change adaptation with 
its members through its environment and sustainability initiative ‘A Better Retailing Climate’.103 

Actions by BRC members include:

•  examining climate related impacts on specific product categories (eg fresh food)

• setting targets to ensure that buildings have climate change mitigation plans

• constructing energy and water efficient stores

•  contributing to the Product Sustainability Forum convened by the Waste Resources Action 
Programme

•  working with suppliers and investing in research to ensure that farming and food supply 
chains are in a robust position to adapt in the future

EEF, the Manufacturers Organisation for UK Manufacturing, published ‘Be Prepared 
– Monitoring supply chains; Maximising resilience’104, advice which outlines steps for 
manufacturers to take to minimise exposure to future events.

EEF has also surveyed its members to assess resilience to recent extreme events. Local 
natural disasters, such as flooding or heavy snow, affected over 60% of  UK manufacturers with 
international impacts being felt too. Impacts can be especially acute for companies competing on 
the basis of  customer service, speed of  delivery and quality. Surveys results showed that 25% of  
UK manufacturers have begun to consider what a changing climate could mean for them, whilst 
50% have not yet considered it.

Food and Drink Federation has developed guidance, ‘Sustainable Sourcing: Five Steps 
Towards Managing Supply Chain Risk’, to help food businesses assess and respond to the 
pressures on the global food system coming from a range of  factors, including the impacts 
of  climate change. The guide explains how to map a supply chain, identify priority issues and 
devise action plans to address these. It complements FDF’s Every Last Drop guidance on 
managing water use along the supply chain. Over the course of  the next few years FDF will be 
developing a much more extensive web-based resource, providing up-to-date information on 
best practice and links to further advice.

Actions to address priority risks

Focus area 4: Maintaining growth through research and 
understanding

Objective 27: To undertake research to increase the understanding of climate change 
impacts on growth and the economy, working with investors, insurers and other 
industry partners.

258.  Climate change will have an impact on the global economy. Many models that seek to quantify 
the macroeconomic impact of  climate change conclude that the economic impact of  climate 
change will be relatively mild.105 However, in general these models fail to account adequately 
for low probability, high impact events and only focus on a limited number of  economic 
sectors.

259.  Recent research points towards potentially large, or even catastrophic, economic 
consequences if  low probability-high impact events occur.106 Many long term investors, such 
as pension and insurance providers, are concerned that we do not fully understand the effects 
of  climate change risk on future economic growth. The government therefore plans to work 
with long term investors to appraise current modelling techniques and better understand how 
extreme events may affect the UK economy.

260.  There is a need to improve understanding of  the impacts of  climate change on industries 
such as pension providers and insurance. This would better enable these industries to seize 
the growth opportunities that climate change provides and minimise the risks. The banking 
and insurance industries could help to raise awareness and encourage and support action 
amongst a wide variety of  organisations that they work with.

261.  Defra has published a pilot research project ‘The macroeconomics of  climate change’ to 
review the links between climate change and economic growth.107 In theory, the benefits 
of  adaptation can outweigh the costs. Economic growth should be greater with adaptation 
compared to business as usual if  we reduce climate risk as the net damages of  climate 
change should be lower.

256.  Tomorrow’s Company has recently published a paper that considered the importance of  
partnerships and collaborations across business supply chains to help tackle climate change 
adaptation, and includes case studies on the benefits of  partnerships.102

257.  The role of  trade bodies to support all parties in supply networks is crucial. Examples of  the 
considerable amount of  work being carried out by these organisations are set out below.

Trade bodies

British Retail Consortium (BRC) has agreed a commitment on climate change adaptation with 
its members through its environment and sustainability initiative ‘A Better Retailing Climate’.103 

Actions by BRC members include:

•  examining climate related impacts on specific product categories (eg fresh food)

• setting targets to ensure that buildings have climate change mitigation plans

• constructing energy and water efficient stores

•  contributing to the Product Sustainability Forum convened by the Waste Resources Action 
Programme

•  working with suppliers and investing in research to ensure that farming and food supply 
chains are in a robust position to adapt in the future

EEF, the Manufacturers Organisation for UK Manufacturing, published ‘Be Prepared 
– Monitoring supply chains; Maximising resilience’104, advice which outlines steps for 
manufacturers to take to minimise exposure to future events.

EEF has also surveyed its members to assess resilience to recent extreme events. Local 
natural disasters, such as flooding or heavy snow, affected over 60% of  UK manufacturers with 
international impacts being felt too. Impacts can be especially acute for companies competing on 
the basis of  customer service, speed of  delivery and quality. Surveys results showed that 25% of  
UK manufacturers have begun to consider what a changing climate could mean for them, whilst 
50% have not yet considered it.

Food and Drink Federation has developed guidance, ‘Sustainable Sourcing: Five Steps 
Towards Managing Supply Chain Risk’, to help food businesses assess and respond to the 
pressures on the global food system coming from a range of  factors, including the impacts 
of  climate change. The guide explains how to map a supply chain, identify priority issues and 
devise action plans to address these. It complements FDF’s Every Last Drop guidance on 
managing water use along the supply chain. Over the course of  the next few years FDF will be 
developing a much more extensive web-based resource, providing up-to-date information on 
best practice and links to further advice.

Focus area 4: Maintaining growth through research and 
understanding

Objective 27: To undertake research to increase the understanding of climate change 
impacts on growth and the economy, working with investors, insurers and other 
industry partners.

258.  Climate change will have an impact on the global economy. Many models that seek to quantify 
the macroeconomic impact of  climate change conclude that the economic impact of  climate 
change will be relatively mild.105 However, in general these models fail to account adequately 
for low probability, high impact events and only focus on a limited number of  economic 
sectors.

259.  Recent research points towards potentially large, or even catastrophic, economic 
consequences if  low probability-high impact events occur.106 Many long term investors, such 
as pension and insurance providers, are concerned that we do not fully understand the effects 
of  climate change risk on future economic growth. The government therefore plans to work 
with long term investors to appraise current modelling techniques and better understand how 
extreme events may affect the UK economy.

260.  There is a need to improve understanding of  the impacts of  climate change on industries 
such as pension providers and insurance. This would better enable these industries to seize 
the growth opportunities that climate change provides and minimise the risks. The banking 
and insurance industries could help to raise awareness and encourage and support action 
amongst a wide variety of  organisations that they work with.

261.  Defra has published a pilot research project ‘The macroeconomics of  climate change’ to 
review the links between climate change and economic growth.107 In theory, the benefits 
of  adaptation can outweigh the costs. Economic growth should be greater with adaptation 
compared to business as usual if  we reduce climate risk as the net damages of  climate 
change should be lower.

262.  The project report concludes that further research is necessary to quantify the value of  
adaptation at the macroeconomic level. A disconnection exists between the latest advances 
in academic research and the latest model development. Macroeconomic models of  climate 
change are therefore not yet useful to inform government policy. In response, the government 
will be developing well-informed policy questions to help guide future research into this area.

Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC)

IIGCC believes that climate change presents major long-term risks to the global economy and is 
likely to have substantial impacts on investments in the decades ahead. This will occur through 
direct impacts on UK assets (eg commercial real estate). However, potentially more significant 
are the impacts on investments outside the UK and impacts on the international assets and 
supply chains of  UK companies. The IIGCC is concerned that climate impacts could be more 
severe and rapid than previously assumed and about the potential for climate change to 
exacerbate other problems via the energy-food-water nexus. IIGCC believes that well-designed 
climate change and clean energy policies will mitigate these risks and also present significant 
opportunities for investors. It is also important that adaptation measures that reduce unavoidable 
climate impacts are implemented.

Vision: “Local Government plays a central role in leading and supporting local places to become 
more resilient to a range of  future risks and to be prepared for the opportunities from a changing 
climate”.

263.  The impacts of  extreme weather and climate change will vary from location to location. 
The risks and opportunities highlighted in the CCRA will therefore, in many cases, need to be 
managed locally.

264.  As providers of  important services and as community leaders, local councils will play a pivotal 
role in leading, supporting and driving delivery of  many actions highlighted throughout this 
report. There is also a crosscutting role for councils in supporting local adaptation action. In 
recognition of  this, local government representatives, through the Local Adaptation Advisory 
Panel (see LAAP box below) have helped steer the development of  this chapter.

Local Adaptation Advisory Panel for England

The LAAP has been set up to provide advice to central government from a local perspective, 
enhancing the capacity of  local leadership to help build resilience. It will develop strong links with 
other important national partners and networks to remove barriers to adaptation and help shape 
a fully supportive framework for local adaptation. Many councils already have their own plans 
to adapt to a changing climate. LAAP’s role is to support local ambition, identify and share best 
practice and be an influential voice to government to ensure there is the right level of  support to 
local needs. They will provide advice on how this work benefits business, residents and supports 
economic prosperity.

265.  The actions highlighted in this report should be considered in the context of  the Localism 
Act 2011, which gives local government new freedoms, flexibilities and responsibilities. 
In particular, the Act provides for a ‘general power of  competence’. This means that local 
councils may do anything that individuals generally may do unless it is expressly prohibited, 
restricted or limited. This will enable local councils to work together with businesses, 
communities and other councils to drive down costs while meeting local needs and priorities.

266.  Councils manage a range of  climate risks relating to their estates and the services they 
provide. They work with local communities and businesses to increase resilience. These risks 
are cross-cutting. This is reflected in the local government objectives below.

267.  The cross-cutting objectives in this chapter were drafted for councils and their partners, 
in consultation with LAAP. They fall into 2 broad categories:

 • raising awareness, building capability and making the case for action

 •  providing a framework for action

Focus Area 1: Raising awareness, building capability and 
making the case for action

Objective 28: To raise and maintain the profile of adaptation with local authorities 
and promote action to embed climate resilience across local authority services and 
responsibilities.

Objective 29: To support local government to build a credible business case for action 
and take well-informed decisions both internally across service areas and externally with 
their local communities and businesses.

268.  In May 2012, government ministers and local authority elected members jointly recognised 
the importance of  local adaptation action at a summit meeting (see box below). They also 
recognised the need for central and local government to continue to work together to support 
locally led action which is set out in a commitment under Focus Area 2 below.

Raising Political Awareness (Joint LGA, Defra and DCLG summit of  24 May 2012)

Central government acknowledges the importance of  locally-led action on climate change to 
strengthen resilience to current and future climate risk. The government will work with the LGA to 
develop a framework for action that sets out a clear narrative on ways in which councils can build 
climate resilience.

Councils can help to increase the resilience of  local places and communities, including by:

•  building resilience into decisions on buildings, roads, businesses, parks and other public 
spaces

•  building resilience into key services such as social care, emergency planning and public 
health

•  making the best use of  land, assets, investments and maintenance spending to manage risk 
better

•  planning for the long term by reflecting climate risks and sustainable development in Local 
Plans

•  increasing organisational resilience to extreme weather by building climate change risks into 
corporate risk registers

•  supporting retrofitting, green-build and the design and management of  green spaces

•  encouraging local businesses to be climate ready to ensure they are resilient and competitive

269.  In order to build climate resilience, councils and partners have been working together to raise 
awareness of  adaptation. To complement this work, LAAP will develop a programme aiming 
to set out climate risks and good adaptation practice for a wide range of  councils across 
England. In order to do this, LAAP will use its existing networks and work with partners from 
across the government, LGA, Climate UK and the EA.

270.  One of  the main challenges for councils and partners is to raise awareness of  the need to 
make a strong economic and social case for action to address climate risks (including longer 
term risks) to council, business and community leaders. Building a clear business case 
and identifying projects with multiple benefits is therefore essential to ensure that the risks 
associated with a changing climate are effectively balanced against other priorities 
and pressures.

271.  The EA’s Climate Ready Support Service will support local councils and partners by 
developing tools and resources to help councils realise the benefits of  taking action to reduce 
risks and to exploit any economic opportunities.

272.  Sharing best practice is invaluable for demonstrating how climate resilience can be embedded 
across council business and managed as a part of  council risk management. This may 
encourage others to act. The LAAP provides a forum to champion adaptation activity across 
local government, identifying best practice and providing expert input to the development of  
tools and support available under the Climate Ready programme. The EA’s Climate Ready 
Support Service will also help build the capacity of  councils through the provision of  training 
and support materials.

Developing a business case for adaptation

The EA’s Climate Ready Support Service is:

•  making Kent County Council’s Severe Weather Impacts Monitoring System (SWIMS) 
accessible to all local authorities, which will help councils and their partners to record how 
their service delivery is affected by severe weather

•  developing a ‘Business Case for Adaptation’ which aims to complement existing climate 
change adaptation guidance for businesses and local authorities.

Objective 31: To support sector-led activities, which allow councils to make local 
commitments to address their own unique challenges and opportunities arising from a 
changing climate.

273.  A framework for local adaptation action must have flexibility to respond to local needs but also 
provide the coherence and clarity for local leaders to effectively prioritise action and develop 
partnerships.

274.  These partnerships may include Local Enterprise Partnerships (see Chapter 7), Local Nature 
Partnerships and Neighbourhood Planning Forums.108 Depending on local circumstances, 
such groups may allow councils to promote joint ownership and delivery of  adaptation actions 
with a wider range of  local Defra partners, communities and businesses.

275.  Current legislation and policy frameworks (see diagram below) allow councils to address 
climate risks. The government will continue to work with the local government sector on the 
adaptation policy framework to ensure it is joined up through liaison with the LAAP, the LGA, 
groups such as Core Cities and the EA’s Climate Ready Support Service.

276.  The government will also carry out an appropriate assessment of  vulnerability to the impacts 
of  climate change as part of  the assessment of  all new policies, programmes and projects, 
whether revenue, capital or regulatory109 and will ensure that any policy or initiative which 
increases the cost of  providing local authority services is properly assessed and fully funded 
by the relevant department.110

 Illustration of  range of  legislative and policy drivers that enable local action on climate adaptation

277.  A range of  local government-led initiatives are helping to build capacity on adaptation and to 
embed climate considerations in local thinking and decision making. This is acknowledged 
and supported by the government as a means for locally led action to strengthen resilience 
to current and future climate risk. For example, the LGA’s Climate Local initiative (see box 
below) and the NAP Cities Commitment comprising the 9 largest cities across England and 
developed as part of  the NAP both encourage and support local adaptation action, providing 
access to practical support and establishing networks to share learning.

278.  The LGA’s councillor-led Inland Flood Risk Management Group also provides support to 
councils on their role in reducing and managing flood risks.

Climate Local

Climate Local is an initiative to drive, inspire and support council action to reduce carbon 
emissions and to improve resilience to the impacts of  the changing climate. Launched in 2012, 
by the LGA, more than 60 councils have signed the Climate Local commitment. In signing 
up, individually or in partnership, councils make a public commitment to act on a set of  local 
priorities. They also agreed to support other councils by sharing details of  their actions and 
learning. Successes to date include:

•  West Sussex County Council used a risk assessment toolkit to understand the climate 
impacts on older residents and has redesigned its adult services to protect vulnerable people 
at risk from climate-related illnesses and death

•  Liverpool City Council is helping vulnerable communities to adapt, prepare and respond to 
flooding by piloting a Community Resilience Group led by community champions

•  Cheshire West and Chester Council are working with the Local Enterprise Partnership to improve 
business resilience at strategic growth sites. This will enable the economic development risks to be 
managed whilst highlighting any potential business opportunities a changing climate could bring.

Cities Commitment

More than 80% of  England’s people live in urban areas, where intricate systems of  
interdependent infrastructure and activity are especially sensitive to potential disruption from 
climate and weather impacts. Maintaining critical services and ensuring safety and prosperity 
will depend on the continuity of  those systems. When cities are competing for investment on the 
international stage they will come under increasing pressure to demonstrate long-term resilience. 
In recognition of  the need for concerted action among cities, London Councils, the Greater 
London Authority and the Group of  Core Cities have committed to working together to increase 
the resilience of  their city spaces (see their full agreement at the end of  the chapter).

275.  Current legislation and policy frameworks (see diagram below) allow councils to address 
climate risks. The government will continue to work with the local government sector on the 
adaptation policy framework to ensure it is joined up through liaison with the LAAP, the LGA, 
groups such as Core Cities and the EA’s Climate Ready Support Service.

276.  The government will also carry out an appropriate assessment of  vulnerability to the impacts 
of  climate change as part of  the assessment of  all new policies, programmes and projects, 
whether revenue, capital or regulatory109 and will ensure that any policy or initiative which 
increases the cost of  providing local authority services is properly assessed and fully funded 
by the relevant department.110

 Illustration of  range of  legislative and policy drivers that enable local action on climate adaptation

277.  A range of  local government-led initiatives are helping to build capacity on adaptation and to 
embed climate considerations in local thinking and decision making. This is acknowledged 
and supported by the government as a means for locally led action to strengthen resilience 
to current and future climate risk. For example, the LGA’s Climate Local initiative (see box 
below) and the NAP Cities Commitment comprising the 9 largest cities across England and 
developed as part of  the NAP both encourage and support local adaptation action, providing 
access to practical support and establishing networks to share learning.

278.  The LGA’s councillor-led Inland Flood Risk Management Group also provides support to 
councils on their role in reducing and managing flood risks.

Climate Local

Climate Local is an initiative to drive, inspire and support council action to reduce carbon 
emissions and to improve resilience to the impacts of  the changing climate. Launched in 2012, 
by the LGA, more than 60 councils have signed the Climate Local commitment. In signing 
up, individually or in partnership, councils make a public commitment to act on a set of  local 
priorities. They also agreed to support other councils by sharing details of  their actions and 
learning. Successes to date include:

•  West Sussex County Council used a risk assessment toolkit to understand the climate 
impacts on older residents and has redesigned its adult services to protect vulnerable people 
at risk from climate-related illnesses and death

•  Liverpool City Council is helping vulnerable communities to adapt, prepare and respond to 
flooding by piloting a Community Resilience Group led by community champions

•  Cheshire West and Chester Council are working with the Local Enterprise Partnership to improve 
business resilience at strategic growth sites. This will enable the economic development risks to be 
managed whilst highlighting any potential business opportunities a changing climate could bring.

Commitment to action by Core Cities, London Councils and 
the Greater London Authority (NAP Cities Commitment)

Cities face complex challenges in the face of  a changing climate. Higher population density, 
including a larger proportion of  vulnerable groups, concentrated assets, infrastructure, transport 
systems, buildings, schools, hospitals and businesses are expected to be acutely impacted by 
increased severity and frequency of  flooding, higher summer temperatures, heat waves, extreme 
weather events and increased pressure on water resources.

Core Cities (councils from Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, 
Nottingham and Sheffield), London Councils and the Greater London Authority (GLA) acknowledge 
that while city councils face significant budgetary constraints they play a key role in addressing 
risks from a changing climate.

Innovative solutions to the climate challenge

Core Cities, London Councils and the GLA commit, where local vulnerabilities and priorities 
dictate, to work together over the next 5 years with their partners, including central government, 
businesses, civil society and communities, to deliver innovative solutions to climate change, based 
on the following framework of  principles.

1) Embed climate risk management in the Built Environment by:

 •  consideration of  the potential for cities to demonstrate, how ‘sustainable development’  
– as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework – can be applied in a city context

 •  encouraging and supporting developers and their clients to factor in climate adaptation, 
drawing on case studies and best practice, for example from the Technology Strategy 
Board’s Design for Future Climate competition

 •  promoting collaboration with the academic community to develop innovative solutions and 
decision making

 •  exploring how action can be better targeted to localities and those in the community 
likely to be most at risk from climate impacts, for example through mapping and other 
spatial analysis

 •  promoting green and blue infrastructure in the context of  spatial planning, flood risk 
management responsibility within local government and Local Nature Partnerships, 
integrated with the work of  the sector led Green Infrastructure Partnership

 •  working with the government, during the review of  housing standards and planning 
guidance, to ensure appropriate consideration of  local impacts of  climate change

2) Strengthen the climate resilience of  infrastructure by:

 •  clarifying the relationship, with the government, between utilities, regulators, transport 
authorities and city councils to allow greater involvement in planning and managing local 
utility infrastructure

 •  closer working with Water UK, Ofwat and between water companies to allow closer working 
on approaches for water retention, water supply, treatment and re-circulation, to increase 
water efficiency and safeguard community wellbeing 

3) Address and build resilience to the Health and Wellbeing impacts of  climate change by:

 •  providing exemplars to demonstrate how the local health and social care system can build 
preparedness and resilience to the health risks, for example through the work of  the Health 
and Wellbeing Boards and Directors of  Public Health

 •  increasing understanding of  vulnerable groups by more effective working between councils, 
front line service providers and voluntary organisations. With assistance from currently 
available tools and guidance documents to reflect action needed to support them within 
council corporate plans and community ‘resilience’ plans

 •  promoting climate resilience within local communities, for example supporting initiatives 
from communities themselves and those organisations that work with them, for example 
flood forums and community groups

4) Address climate impacts on Business and Services by:

 •  working through existing relationships with businesses and community members to raise 
awareness and encourage actions to:

  – build long term resilience to a changing climate

  – promote innovation in the exploitation of  opportunities arising from climate change

 •  embedding consideration of  economic implications of  climate risks within the work 
programmes of  Local Enterprise Partnerships

 •  providing exemplars for local business by factoring in long term climate impacts into

  – council business continuity planning

  – council procurement contracts with suppliers

5)  Work jointly to develop a business case that increases understanding of  the benefits of  
early action, as well as the risks of  inaction, by the development of  a model approach to 
business case management. This will help make the case for resilience action, illustrate best 
practice methods and approaches for council members and Defra partners including civil 
society and business, and demonstrate the economic resilience of  cities.

Glossary of terms

Adaptation – a change in natural or human systems in response to the impacts of  climate change. 
These changes moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities and can be in response to actual 
or expected impacts. There are various types of  adaptation, such as: 

 •  Planned adaptation – the result of  a deliberate policy decision, and most likely include 
action that is required to return to, maintain, or achieve, a desired state. 

 • Maladaptation – could mean either:

  –  any changes in natural or human systems which inadvertently increase vulnerability to 
the hazards of  climate change; 

  –  an adaptation that does not succeed in reducing vulnerability but increases it instead; 

  –  spending a disproportionate amount of  effort and investment on adaptation beyond 
what is required. 

 •  No regret (adaptation) options – could be activities which would provide immediate economic 
and environmental benefits and continue to be worthwhile regardless of  future climate. They 
would be justified under all plausible future scenarios, including without climate change. 

Adaptive capacity – describes the ability of  a sector to design or implement effective adaptation 
measures, using information on possible future climate change and extreme weather to moderate 
potential damage, take advantage of  opportunities or to cope with the consequences. 

Natural Adaptive Capacity – describes the ability of  a species or natural system to adjust 
to climate change and extreme weather to moderate potential damage, to take advantage of  
opportunities or to cope with the consequences.

Baseline – a baseline is a state against which a change is measured. For example, a ‘current 
baseline’ is made up of  observable, present-day conditions. 

Capacity – is the combination of  all the strengths and resources available within a community, 
society or organisation which can reduce the level of  risk, or the effects of  a disaster. It can also be 
described as capability. 

Capacity building – in the context of  climate change, capacity building describes developing the 
right skills and capabilities to help countries adapt to climate change. This also includes helping 
them to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions. 

Climate – the climate can be described simply as the ‘average weather’, typically looked at 
over a period of  30 years. It can include temperature, rainfall, snow cover, or any other weather 
characteristic.

Climate Change – this refers to a change in the state of  the climate, which can be identified by changes 
in average climate characteristics which persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer.

Glossary of terms

Adaptation – a change in natural or human systems in response to the impacts of  climate change. 
These changes moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities and can be in response to actual 
or expected impacts. There are various types of  adaptation, such as: 

 •  Planned adaptation – the result of  a deliberate policy decision, and most likely include 
action that is required to return to, maintain, or achieve, a desired state. 

 • Maladaptation – could mean either:

  –  any changes in natural or human systems which inadvertently increase vulnerability to 
the hazards of  climate change; 

  –  an adaptation that does not succeed in reducing vulnerability but increases it instead; 

  –  spending a disproportionate amount of  effort and investment on adaptation beyond 
what is required. 

 •  No regret (adaptation) options – could be activities which would provide immediate economic 
and environmental benefits and continue to be worthwhile regardless of  future climate. They 
would be justified under all plausible future scenarios, including without climate change. 

Adaptive capacity – describes the ability of  a sector to design or implement effective adaptation 
measures, using information on possible future climate change and extreme weather to moderate 
potential damage, take advantage of  opportunities or to cope with the consequences. 

Natural Adaptive Capacity – describes the ability of  a species or natural system to adjust 
to climate change and extreme weather to moderate potential damage, to take advantage of  
opportunities or to cope with the consequences.

Baseline – a baseline is a state against which a change is measured. For example, a ‘current 
baseline’ is made up of  observable, present-day conditions. 

Capacity – is the combination of  all the strengths and resources available within a community, 
society or organisation which can reduce the level of  risk, or the effects of  a disaster. It can also be 
described as capability. 

Capacity building – in the context of  climate change, capacity building describes developing the 
right skills and capabilities to help countries adapt to climate change. This also includes helping 
them to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions. 

Climate – the climate can be described simply as the ‘average weather’, typically looked at 
over a period of  30 years. It can include temperature, rainfall, snow cover, or any other weather 
characteristic.

Climate Change – this refers to a change in the state of  the climate, which can be identified by changes 
in average climate characteristics which persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer.

 •  UKCP09 – The UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) provide plausible future projections of  
climate change for different time periods and different possible scenarios of  greenhouse gas 
emissions. These represent plausible scenarios illustrating a range of  possible future changes.

Resilience – describes the ability of  a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while 
retaining the same basic ways of  functioning, and a capacity to adapt to stress and change.

Risk – combines the chance that an event will occur with how large its impact could be, in social, 
economic or environmental terms. For example: the costs of  damage, number of  people affected or 
areas of  land affected by a specific climate effect. 

Risk Assessment – is an analysis of  risks and their impacts to provide information for decision 
making. Often, risk assessment will consider a particular impacted [party], like a building or 
population. The process usually includes identifying hazards which could have an impact; and 
assessing the likelihoods and severities of  impacts.

Risk Management – putting in place plans to avoid unacceptable consequences of  risks. 

Scenario – a scenario is a plausible description of  a possible future state of  the world. These use 
specific assumptions on how aspects of  the world might change, like economies, social trends, 
changes in technology, environmental changes, etc., based upon the best understanding available. 
These can include:

 •  Socio-economic scenario – is a plausible description of  the future population, Gross 
Domestic Product and other socio-economic aspects. 

 •  Climate Change Scenario – is a plausible description of  the change in climate by a 
certain time in the future. These scenarios are developed using models of  the Earth’s 
climate. Climate models and are based upon scientific understanding of  the way that the 
land, ocean and atmosphere interact and their responses to factors that can influence 
climate in the future, such as greenhouse gas emissions.

Sensitivity – in this context, the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or 
beneficially, by climate variability or change. 

Severe weather – refers to any dangerous meteorological phenomena with the potential to cause 
damage, serious social disruption, or loss of  human life.

Stakeholder – People, including organisations, who have an investment, financial or otherwise,  
in the consequences of  any decisions taken. 

Sustainable – referring to buildings, ecosystems, businesses, etc, which have a capacity to 
endure, over the longer term and in spite of  change. This is in the context of  environment/social/
economic influences.

Climate space – the area of  land which is climatically suitable for a particular species or habitat.

Confidence – in a scientific context, confidence describes the extent to which the findings of  an 
assessment are considered valid, based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of  evidence.

Ecosystem Services – the benefits to society from resources and processes provided by 
ecosystems can be described as ecosystem services. These can include: pollination and disease 
control, providing food and fuel, regulating the flow of  water through land to both prevent flooding 
and filter clean drinking water, and the aesthetic and amenity value of  the countryside.

Extreme weather – includes unusual, severe or unseasonal weather; or weather at the extremes 
of  the range of  weather seen in the past.

Greenhouse gases – a number of  gases whose presence in the atmosphere traps energy 
radiated by the Earth. This is called the greenhouse effect. These gases can be produced through 
natural or human processes. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. Other gases 
are: methane, fluorinated gases, ozone and nitrous oxide.

Hazard – a situation or event which could cause harm. A hazard does not necessarily cause harm.

Impact – in the context of climate change, an effect of climate change (eg flooding, rails buckling, etc.). 
See consequence. 

Likelihood – the chance of  an event or outcome occurring, usually expressed as a probability. 

Mitigation – describes action to reduce the likelihood of  an event occurring or reduce the impact if  
it does occur. This can include reducing the causes of  climate change (eg emission of  greenhouse 
gases); as well as reducing future risks associated with climate change.

Model – in its broadest sense, a model is a representation of  how a system works and can be used 
to understand how the system will respond to inputs and other changes.

Probability – is used to describe the chance or relative frequency of  particular types of  event 
occurring. It can also include sequences or combinations of  such events. 

Projection – any plausible description of  the future and the pathway that leads to it. A specific 
interpretation of  a ‘climate projection,’ refers to an estimate of  future climate developed using 
models of  the Earth’s climate. Projections are not predictions. Projections include assumptions, 
for example, on future socio-economic and technological developments, which might or might not 
happen. They therefore come with some uncertainties.
