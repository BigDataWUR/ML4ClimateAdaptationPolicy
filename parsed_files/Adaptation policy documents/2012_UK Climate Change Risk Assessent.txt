Faced with these uncertainties, but also in the knowledge that our climate is changing, and is fundamental 
to our lives and our livelihoods, the Government’s response is outlined below. There are five key steps:

1.  Minimise the risk of significant climate change. This is why the UK is committed to cutting 
its greenhouse gas emissions, and is playing a leading role at an international level, working 
with the EU, G20/G8 and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to reach a global 
agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Domestically, the Climate Change Act 2008 
aims to encourage the transition to a low carbon economy in the UK through unilateral legally-
binding emission reduction targets.

2.  Accept that despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, current and historic 
emissions mean that a certain amount of warming is inevitable. Mitigation efforts will help 
to limit the rise in temperatures and the potential scale of any impacts, however, some increases 
are now unavoidable. The UK will therefore need to adapt to changes in climate notwithstanding 
reductions in emissions. 

3.  Better understand vulnerability to our current climate. In recent years the UK has experienced 
high financial costs and societal and environmental impacts resulting from extreme weather 
events, such as flooding, unusually cold and severe winters and warmer than average summers 
including heatwaves. This has highlighted the fact that aspects of the UK economy and society 
are already vulnerable to extreme weather events. Climate change is expected to increase the 
frequency and severity of such events, creating a strong economic case for increasing the UK’s 
resilience and protecting the most vulnerable.

4.  Use the best science and evidence to understand the range of climate changes we 
might face, and what effect they might have on our economy, environment and society. 
Understanding these climate change risks is why the UK Government and Devolved Governments 
commissioned an independent report to help the UK understand what changes could lie ahead 
and how large an effect they could have: this is the Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA).

5.  Assess – using a risk-based approach – what we can put in place now, and plan for in 
the future, to increase the resilience of our economy, environment and society. Following 
the publication of this CCRA, and building on current policies, the Government will be leading 
the development of a National Adaptation Programme (NAP), covering England and reserved, 
excepted and non-devolved matters, to be published in 2013. 

The UK Government’s programme of work on adaptation is being co-ordinated by the Department for 
the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), and is defined in statute (The Climate Change Act 
2008). The Devolved Governments are responsible for delivery of adaptation work as defined by the 
respective devolution settlements.

1.2. What is the Legislative Framework?
The Climate Change Act 2008 makes the UK the first country in the world to have a legally-binding 
long-term framework to cut greenhouse gas emissions and a framework for building the UK’s ability to 
adapt to a changing climate. The strength of the Government’s response lies in this dual, ‘no regrets’ 
approach. The Act requires:

• A UK-wide climate change risk assessment (CCRA) that must take place every five years; 

•  A national adaptation programme (NAP) which must be put in place and reviewed every five 
years, setting out the Government’s objectives, proposals and policies for responding to the risks 
identified in the CCRA; 

•  Adaptation Reporting Powers (not applicable in Northern Ireland) which enable the Secretary of 
State to direct “reporting authorities” to prepare climate change adaptation reports. 

In addition, the Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, an independent expert 
body, was set up as required under the Climate Change Act 2008. Its role is to advise on the preparation 
of the UK CCRA, to report to Parliament on the UK Government’s progress in the implementation of the 
NAP and to provide advice to the Devolved Governments, as required.

The Adaptation Sub-Committee has provided valuable input and advice on the UK CCRA, helping in 
development of the methodology and in evaluating emerging results from the analysis. We are grateful 
for their input and support throughout this process.

Climate Change Risk Assessment

The Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) 2012 is the first assessment of its kind for the UK and 
the first in a five year cycle. This CCRA has assessed (and where possible monetised) the main risks 
and opportunities in the UK from climate change. This independent analysis provides an overview 
and assessment of risks in and across sectors, and will enable comparison between different sectors. 
It provides underpinning evidence that can be used by central Government to help inform priorities 
for action and appropriate adaptation measures. It also highlights where more work is needed to 
understand the scale and nature of the risks, and to help us consider what action – if any – we need 
to take.

The CCRA will be followed by the NAP, which will include appropriate economic analysis to inform 
Government about the costs and benefits of a number of options for adaptation to climate change.

National Adaptation Programme

The CCRA is the first step towards the delivery of a NAP, providing a key component of the underpinning 
evidence. 

The NAP, like the CCRA, will be reviewed and updated on a five yearly basis. Building on the CCRA and 
later economic analysis, the aim of the first NAP, which we plan to publish in 2013, will be to articulate 
the scale and nature of the adaptation challenge, to describe the respective roles of Government, 
private sector and others in meeting these challenges, and to set out Government’s adaptation policies 
and actions. For Government, the principles for dealing with adaptation will be to act mainly where 
the market is unlikely to act, to help others make good decisions on climate risks and opportunities 
(for example from investments in cutting edge science and decision support), and to promote risk-

based decision approaches (for example early action on decisions with long-term consequences, and 
maintaining flexibility by avoiding technical lock-in). 

On the first NAP, the UK Government’s intention is to work with others in a collaborative approach to 
policy making – to co-create with relevant organisations, and seek to achieve a high-degree of consensus 
on this programme.

Adaptation Reporting Power

The Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP) enables the Secretary of State to direct “reporting authorities” 
(companies with functions of a public nature such as water and energy utilities) to prepare climate 
change adaptation reports on how they are assessing and acting on the risks and opportunities from a 
changing climate. The first round of the ARP has now been concluded and 91 organisations have been 
directed to report, alongside 14 organisations reporting on a voluntary basis. A summary of the key 
findings from the first round of the ARP will be published shortly. These reports provide us with further 
evidence of organisational capacity in areas critical to our national infrastructure, and environment, and 
will help, alongside the CCRA and other evidence, to inform the development of the NAP.

1.3. What is the CCRA in detail?
The CCRA brings together a wide range of evidence about climate risks including the UK Climate 
Projections 2009 (UKCP09), stakeholder workshops, the findings from other Government reports, peer-
reviewed literature and new analysis completed as part of the CCRA project. 

This independent analysis was funded by UK Government and Devolved Governments and has been 
delivered through a consortium of organisations led by HR Wallingford. The outputs have been extensively 
peer reviewed by scientific and economics experts, an independent international peer review panel, and 
have also been scrutinised by the Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change. 

The methodology is novel in that it has allowed us to compare over 100 risks (prioritised from an 
initial list of over 700) from a number of disparate sectors, based on the magnitude of the impact and 
confidence in the evidence base. A key strength of the analysis is using a consistent method and set 
of climate projections to look at current and future risks and opportunities. Also, the method focuses 
attention on risks where decisions need to be made in the near future (i.e. in the next five years). 

To provide a baseline that can be more easily used to assess the effectiveness of actions or policy 
interventions, with the exception of a few specific cases, the CCRA does not build in societal change 
in assessing future risks, either from non-climate related change (e.g. in demographics, technology, 
economic growth), or responses to climate risks (e.g. Government policy, or private adaptation 
investment)2. For example, the CCRA shows us that without any current or planned action there are 
significant risks to parts of our infrastructure. However, Government and other key organisations are 
already taking action in many areas to minimise risks: our existing policies on for example flood defence, 
proposed policies in the Water White Paper, and plans by others, such as the energy generators and 
water companies to protect key assets such as power stations. Many current Government policies are 
highlighted in this report.

2 See Section 2.1. for more detail and individual Sector reports.

Fundamental change will require fundamental thinking – and this is the start of the process. Government 
will need to consider the wealth of information and analysis in these and other reports, consider 
actions and policies already in place where they have deliberately not been considered as part of 
the CCRA analysis, test the conclusions with a range of organisations throughout the UK, and 
work with them on understanding where the priorities are for immediate decisions and for further work 
and research.

This CCRA has mainly examined the risks of a changing climate in the UK – not to the UK from abroad. 
Given that global climatic events already affect the UK significantly, the future international impacts 
of climate change may disrupt the UK economy through impacts on traded goods, supply chains, 
migration and international relations. However, there is very little analysis on the scale and likelihood of 
such changes. As a starting point, the Foresight Report, International Dimensions of Climate Change3, 
looked at the existing evidence and identified a large number of international risks that could affect 
the UK, as well as some opportunities. The more recent Met Office report, Climate: Observations, 
Projections and Impacts4, funded by DECC, also considered, at a high level, the scale of potential 
climate threats and opportunities across a number of countries in different regions. Further work needs 
to be done on international risks to the UK and the NAP will take the state of knowledge on impacts of 
climate change globally into account.

Government also carries out a number of other types of risk assessment. While the CCRA focuses on 
risks from climate change and over a long time period (up to 2100), specifically providing underpinning 
evidence to support short and long term decisions on adaptation policies and actions, other assessments 
are directed to delivering different information to support Government decisions on specific issues. For 
example, the National Risk Assessment (NRA) assesses the main threats and hazards to the UK over a  
five year period, and drives contingency planning for responding to and recovering from civil emergencies; 
and the National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) identifies and assesses a wide range of risks to enable 
Ministers to prioritise the most significant risks which could threaten our national security interests.

2.  What is in the Climate Change Risk Assessment?

 The CCRA has been an ambitious undertaking – covering analysis of key risks and opportunities across 
all sectors of our economy at the national level. There is a large amount of material and data, but most 
organisations will want to access and consider only parts of it that are relevant to them. 

The UK Government will be working with stakeholders, in developing the NAP, to help develop an 
understanding of risks relevant to them, using the CCRA as a starting point for discussions.

The main CCRA reports include:

• The ‘UK Climate Change Risk Assessment Evidence Report’

• Reports for each of the eleven sectors 

• Reports for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland

Evidence for the assessment has been gathered in eleven sectors: Agriculture; Biodiversity & Ecosystem 
Services; Built Environment; Business, Industry & Services; Energy; Floods & Coastal Erosion; Forestry; 
Health; Marine & Fisheries; Transport; Water. The sector reports describe a wide range of potential risks 
in each sector, followed by a more detailed analysis of selected risks that were judged to be the most 
important.

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment Evidence Report brings together an overview of climate 
change risks and opportunities based on the analyses described in the Sector Reports and other sources 
of information. It is intended to provide information to policy makers on the vulnerability of the UK and 
future risks and opportunities due to climate change. 

The results of the assessment are presented in the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment Evidence Report 
in five themes: 

• Agriculture & Forestry; 

• Business; 

• Health & Wellbeing; 

• Buildings & Infrastructure; and 

• Natural Environment. 

Climate change risks in each theme are presented in terms of the range of potential magnitude of the 
risk, how magnitude varies over time and the overall confidence in the findings of the assessment. 

The reports for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland provide an assessment of climate change 
risks and opportunities in each country. They are based on the UK-wide sector reports but take account 
of risks that are particular to each country, such as marine water quality in Northern Ireland, changes in 
the timing of snow melt in Scotland and grassland productivity in Wales. 

2.1. What are the Uncertainties in the analysis?
There is strong scientific evidence that climate change will disrupt the global economy, environment 
and society due to projected warming, sea level rise and changes in global rainfall/snowfall patterns and 
extreme events. Scientists are confident that average UK temperatures will continue to rise, but it is less 
clear how other climate variables will change as a result, and therefore the assessment of future climate 
risks needs to take account of a wide range of outcomes, as well as highlighting those risks which 
are so uncertain that it isn’t possible currently to provide any evidence on the direction or magnitude 
of change.

The CCRA considered a range of potential changes in climate, informed by the UK Climate Projections 
2009 (UKCP09), to provide an indication of these uncertainties. This is reflected in both the magnitude 
ranges, and how these change with time, as described in the UK CCRA Evidence Report. It is important 
to acknowledge that changes to climate may occur outside the range considered in this analysis, and 
that new science may change plausible ranges. The confidence ratings used in the report illustrate 
the strength of evidence and consensus related to the direction and magnitude of different risks 
and opportunities.

Although new risks and opportunities may emerge over the next 100 years, there is considerable 
uncertainty related to when these may occur and therefore the most effective timing of any policy 
intervention. Continued monitoring of climate risks and opportunities, and future re-assessments of 
the risks from climate change will provide updated evidence about the timing of important risks and 
opportunities and the need for adaptation action. This is captured in the five year cycles of the Climate 
Change Act 2008.

The CCRA used the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) for three time periods – 30-year periods  
centred on the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. These may be interpreted as ‘short-term’, ‘medium-term’ and  
‘long-term’ respectively. For the marine environment, UKCP09 projections were only available for a 
‘medium emissions’ scenario, and one future time period (the 2080s).

Many key risks are not caused directly by the climate itself, but by changes in the biophysical impacts 
of climate change, for example sea level rise and flooding. In addition, many potential risks arise as a 
result of complex processes in which climate change is just one component. In a few cases the CCRA 
has considered different rates of population growth, which influence the number of people exposed 
to hazards like flooding and heatwaves. To minimise analytical complexity, however, with the exception 
of these few specific cases, the CCRA does not build in societal change in assessing future risks, either 
from non-climate related change (e.g. in demographics, technology, economic growth), or responses to 
climate risks (e.g. Government policy, or private adaptation investment)5. For example, in the flood risk 
sector, the assessment assumed that the Government would only continue to maintain existing flood 
defences, and did not consider any further future flood risk management measures that may be put in 
place. In the water sector it was only assumed that household demand for water would decline to meet 
modest water efficiency targets. The analysis then gives us information from which to assess whether 
specific targeted investment strategies may be able to reduce risks much further.

the risks from climate change will provide updated evidence about the timing of important risks and 
opportunities and the need for adaptation action. This is captured in the five year cycles of the Climate 
Change Act 2008.

The CCRA used the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) for three time periods – 30-year periods  
centred on the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. These may be interpreted as ‘short-term’, ‘medium-term’ and

sector, the assessment assumed that the Government would only continue to maintain existing flood

The cost effectiveness of different adaptation programmes was not assessed as part of the CCRA but 
the subsequent National Adaptation Programme will assess likely societal changes in order to judge 
where society will adapt autonomously, and where Government can most usefully act. 

The CCRA outputs should be considered as a guide to (a) the possibility of changes in risk over this 
century, (b) the potential direction and magnitude of these changes and (c) whether risks become 
significant in the ‘short-term’ (2020s), ‘medium-term’ (2050s) or ‘long-term’ (2080s). 

2.2. What are the Strengths and Constraints of the Analysis?
The CCRA, for the first time, uses a consistent method to analyse the magnitude and confidence of a 
range of risks and opportunities across disparate sectors. This has never been achieved before for the 
UK. The assessment considered risks across all sectors and involved a high degree of consultation and 
review. Information from a wide range of sources has been used and analysis has been undertaken 
by specialists from leading UK institutions. The assessment can therefore be considered to reflect the 
current state of knowledge on climate risks and opportunities.

The analysis did identify, however, a lack of suitable evidence in many areas. It was not possible to 
quantify many risks and opportunities and in other cases the analysis was incomplete because of a lack 
of suitable information. In addition, it was not possible to assess some of the more complex interactions 
such as the overall risks to ecosystems or to analyse multiplicative effects of several risks occurring 
together; for example successive droughts followed by floods, or multiple infrastructure failures caused 
by severe weather events. 

2.3. How are Risks Categorised?
The CCRA classifies risks and opportunities into three broad impact classes, ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ 
and also identifies those risks that are highly uncertain and difficult to quantify. In addition, projected 
ranges of possible climate outcomes are given across the three emission scenarios for each of the three 
future time periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s). These risks are presented in the “summary plots” and 
“scorecards” provided in the UK CCRA Evidence Report.

2.4. Dealing with Uncertainty – Risk-based Decision Making
The CCRA covers a range of possible future climatic conditions and different rates of population growth. 
It does not provide forecasts of change, predict the exact timing of the emergence of specific risks and 
opportunities, or make assumptions about the likelihood of different climate scenarios. 

The CCRA provides a high level assessment of potential risks at the national scale. It provides a starting 
point for considering climate adaptation but more targeted and local studies will be needed to support 
many adaptation decisions on the ground. Therefore, when using the CCRA, the following approach 
is recommended:

•  Use the CCRA summary plots and scorecards as a guide to the possibility of a risk or opportunity 
occurring (including the order of magnitude, direction of change and potential timing of when high 
magnitude risks might occur).

•  Use the supporting evidence on specific risks to illustrate possible changes in future, based on the 
ranges presented but do not focus on central estimates only or use any of the figures as predictions. 

•  Consider adaptation actions that recognise the high degree of uncertainty and test adaptation 
actions against a wide range of future scenarios, including – for decisions where risk appetite is 
particularly low – scenarios outside of the range presented in the CCRA.

•  For any important investment decisions, complete studies at the appropriate scale (e.g. river

evidence including the establishment of monitoring and further research for both national and local 
level adaptation.

The cost effectiveness of different adaptation programmes was not assessed as part of the CCRA but 
the subsequent National Adaptation Programme will assess likely societal changes in order to judge 
where society will adapt autonomously, and where Government can most usefully act. 

The CCRA outputs should be considered as a guide to (a) the possibility of changes in risk over this 
century, (b) the potential direction and magnitude of these changes and (c) whether risks become 
significant in the ‘short-term’ (2020s), ‘medium-term’ (2050s) or ‘long-term’ (2080s). 

2.2. What are the Strengths and Constraints of the Analysis?
The CCRA, for the first time, uses a consistent method to analyse the magnitude and confidence of a 
range of risks and opportunities across disparate sectors. This has never been achieved before for the 
UK. The assessment considered risks across all sectors and involved a high degree of consultation and 
review. Information from a wide range of sources has been used and analysis has been undertaken 
by specialists from leading UK institutions. The assessment can therefore be considered to reflect the 
current state of knowledge on climate risks and opportunities.

The analysis did identify, however, a lack of suitable evidence in many areas. It was not possible to 
quantify many risks and opportunities and in other cases the analysis was incomplete because of a lack 
of suitable information. In addition, it was not possible to assess some of the more complex interactions 
such as the overall risks to ecosystems or to analyse multiplicative effects of several risks occurring 
together; for example successive droughts followed by floods, or multiple infrastructure failures caused 
by severe weather events. 

2.3. How are Risks Categorised?
The CCRA classifies risks and opportunities into three broad impact classes, ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ 
and also identifies those risks that are highly uncertain and difficult to quantify. In addition, projected 
ranges of possible climate outcomes are given across the three emission scenarios for each of the three 
future time periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s). These risks are presented in the “summary plots” and 
“scorecards” provided in the UK CCRA Evidence Report.

2.4. Dealing with Uncertainty – Risk-based Decision Making
The CCRA covers a range of possible future climatic conditions and different rates of population growth. 
It does not provide forecasts of change, predict the exact timing of the emergence of specific risks and 
opportunities, or make assumptions about the likelihood of different climate scenarios. 

The CCRA provides a high level assessment of potential risks at the national scale. It provides a starting 
point for considering climate adaptation but more targeted and local studies will be needed to support 
many adaptation decisions on the ground. Therefore, when using the CCRA, the following approach 
is recommended:

•  Use the CCRA summary plots and scorecards as a guide to the possibility of a risk or opportunity 
occurring (including the order of magnitude, direction of change and potential timing of when high 
magnitude risks might occur).

•  Use the supporting evidence on specific risks to illustrate possible changes in future, based on the 
ranges presented but do not focus on central estimates only or use any of the figures as predictions. 

•  Consider adaptation actions that recognise the high degree of uncertainty and test adaptation 
actions against a wide range of future scenarios, including – for decisions where risk appetite is 
particularly low – scenarios outside of the range presented in the CCRA.

•  For any important investment decisions, complete studies at the appropriate scale (e.g. river 
catchment), using detailed guidance provided by the relevant organisations, such as Defra for flood 
and coastal erosion management in England and Wales, and Treasury Green Book methods. 

•  For the impacts of greatest concern, and especially where there is low confidence, address gaps in 
evidence including the establishment of monitoring and further research for both national and local 
level adaptation.

3.  What are the main climate risks and 
opportunities in the CCRA?

3.1. Agriculture and Forestry
Overview

The Agriculture and Forestry sectors are sensitive to climatic conditions, so any changes in climate can 
potentially have profound impacts on their productivity and economic viability. 

The CCRA analysis has shown that there are implications for both these sectors from climate change, 
which could impact on the level of productivity and quality of products, and also opportunities, which 
both industries could potentially exploit. 

The Agriculture and Forestry sectors are responsible for managing approximately 90% of UK land; 
they make an important contribution to the UK economy and deliver a wide range of public goods 
and services. It is important that Government works with farmers, foresters, land managers and other 
key organisations to consider the risks highlighted in the CCRA, identify actions to manage risks to the 
industries and consider how opportunities can be best exploited. Due to the length of time trees and 
forests take to reach maturity, decisions in some parts of the forestry sector will have implications up 
to, and beyond, 2050. In agriculture, a shorter crop growth time means that arable farmers and land 
managers can be more responsive and adaptive to climate change. 

In England, Defra leads on agriculture and forestry policies as well as on a range of environmental 
policies, such as water and flooding, that impact on these industries. Most matters relating to 
agriculture and forestry policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of the 
Devolved Governments.

The Agriculture and Forestry theme considers the risks and opportunities to the productivity of these two 
sectors while the Natural Environment theme considers the contribution they make to wider ecosystem 
services (see section 3.5).

Key Findings 

The CCRA identifies that Agriculture and Forestry could be affected by both extreme weather events 
and gradual climate change, particularly beyond 2050. 

The key risks and opportunities identified at UK level are as follows:

Risks Opportunities

Higher summer soil moisture deficits, increasing 
demand for irrigation to maintain crop yields and 
quality.

Increased agricultural yields resulting from 
longer growing seasons and CO2 fertilisation, 
where water or nutrients are not limiting factors.

Increased competition for water resources in the 
summer owing to reduced summer rainfall and 
the need to address unsustainable abstraction.

Opportunities to grow new crops as a result of 
warmer climate and longer growing seasons.

Crop losses and other impacts on high quality 
agricultural land due to flooding and agricultural 
land lost to coastal erosion.

Increased timber yields where water is not 
limiting to tree growth.

Large areas of forests at increased risk from existing 
and new tree diseases and insect pests, resulting 
in reduced timber production, tree mortality and 
declining woodland condition.

Opportunity to plant a range of timber species 
previously not considered suitable for forestry 
in the UK.

Drier conditions and any increase in the frequency 
of drought will reduce agriculture and timber yield 
and affect woodland condition. 

Changes in forest productivity with consequences 
for species selection if timber yields are to be 
maintained. 

More frequent wildfires due to warmer and drier 
conditions.

At a local level, flooding or coastal erosion can be a significant risk to agriculture. In England and Wales, 
currently around 50,000 hectares are at risk of flooding frequently (i.e. at least once every three years) 
and this is projected to increase to around 200,000 ha by the 2080s (or 1% of total agricultural land). 
Agricultural land is also at risk from less frequent flooding (i.e. 1 in 10 year events) and this is projected 
to increase from around 200,000 ha at present to about 400,000 ha by the 2050s and over 500,000 
ha by the 2080s. This is equivalent to about 2% of all agricultural land currently and about 5% by the 
2080s. In the longer term this means the farming sector may need to take a more active role in flood 
risk management or change to more resilient forms of agriculture in high risk areas. 

The projected area of agricultural land at risk of loss from coastal erosion is relatively small, representing 
about 0.06 to 0.09%6 (6,500 to 10,000 ha) of the total area of agricultural land (about 11 million ha) 
in England and Wales in the 2080s. However, as coastal erosion is a natural process, some of this land 
would be lost even without climate change.

In the short term, projected warmer temperatures and CO2 fertilisation may present some opportunities 
to improve forestry and agricultural yields, to increase the geographical range of existing crops/tree 
species and to introduce new crops and tree species, particularly in Southern England. However, these 
opportunities may be limited by projected low water availability in the summer and increased incidence 
of flooding. 

Implications

Domestic agricultural policy is heavily influenced by EU policy. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 
provides support to farmers who follow good agricultural practices, and/or offer non-market benefits 
as well as those prepared to enter into voluntary agri-environment commitments. Regulatory proposals 
published by the European Commission in October 2011 list ‘the sustainable management of natural 
resources, and climate action’ as one of the three objectives for rural development7. Other policies, such 
as the Water Framework Directive8, seek to regulate environmental impact and there are a range of EU 
laws on animal health and welfare and food safety. 

There are a number of measures available under the Rural Development Programme for England9 to 
help farmers adapt to climate change. From 1 January 2012, the new Farming Advice Service offers 
a one-stop-shop to farmers needing advice on a number of subjects, including adaptation to climate 
change, which will help raise farmers’ awareness of the challenges.

Agriculture and Forestry are also influenced by wider policies, for example biomass and biofuels, 
and by international markets. If international demand for UK production were to increase to meet 
a growing demand for these products, this could be a significant opportunity but it may also lead to 
additional pressure on land and water resources in the UK. If international product prices rise, the UK 
may experience greater pressure on resources as the domestic market becomes more favourably priced 
in comparison.

A key driver for the UK Agriculture sector is the need to develop its capacity to produce food sustainably. 
In this context, climate change impacts (e.g. water availability and flooding) are just one of a range 
of pressures on the sector. In England, the Natural Environment White Paper10 commits to carrying 
out a project to look at the challenge of reconciling increased food production whilst enhancing 
the environment. UK Government is working in close partnership with industry, environmental and 
consumer organisations towards publishing project conclusions that will help shape future agriculture 
and food policies. The Business theme (see Section 3.2), highlights the ways in which impacts on the 
food and beverage sub sector may cascade to the Agricultural sector and vice-versa.

The Natural Environment White Paper also sets the context for Forestry policy, and the Independent 
Panel on Forestry will report to Government in 2012 with recommendations on the future direction  
of forestry policy11. Climate change adaptation is one of several key issues the panel are considering. 
The recently revised ‘UK Forestry Standard’12 and its Guidelines on ‘Forests and Climate Change’, give 
a steer on practical measures to consider for adapting forests as a component of sustainable forest  
management. Such adaptation measures, including species diversification, incorporation of climate 
change scenarios in road and drainage system specifications and a move to alternative forest management

systems, are the basis of the Climate Change Action Plan for the 258,000 ha Public Forest Estate in 
England that is now being implemented by the Forestry Commission.

In addition, implementing the commitments outlined in the Water White Paper13, published on the 
8th December 2011, will impact on agriculture and forestry policies and will set the context within which 
each Sector will need to adapt. Of particular importance for agriculture is the reform of abstraction 
licensing which is aimed at providing clearer signals for investment to meet water needs and protect 
water ecosystems.

Through the development of the National Adaptation Programme, we will work with land owners, 
farmers and other key organisations, to identify areas for joint action, and develop policies to support 
sustainable Agriculture and Forestry Sectors.

Devolved Governments

Scotland

As part of Scotland’s Climate Change Adaptation Framework, the Scottish Government has published 
12 ‘Sector Action Plans’ including one for: Agriculture; Forests and Forestry; and Spatial Planning and 
Land Use14. These action plans set out the key climate change issues and challenges for each sector 
and set out work to strengthen resilience to the impacts of climate change, for example through the 
Scotland Rural Development Programme. In March 2011 the Scottish Government published ‘Getting 
the best from our land: a land use strategy for Scotland’15. The Land Use Strategy is a requirement of 
the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 and recognises that land-use decisions should be informed by 
the opportunities and threats from climate change. Implementation of the Strategy will draw on the 
outputs from the UK CCRA. 

Wales

Set within the Rural Development Plan for Wales, 2007-201316, the Glastir agri-environment scheme is 
a five-year, whole farm sustainable land management scheme available to farmers and land managers. 
It is designed to draw together the Welsh Government’s commitment to sustainable agricultural 
development in the context of climate change and is part-funded by the EU. Expected outcomes include 
better water management, reduced flood risk, and conserved and enhanced biodiversity.

Land managers are expected to be better informed and trained on climate change impacts and 
possibilities for adaptation thanks to knowledge transfer, advice and skills development through the 
Farming Connect programme17.

‘Responding to climate change’ is one of the four strategic themes in Wales’ forestry strategy, Woodlands 
for Wales18. This moves Wales towards more mixed and native woodland, and reduces reliance on 
clear felling regimes. Forestry Commission Wales will develop the Glastir woodland management grant 
scheme, develop guidance on woodland management and agricultural systems and investigate the 
benefits of urban tree planting for shade and drainage.

Northern Ireland

The Northern Ireland Rural Development Plan, 2007-201319, includes delivery of Agri-environment 
Schemes designed to maintain a high proportion of agriculture land under environmental enhancement 
agreements. Biodiversity, water quality and climate change objectives are integral to these schemes and 
are an important contribution to achieve sustainable land management. The NI Sustainable Development 
Implementation Plan – ‘Focus on the Future’20, also includes agriculture related economic and social 
actions/deliverables in addition to environmental actions/deliverables. The Rural Development Plan also 
supports woodland creation and the sustainable management of existing forests. Forest Service will 
promote the recently revised ‘Forestry Standard’ and its Guidelines on ‘Forests and Climate Change’, 
which provide forest managers and owners with a range of practical measures to consider when creating 
new forests and managing existing forests in the context of climate change.

3.2. Business
Overview

The CCRA identifies the main climate challenges to businesses, which include: flooding and coastal 
erosion; increased competition for water, energy and materials; and the disruption of transport networks 
and communication links. These risks particularly affect activities which:

• rely on large fixed assets (especially near main rivers or the coast)

• have complex supply chains

• rely substantially on natural assets.

The CCRA Business Sector Report looks in detail at the risks and opportunities facing five sub-sectors 
which meet these criteria, namely: financial services, tourism, food and beverage manufacturing, primary 
extractives (oil, gas and mining), and chemical manufacturing. Fisheries productivity is considered in the 
CCRA Marine Sector Report. 

Responsibility for adaptation in the Business sector is shared across a number of Government Departments 
and other bodies, including Defra (flood and coastal erosion, water resources management, biodiversity), 
Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS, supporting business in mainstreaming adaptation, 
enabling industries to respond to the future needs and opportunities presented), Department of Energy 
and Climate Change (DECC, energy infrastructure and energy efficiency – including demand for 
cooling); Communities and Local Government (CLG, planning, housing, urban regeneration, building 
regulations) and Department of Health (DH, effects of heatwaves on human health). Many policy 
areas are devolved and are the responsibility of the Devolved Governments in Wales, Scotland and 
Northern Ireland. HM Treasury leads on financial regulation and on the impacts of climate change for 
the mortgage and insurance industries. 

The Environment Agency (EA) is responsible for implementing flood risk management policy and 
enforcing other policies in England and Wales; similar responsibilities fall to the Scottish Environment 
Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland and Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Rivers 
Agency in Northern Ireland.

Heritage bodies (Natural England and English Heritage, the Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish 
Natural Heritage and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency) have a wide range of responsibilities in 
relation to environmental protection and play a role in supporting the tourism industry.

‘Responding to climate change’ is one of the four strategic themes in Wales’ forestry strategy, Woodlands 
for Wales18. This moves Wales towards more mixed and native woodland, and reduces reliance on 
clear felling regimes. Forestry Commission Wales will develop the Glastir woodland management grant 
scheme, develop guidance on woodland management and agricultural systems and investigate the 
benefits of urban tree planting for shade and drainage.

Northern Ireland

The Northern Ireland Rural Development Plan, 2007-201319, includes delivery of Agri-environment 
Schemes designed to maintain a high proportion of agriculture land under environmental enhancement 
agreements. Biodiversity, water quality and climate change objectives are integral to these schemes and 
are an important contribution to achieve sustainable land management. The NI Sustainable Development 
Implementation Plan – ‘Focus on the Future’20, also includes agriculture related economic and social 
actions/deliverables in addition to environmental actions/deliverables. The Rural Development Plan also 
supports woodland creation and the sustainable management of existing forests. Forest Service will 
promote the recently revised ‘Forestry Standard’ and its Guidelines on ‘Forests and Climate Change’, 
which provide forest managers and owners with a range of practical measures to consider when creating 
new forests and managing existing forests in the context of climate change.

3.2. Business
Overview

The CCRA identifies the main climate challenges to businesses, which include: flooding and coastal 
erosion; increased competition for water, energy and materials; and the disruption of transport networks 
and communication links. These risks particularly affect activities which:

• rely on large fixed assets (especially near main rivers or the coast)

• have complex supply chains

• rely substantially on natural assets.

The CCRA Business Sector Report looks in detail at the risks and opportunities facing five sub-sectors 
which meet these criteria, namely: financial services, tourism, food and beverage manufacturing, primary 
extractives (oil, gas and mining), and chemical manufacturing. Fisheries productivity is considered in the 
CCRA Marine Sector Report. 

Responsibility for adaptation in the Business sector is shared across a number of Government Departments 
and other bodies, including Defra (flood and coastal erosion, water resources management, biodiversity), 
Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS, supporting business in mainstreaming adaptation, 
enabling industries to respond to the future needs and opportunities presented), Department of Energy 
and Climate Change (DECC, energy infrastructure and energy efficiency – including demand for 
cooling); Communities and Local Government (CLG, planning, housing, urban regeneration, building 
regulations) and Department of Health (DH, effects of heatwaves on human health). Many policy 
areas are devolved and are the responsibility of the Devolved Governments in Wales, Scotland and 
Northern Ireland. HM Treasury leads on financial regulation and on the impacts of climate change for 
the mortgage and insurance industries. 

The Environment Agency (EA) is responsible for implementing flood risk management policy and 
enforcing other policies in England and Wales; similar responsibilities fall to the Scottish Environment 
Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland and Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Rivers 
Agency in Northern Ireland.

Heritage bodies (Natural England and English Heritage, the Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish 
Natural Heritage and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency) have a wide range of responsibilities in 
relation to environmental protection and play a role in supporting the tourism industry.

Key Findings

The CCRA identifies the main risks and opportunities to the Business sector as being related to flooding, 
heating and water resources.

The key risks and opportunities identified at UK level were:

Risks Opportunities

Possible decrease in output for UK businesses due 
to an increase in supply chain disruption as a result 
of extreme events.

Possible increase in market opportunities such 
as tourism and leisure industry.

Risk of increase in monetary losses as a result of 
interruption to business from flooding.

Delivery of adaptive measures (products and 
services) as part of the move to a low carbon 
economy.

Greater variability in the availability of water.

Potential loss of staff hours due to high internal 
building temperatures (assessed as being of 
particular relevance to the health, education and 
retail sectors, which have large workforces).

The analysis carried out highlights how inter-connected the Business sector is with other sectors in the 
CCRA. In particular:

• A significant number of the top risks for business relate to the impacts of flooding.

•  The availability of water for industrial and other business use is related to impacts upon, and action 
taken by, the water supply sector.

•  Disruption to transport and energy supplies, and heat-related impacts (on productivity, products and 
machinery) will all affect the business sector.

•  Risks to ecosystem resources and services from the natural environment, such as food, timber, water 
quality and waste breakdown, will impact on, and be affected by, businesses.

• Impacts on the food and beverage sub-sector will cascade to the agriculture sector and vice versa

Businesses, therefore, need to be aware of these inter-connections and understand how sectoral 
responses to climate change may lead to changes in the risks that they have to manage. 

Implications

Climate change does not necessarily create ‘new’ risks for the Business sector; rather it represents 
a change to existing risks, and in some cases opportunities. For example, businesses have already 
experienced the impacts of severe weather events on the transport infrastructure upon which they 
heavily rely. With climate change, such events may last longer or become more frequent. Failure 
to consider climate risk and adaptation in decision-making processes could, therefore, have severe 
consequences for the UK economy with further impacts felt across all other sectors.

The policy framework for managing the potential future risks of climate change is extremely diverse, 
reflecting the broad range of risks that the Business sector may face. For example, policy protecting 
assets from flood risk and coastal erosion, building regulations and planning policy will play a vital role 
in protecting UK businesses and their supply chains from the negative impacts of climate change. There 
are a number of pieces of legislation that aim to manage these risks.

As part of the development of the NAP, the UK Government will work with business organisations 
to identify areas for joint action. Our aim will be to improve awareness and understanding of climate 
change impacts, so that business can plan and make decisions that build in the management of climate-
related risks.

The UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) have developed a number of tools that help business. 
UKCIP’s Speed Business Areas Climate Assessment Tool (Speed BACLIAT), for example, is a simple 
checklist that can be used to assess the potential impacts of climate change at an organisational level. In 
future, the Environment Agency will carry out this advisory role for business and a wide range of other 
sectors in England and for non-devolved matters.

Given the clear links many UK businesses have to international supply chains, customers etc, the risks and 
opportunities identified in the CCRA are of course not the only ones that need consideration (for example 
see Foresight IDCC Report). These wider issues will also be considered in the development of the NAP. 

Devolved Governments

Scotland

The Scottish Government has published an adaptation ‘Sector Action Plan’ for business and industry21 
which sets out the key climate change issues and challenges and planned work to strengthen resilience 
of businesses to the impacts of climate change. 

Adaptation Scotland provides free advice and support to help business adapt to climate change. 
Examples of guidance provided by Adaptation Scotland include ‘Adapting to Climate Change: A Guide 
for Businesses in Scotland’22 and a series of information notes to help small businesses23. 

Wales

The Welsh Government business support service can provide advice and support regarding climate 
change impacts, including via the Business Wales website.24

Tourism is a prominent business sector in Wales, and one that relies heavily on the condition of the 
environment. A recent study exploring the impacts of climate change on the Welsh visitor economy sets 
out recommendations to help the tourist industry to adapt to climate change.

Consistent with its central organising principle of sustainable development, the Welsh Government’s 
Sustainable Tourism Framework25 highlights adapting to climate change as being of critical importance 
to the future of sustainable tourism in Wales.

3.3. Health and Wellbeing (including local resilience and social vulnerability26)
Overview

The CCRA indicates that climate change could have significant implications for the health and wellbeing 
of the UK population. There are implications for public health, the continuity of health and social care 
services both within the NHS and beyond, the resilience of local emergency services and the impact on 
the most socially vulnerable. There are also some potential benefits, for example, a projected reduction 
in winter mortality and morbidity. 

Health and social care are devolved. In England, the DH leads the health and social care sector, which 
includes the National Health Service (NHS), and associated Arm’s Length Bodies (ALBs). In Scotland, the 
Scottish Government Health Directorate provides the central management of the NHS and oversees 
the work of 14 NHS boards that plan and deliver health services in their area. The Welsh Government 
is responsible for the NHS in Wales which delivers services through seven Health Boards and three NHS 
Trusts. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety leads the health 
and social care sector, with the delivery of an integrated system through four regional health and social 
care organisations and 13 other associated ALBs.

Policy governing the role of the emergency services and resilience to the impacts of climate change at 
the local level is also devolved, although this is not the case for policing in Wales. At the UK level several 
Government Departments have responsibilities including Cabinet Office, Home Office, DCLG and DH.

Policy and regulation of food safety and food hygiene is devolved across the UK, but with a single body 
– the Food Standards Agency – acting as the lead department across the UK. FSA is also responsible for 
food labelling policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (with Defra leading in England) and for 
nutrition policy in Scotland and Northern Ireland (the Department for Health lead for nutrition policy in 
England, and Welsh Government in Wales).

26  Social Vulnerability is an assessment of the demographic and socioeconomic factors which increase or attenuate the impacts of hazard events on local 
populations (Tierney et al. 2001, Heinz Centre 2002)

Northern Ireland

When progressing the Northern Ireland Adaptation Programme, Northern Ireland Government 
Departments, through the Cross Departmental Working Group on Climate Change, will consider 
appropriate actions to address climate change risks and opportunities for businesses.

Climate Northern Ireland provides advice and support on the impacts of climate change within Northern 
Ireland and the adaptation actions necessary to deal with it. Climate Northern Ireland will be publishing 
guidance in February 2012 on how the business sector can prepare for climate change and this will 
include information sheets particularly tailored for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Key Findings

The CCRA indicates that health and wellbeing will be affected by both extreme weather events and 
long-term gradual change. The main challenges arise from higher temperatures (on land and sea), 
changing rainfall patterns and rising sea levels.

The CCRA identifies the following key risks and opportunities at the UK level:

Risks Opportunities

Increased summer temperatures may lead to 
increased risk of mortality and morbidity due 
to heat.

Increased winter temperatures may lead to 
decreased levels of mortality and morbidity due 
to cold.

Increased flooding would increase the risk of 
deaths, injuries and people suffering from mental 
health effects as a result of the impacts of flooding.

Increased summer temperatures combined with 
increased periods of time spent outdoors could 
increase vitamin D levels and help to improve 
physical and mental health of people.

Increased ozone levels by the end of the century 
could lead to an increased risk of mortality and 
respiratory hospital admissions

Increased summer temperatures combined with 
increased periods of time spent outdoors may lead 
to an increased risk in the number of skin cancer 
cases and deaths.

Increased temperatures and changed rainfall 
patterns may lead to an increased health risk from 
water, vector and food borne diseases.

Increased sea temperatures may lead to increased 
marine pathogens and harmful algae blooms with 
a consequent negative effect on human health.

Risks of summer mortality and morbidity, overheating in hospitals and other buildings, summer air 
pollution (ozone), and the incidence of some marine and freshwater pathogens are projected to 
become of increasing significance by the middle of the century. Flooding (both direct impacts and 
indirect impacts, such as on mental health) is also a risk identified in the CCRA for the Health Sector. 
An increase in skin cancer cases due to greater sun exposure may occur by the 2080s, particularly in 
Southern England.

Implications

The risks identified through the CCRA reinforce the importance of a climate resilient health and social 
care system to minimise the risks of service failure with knock-on impacts for patients, workforce, 
the wellbeing of the UK population and the wider economy (through the cost of service provision, 
impact on social cohesion and decline in workforce productivity and wellbeing). There would be added 
burdens on our emergency services in responding to more frequent flooding, heatwaves and wildfires.

UK Government is working with local communities to build resilience and better prepare for such 
events, to ensure continuity of high quality health and social care provision, which in turn should reduce 
the overall costs in the short and long term (financial, social, health, environmental) of the potential 
risks posed by current and future climate impacts.

Climate resilience is increasingly taken into account in the way that health and social care infrastructure, 
buildings, facilities and estates are planned, commissioned and maintained. In England, the DH has 
already considered many of the risks identified in the CCRA through its Climate Change Plan27. The 
Department together with the Health Protection Agency will shortly update their 2008 report on 
the Health Effects of Climate Change. England has a Heatwave Plan to manage the impacts of high 
temperatures on human health.

Within the NHS in England, the Sustainable Development Unit promotes adaptation action across 
the NHS and is supporting various projects that seek to build adaptive capacity and identify robust 
adaptive responses28 such as reducing the risk of summer overheating in hospitals. The NHS Carbon 
Reduction Strategy (2009)29 suggests that NHS organisations establish a Board-approved Sustainable 
Development Management Plan which includes several adaptation measures such as the promotion of 
water efficiency.

Most policies relating to air quality (control of ground level ozone) and marine and freshwater quality 
are addressed at EU level with their implementation devolved across the UK. 

Significant improvements have been made in recent years in an effort to reduce risks to human 
health from consuming contaminated shellfish and from swimming in contaminated bathing waters. 
Investment in excess of £75 million has been made by Water Utilities in the UK since 2000 on waste 
water-treatment and infrastructure to improve shellfish water quality. Furthermore, epidemiological 
surveillance systems are put in place across EU Member States once a pathogen has been included in 
the European Network for Epidemiologic Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (2119/98/
EC and amendments thereafter). There is currently no statutory requirement to monitor incidence and 
prevalence of non-cholera Vibrios and some vector-borne diseases pathogens which are sensitive to 
environmental temperatures. 

Defra will seek to influence evolving EU and international policies to take sufficient account of climate 
change and relevant risks identified in the CCRA. 

Government will look to build the evidence base as to the part climate change might play in increasing 
the risk of UV exposure and, therefore, the incidence of skin cancer towards the 2080s. Several 
interacting factors are at play that determine this risk, including the level of projected cloud cover 
and how people might behave in a warmer, sunnier climate, for example, by taking the necessary 
protections to minimise exposure to the sun by seeking shade or by applying sunscreen.

In England, the new partnership approach to funding flood and coastal resilience could potentially make 
Government funding available to pay for a share of any worthwhile scheme over time. Cost savings 
and local contributions will mean more communities can benefit from flood and coastal defences; thus 
reducing the risk of flooding and consequential impacts on public health and the continuity of health 
and social care services.

Local networks of health and adaptation expertise have been established in several parts of the UK, 
each driving initiatives that seek to address local climate-related health risks. Ongoing health reforms 
(for example the role proposed in England for local authority health and wellbeing Boards and Directors 
of Public Health) will present important opportunities for locally determined action informed by the 
local assessment of climate risk, reflecting the needs of the local community and delivering solutions 
which can deliver the greatest co-benefits. 

This in turn builds on and links with the close working that already exists at the local level between the 
health, social care and local emergency planning/resilience networks across the UK established under 
the Civil Contingencies Act 200430 (for example local resilience forums in England and Wales and 
Strategic Co-ordination Groups in Scotland)31.

Currently the UK Government has a wide range of policies in place across this sector, some going 
through some significant reform. As part of the development of the NAP, we will use the outputs from 
the CCRA to support any further action needed to adapt to risks from a changing climate, promote 
wider co-benefits linked to adaptation measures and contribute to the wider wellbeing of individuals 
and communities.

Scotland

As part of Scotland’s Climate Change Adaptation Framework, the Scottish Government has published 12 
‘Sector Action Plans’, including one on Health and Wellbeing32. This provides an overview of key issues 
in adapting to the consequences of climate change for the health and wellbeing sector in Scotland. The 
actions outlined provide an indication of the broad range of work planned over the coming years to 
strengthen resilience of this sector to the impacts of climate change. 

Wales

The Climate Change and Health Working Group has already considered many of the risks identified 
in the CCRA in its publication, Tackling the health effects of climate change (2009)33. The document 
recognises that climate change is a significant and emerging threat to public health and wellbeing, and 
identifies two ways in which climate change will have an impact on the Health Sector:

• directly, as a result of, for example, rising mean temperatures, and flooding

• indirectly, as a result of vector, water and food-borne diseases and air pollution.

3.4. Buildings and Infrastructure
Overview

Climate change may have significant implications for the built environment, including buildings and 
energy, transport, water and ICT infrastructure. Infrastructure assets and buildings are in operation or 
use for many years, which means that decisions made now about their design and construction will 
have long-term consequences. 

The UK Government and the Devolved Governments have a range of responsibilities for the built 
environment, including policy for the planning system, building regulations and building control, water 
and transport infrastructure and flood and coastal erosion risk management. Furthermore, new low 
carbon infrastructure and the ‘Green Deal’ for homes and businesses will have a crucial role in aiding 
the transition to a low carbon economy. It will be important to consider climate resilience as part of 
this process.

Infrastructure UK36 produces the UK Government’s Infrastructure Plan, providing a strong focus on the 
UK’s long term infrastructure priorities. Responsibility for the three key infrastructure sectors in England 
– energy, transport and water – rests with DECC, DfT and Defra respectively, although the sectors 
range from being Government-led (e.g. Highways Agency), private (e.g. ports), to regulated (e.g. water 
companies) and unregulated (e.g. airports).

Key Findings

The CCRA analysis indicates that buildings and infrastructure will be affected by both extreme weather 
events and long-term gradual change in the climate. The challenges arise from higher temperatures 
and changing rainfall patterns. 

The CCRA sets out the following key risks and opportunities for Buildings and Infrastructure at the 
UK level:

Risks Opportunities

Energy

Energy Infrastructure at significant risk 
of flooding.

Reduced energy demand for heating.

Higher energy demand for cooling.

Heat damage/disruption to energy infrastructure.

Increased water demand for energy generation.

Transport

Road and railways at significant risk of flooding. Shorter shipping routes and reduced 
transportation costs due to less arctic ice.

Scouring of road and rail bridges.

36 See http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/ppp_infrastructureuk.htm for more information.

Water

Supply-demand deficits.

Buildings

Damage to property due to flooding and coastal 
erosion.

Overheating in buildings including homes, schools 
and hospitals.

Increasing impact from the Urban Heat Island effect.

Buildings affected by subsidence.

Flooding is identified as the most significant risk, currently and in the short term, across the UK. Water 
availability and overheating of buildings are assessed to be increasingly significant by the middle of the 
century, particularly in England. 

Implications

The CCRA reinforces the importance of increasing the climate resilience of our buildings and 
infrastructure. This has a range of implications for the way that buildings and infrastructure are planned 
and commissioned, designed, built and maintained, including housing, offices, schools, hospitals and 
other public buildings, roads, railways and power stations and the part played by water infrastructure 
in managing the supply/demand balance. Green infrastructure – the living network of green spaces, 
water and other environmental features in both urban and rural areas – can help to reduce extremes of 
temperature and manage water flows that affect buildings. In October 2011, the Green Infrastructure 
Partnership37 was launched, which will provide the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits that well 
designed high quality green infrastructure can provide.

The UK Government recognises that adapting infrastructure is a priority and in May 2011 Climate 
Resilient Infrastructure38 recommended action to achieve an infrastructure network that is resilient to 
today’s natural hazards and prepared for the future changing climate. The Cabinet Office has published 
guidance on building infrastructure resilience to address the immediate risks39.

The results of the CCRA reinforce the need for Government, businesses, communities and the 
infrastructure industry to continue to manage the risk of flooding and coastal erosion. 

In England the Government expects to invest at least £2.1 billion on flooding and coastal erosion over 
the next four years. The Environment Agency and the other risk management authorities expect to 
provide improved protection to at least 145,000 households over this period. The Government also 
helps infrastructure operators manage their flood risk – for example, through the new Flood Warnings 
for Infrastructure service provided by the Environment Agency; and collaborative work with critical 
infrastructure operators on the resilience of critical infrastructure to natural hazards led by the Cabinet 
Office across the UK.

The Energy National Policy Statements40 ensure decisions on development consents for major energy 
infrastructure are informed by consideration of the impacts of flood risk. They require both assessments 
of flood risk and proposed mitigation measures to set out how the proposal will take account of the 
impacts of climate change, using the most recently available UK Climate Projections. As a minimum, 
this involves using projections based on the emissions scenario that the Independent Committee on 
Climate Change suggests the world is currently most closely following, but the high emissions scenario 
(high impact, low likelihood) is used for any safety-critical aspects of the infrastructure.

The draft National Planning Policy Framework41, which DCLG consulted on from July to October 2011, 
stated that the Government’s objective is that planning should fully support the transition to a low 
carbon economy in a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk and coastal change. To achieve 
this objective, the consultation draft said the planning system should aim to:

• Minimise vulnerability and provide resilience to impacts arising from climate change;

•  Avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding by directing development away from 
areas at highest risk or where development is necessary, making it safe without increasing flood risk 
elsewhere; and

•  Reduce risk from coastal change by avoiding inappropriate development in vulnerable areas or 
adding to the impacts of physical changes to the coast.

Under the Localism Act 2011, planning authorities and other public bodies in England have a duty to 
co-operate with each other in relation to planning of strategic cross boundary matters when they are 
preparing local and marine plans. 

To this end, local planning authorities should adopt proactive strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change.

The Water White Paper13 includes a focus on increasing the resilience of our water supplies to future 
pressures such as climate change. Among the reforms set out were: 

•  Over the long-term, to introduce a reformed water abstraction regime, as signaled in the Natural 
Environment White Paper; 

•  With regulators, to provide clearer guidance to water companies on planning for the long-term, and 
keeping demand down;

•  To consult on the introduction of national standards and a new planning approval system for 
sustainable drainage.

New systems of marine planning are also currently being introduced across the UK. The Marine Policy 
Statement (MPS)42 was adopted jointly by the Secretary of State, Scottish Ministers, Welsh Ministers and 
the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland in March 2011. The MPS provides a framework 
for marine planning across all UK waters and ensures the sustainable use of marine resources and 
strategic management of marine activities from renewable energy to nature conservation, fishing, 
recreation and tourism.

Building regulations set minimum water efficiency standards for new housing, ensure structural stability 
and limit heat gain. The recent Housing Strategy (for England)43 emphasises the importance of ensuring 
that both existing and new homes are sustainable now and in the future, to deliver resilient, adaptable 
built environments, enhancing the natural environment and people’s quality of life. 

With increasing temperatures and a higher incidence of summer heatwaves, the risks of overheating 
are projected to increase for all buildings, and there is evidence that some types of buildings are already 
vulnerable to summer overheating. CLG is reviewing the evidence in this area and the case for action.

The UK Government has established the Green Construction Board to help ensure that the pursuit of 
greener construction promotes economic growth. The Board has senior level representation from the 
construction, property and infrastructure sectors and from Government. This builds on the work of the 
Low Carbon Construction Innovation and Growth Team in BIS.

In 2008 the Highways Agency published their Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Framework44 in 
which a climate change risk assessment methodology has been developed. This ensures consideration 
of climate change in design standards and specifications, routine maintenance, operating procedures 
and contingency planning. Through this process, increases in precipitation and temperature have been 
highlighted as having the potential to threaten the operation of the network. As a result road surface 
specifications have been amended to withstand higher temperatures which follow previous alterations 
to the standards for increased drainage capacity. As these design changes are being made now, the 
costs will become embedded, so the expectation is that there won’t be a sudden requirement for large 
investment in adaptation measures in the future.

Network Rail has previously carried out climate change risk assessments and research and has weather 
standards and risk management policies in place. A major research project (Tomorrow’s Railway and 
Climate Change Adaptation, TRaCCA) is assessing the risks of temperature (leading to track buckling, 
staff exposure to heat stress, overhead line sag and overheating of line-side equipment), precipitation 
(leading to flooding, scour and landslip), wind (leading to trees obstructing railway lines) and sea level 
rise (leading to overtopping/damage of sea defences at coastal railways). The monitoring of rail buckling 
is a high priority, as well as flooding and sea level rise. Through established negotiations Network Rail, 
the Regulator (Office of Rail Regulator (ORR)) and DfT are working to agree adaptation measures which 
will be implemented during Control Period 5 (2013/14 to 2018/19) and monitored at the highest level. 
The Initial Industry Plan for this period has concluded that no major additional funding is required 
during this period as the majority of assets have a relatively short life (in climate change terms), however 
for some of the assets (in particular bridges) Network Rail has identified that £70 million of additional 
expenditure is required during Control Period 5 to accommodate climate change.

As part of the development of the National Adaptation Programme, we will work together with key 
organisations to consider how best to respond to any risks identified in the CCRA where further action 
is required.

will be implemented during Control Period 5 (2013/14 to 2018/19) and monitored at the highest level. 
The Initial Industry Plan for this period has concluded that no major additional funding is required 
during this period as the majority of assets have a relatively short life (in climate change terms), however 
for some of the assets (in particular bridges) Network Rail has identified that £70 million of additional 
expenditure is required during Control Period 5 to accommodate climate change.

As part of the development of the National Adaptation Programme, we will work together with key 
organisations to consider how best to respond to any risks identified in the CCRA where further action 
is required.

Devolved Governments

Scotland

In Scotland, national planning policies are set out in the National Planning Framework and Scottish 
Planning Policy (SPP)45. Both state that climate change adaptation measures need to be considered in 
development planning.

The Scottish Government has published adaptation ‘Sector Action Plans’ for the Built Environment, 
Energy, Transport and Water Environment and Resource46. These Actions Plans set out the key climate 
change issues and challenges and planned work to strengthen resilience. 

A National Flood Risk Assessment has been undertaken by the Scottish Environment Protection 
Agency (SEPA) which provides a detailed picture of flooding impacts across Scotland. The new national 
assessment has considered main sources of flooding to identify the areas which at present are at the 
greatest risk of flooding. The National Flood Risk Assessment has identified that in Scotland one in 20 
homes and one in 14 businesses are at risk of flooding.

SEPA has undertaken a further assessment of where the impacts of floods are likely to be greatest in 
future. This allows responsible public bodies to target efforts in a way which will benefit communities, 
the economy and the environment. These areas are called Potentially Vulnerable Areas. The identification 
of a Potentially Vulnerable Area has important implications for subsequent efforts to understand and 
address flood risk. The assessment will also enable national and local government and other organisations 
with a responsibility for flood risk management, to develop a co-ordinated approach to tackle flooding 
more effectively.

Wales

The National Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management was published in November 
201147, and the Environment Agency will report on progress annually. 

Various Technical Advice Notes (TANs) aid in embedding adaptation into the built environment, 
and provide supplementary guidance to Planning Policy Wales. With the full devolution of Building 
Regulations from January 2012, the Welsh Government will be able to set improved standards for all 
new buildings, for example in ventilation and water efficiency.

The objectives of the Wales Transport Strategy (WTS) (2008) are delivered at a national level through 
the National Transport Plan (NTP) (2010)48, and at a regional level through the Regional Transport Plans 
prepared by the Regional Transport Consortia. A transport system that is adapting to the impacts of 
climate change is a key long-term outcome of the WTS.

The Strategic Policy Position Statement on Water (2011)49 sets out the Welsh Government’s position on 
aspects of water policy in response to future pressures and challenges, including a range of measures 
which will help address the impacts of climate change on the availability of water.

Northern Ireland

Completion of Northern Ireland’s preliminary flood risk assessments, water demand profiling, 
environmental monitoring together with energy supply, consumption/performance studies have helped 
to identify, evaluate and plan for flooding, drought, water quality and overheating. 

Northern Ireland’s overarching Sustainable Development Strategy provides a robust framework for the 
achievement of sustainable development in Northern Ireland, including the delivery of effective/resilient 
climate change mitigation and adaption delivery mechanisms. Current planning policy minimises flood 
risk to property by restricting development in flood plains and in areas of flood.

Northern Ireland’s roads authority, Roads Service, has identified “Landslides and Subsidence” as one of 
the more prevalent risks associated with climate change. Roads Service is actively undertaking extensive 
research on this topic in an attempt to fully understand the failure mechanisms, mitigate the realisation 
of failure events and compose an adequate and effective adaption programme.

3.5. Natural Environment
Overview

The Natural Environment theme covers a range of elements across both the physical and biological 
world: wildlife, rivers and streams, lakes and seas, urban green space and open countryside, forests, 
fisheries and farmland. It underpins all aspects of our lives. The ecosystem services provided by the 
natural environment are the foundation of sustained economic growth and personal wellbeing. The 
recent UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA)50 provides us with a comprehensive overview of the 
state of the natural environment in the UK and a new way of estimating our national ecological wealth.

Natural environment and biodiversity policies are devolved. In England, Defra leads overarching policy, 
with CLG leading on planning policy, DECC on energy policy and DfT on transport policy. All these 
policy areas impact on the Natural Environment. The Scottish Government, Welsh Government and 
Northern Ireland Executive are responsible for natural environment and biodiversity policy in Scotland, 
Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively.

Responsibility for domestic marine and fisheries policy is devolved to the appropriate Government 
Departments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England, and for negotiations on EU and 
international policies, Defra has lead responsibility. 

UK Government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive have a 
shared vision for clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas.

The natural environment is vulnerable to both extreme weather events and incremental climate change. 
It is also an important asset to help society mitigate impacts and to adapt to climate change: managing 
floods, cooling urban areas and capturing and storing drinking water. CCRA analysis has considered 
the direct and indirect impacts climate change may have on biodiversity and the consequences to 
ecosystem services. 

The natural environment is already under considerable pressure, as highlighted by the NEA. The 
CCRA analysis indicates that a changing climate presents both risks and opportunities for the natural 
environment.

50 http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/

Key Findings 

The CCRA suggests that, taken collectively, the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on 
the natural environment could be significant by the 2050s, potentially further exacerbating existing 
pressures on ecosystems and contributing to the further decline of some species.

The key risks and opportunities identified at the UK level are:

Risks Opportunities

Low water levels and reduced river flows leading 
to increased concentration of pollutants from 
agriculture, sewage and air pollution damaging 
freshwater habitats and other ecosystem services.

Higher temperatures leading to increase 
in some provisioning services for example, 
agriculture and forestry (assuming that water 
availability is not a constraint).

Soil moisture deficits and erosion impacting 
biodiversity and soil carbon and increasing risk of 
wildfires.

Increased habitat range for some generalist 
species e.g. warm water fish or southerly 
insects and plants.

Increased prevalence of invasive non-native species, 
pests and pathogens impacting on animal, plant 
and human health provisioning services (such as 
fisheries) and biodiversity.

Warmer rivers, lakes and seas impacting on 
biodiversity and the productivity and functioning 
of aquatic and marine ecosystems.

Flooding and coastal erosion impacting on key 
coastal habitats and other ecosystem services 
(including the extent of beaches and nature sites 
for tourism).

Loss of climate space, with species unable to track 
climate change especially resulting from habitat 
fragmentation (due to cumulative impact of risks 
and policy decisions taken in other sectors).

Possibility of algal blooms, ocean acidification and 
species range shifts impacting on marine habitats, 
species and ecosystem services.

Changes in timing of seasonal events and migration 
patterns can result in mismatches between species 
such as predator-prey/host relationships.

A number of risks and opportunities (such as increased yields, flood risk and plant disease) relate to 
commercial farming and forestry and are discussed in the Agriculture and Forestry Section (3.1.).

Implications

The importance of ecosystem services and biodiversity is recognised internationally. There are a number 
of EU Directives that seek to protect and enhance our natural resources, now and in the future, including: 
the Water Framework Directive, the Floods Directive, the Urban Waste Water and Treatment Directive, 
the Habitats Directive (currently being reviewed by Defra), the Birds Directive, and the Marine Strategy 
Framework Directive. Internationally, the UK played a key role in securing the historic global agreement 
in Nagoya in 2010 to take urgent action to halt the loss of biodiversity51.

In addition, a wide range of EU programmes, including the Common Agricultural Policy, Cohesion Policy 
and Common Fisheries Policy support farmers, land managers and fishers to adopt more sustainable 
approaches and so contribute to the ecosystem services the natural environment provides. 

In June 2011 the UK Government published ‘The Natural Choice: securing the value of nature’52, the 
first natural environment White Paper in 20 years, to meet its EU and international commitments and 
to protect the crucial role ecosystems and biodiversity play in our wellbeing and economic prosperity. 
The White Paper commits to reversing the historic decline of the natural environment – moving from 
net biodiversity loss to net gain. Adaptation is a theme that runs throughout the White Paper.

The White Paper also highlights the challenges of protecting and enhancing nature whilst at the same 
time tackling pressures brought about by climate change on other resources such as water, food 
production and land and soil erosion. Tough choices may need to be made which the outputs of the 
CCRA will help inform.

In August 2011, the UK Government published its ambitious new biodiversity strategy ‘Biodiversity 
2020: A strategy for England’s wildlife and ecosystem services’53, setting out the strategic direction for 
biodiversity policy for the next decade on land (including rivers and lakes) and at sea. This responds to 
the challenges laid in the earlier report by Professor Sir John Lawton54 which concluded that England’s 
collection of wild areas did not represent a coherent and resilient ecological network capable of 
responding to climate change and other pressures. Delivery of the Natural Environment White Paper’s 
vision requires action now to support integrated landscape scale approaches and as such will contribute 
to increased resilience of the natural environment to climate change.

Maritime legislation in general is also strengthening, as evidenced by the UK Marine and Coastal  
Access Act 200955, the Marine (Scotland) Act 201056, the Northern Ireland Marine Bill57 and the 
EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive58. Some unique challenges in the marine environment 
include ocean acidification and low oxygen zones. The long-term implications of these changes are  
poorly understood.

In addition, in 2002, the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations set out a vision of clean, 
healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas. Since then, the state of our seas has 
been monitored and assessed (see Charting Progress 1 and 2 Reports)59.

To specifically address climate change implications for our marine environment, the UK Marine Climate 
Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP), a partnership between marine scientists and sponsors from 
the UK and Devolved Governments, their agencies and industry, aims to develop a long-term multi-
disciplinary approach to understanding the implications of climate change in our seas. It plays a key role 
in providing marine climate change expertise for national and international high-level reporting such as 
Charting Progress 2 and OSPAR’s Quality Status Report. MCCIP also provides technical support to help 
the marine industry to develop their adaptive capabilities to climate change.

More recently, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (Cefas), through funding 
from UK Government, has also established a new “Marine Climate Change Centre” to provide a 
“one-stop-shop” for detailed expert advice on impacts of climate change on the marine environment.

As part of the development of the NAP (2013), we will use the outputs from the CCRA to inform 
decisions on action needed to improve the resilience of the natural environment.

Devolved Governments

Scotland

Increasing the resilience of the natural systems on which communities depend to the impacts of climate 
change is part of the aim of Scotland’s Climate Change Adaptation Framework60. The Framework’s 
principles promote an ecosystem approach which recognises the interdependence between sectors 
and a healthy environment. Amongst the 12 ‘Sector Action Plans’, those on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Resilience, Water Environment and Resource, Spatial Planning and Land Use, Marine and Fisheries, 
Agriculture, and Forests and Forestry61, provide an overview of key issues in adapting to the consequences 
of climate change for the natural environment in Scotland. The actions outlined provide an indication 
of the broad range of work planned over the coming years to strengthen resilience to the impacts of 
climate change.

The ‘Scottish Biodiversity Strategy’ has identified some actions to assist in adaptation to climate change, 
and more will be described as understanding of climate change risks and impacts increases. Many 
actions to assist in adaptation have been identified in the Scottish Natural Heritage publication Climate 
change and natural heritage – SNH’s approach and action plan. 

The Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 places responsibilities on Scottish Ministers and public authorities 
regarding the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change including the need to set mitigation and 
adaptation objectives in a national or regional marine plan. 

‘Getting the best from our land: a land use strategy for Scotland’ recognises that land-use decisions 
should be informed by the opportunities and threats from climate change. Implementation of the 
Strategy will draw on the outputs from the CCRA.

adaptation objectives in a national or regional marine plan. 

‘Getting the best from our land: a land use strategy for Scotland’ recognises that land-use decisions 
should be informed by the opportunities and threats from climate change. Implementation of the 
Strategy will draw on the outputs from the CCRA.

Wales

Through the Natural Environment Framework (NEF)62, Wales is developing an ecosystems approach to 
managing the natural environment. Its guiding principle is to ensure that Wales has increasingly resilient 
and diverse ecosystems that are managed to deliver economic, social and environmental benefits. 
Climate change mitigation and adaptation are important elements in this new approach.

Northern Ireland

In Northern Ireland, the river basin management plans, published in 2009, take into account the 
potential impacts of climate change and set out measures to address the implications for on the 
water environment. Within the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme 2007-201363, the 
Countryside Management Scheme aims to maintain and enhance biodiversity on farmland whilst also 
taking account of climate change. Climate change impacts will be considered as part of the review of 
the Northern Ireland Biodiversity Strategy. A recent consultation on the Alien Invasive Species Strategy 
sets out a co-ordinated policy and management framework to minimise the risk of invasive species to 
the economy, environment and society.

First, we need to consider the issues highlighted in the UK CCRA Evidence Report and work with others 
in the UK to develop a consensus on the analysis. This is part of the process of developing the National 
Adaptation Programme. We know that there are uncertainties on the scale and impacts of climate 
change, but we cannot use this as an excuse for inaction: the potential consequences of the risks are 
too great to be ignored. 

Second, the Climate Change Act 2008 requires the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment to be reviewed 
and updated every five years. A key strength of this first CCRA is its ability to consider the relative 
urgency around disparate risks, whilst highlighting where more work needs to be done to improve our 
understanding. In advance of the development of the next CCRA we will be developing our evidence 
base through a programme of research and close collaborative working with sectors that have been 
identified for priority action.

Third, looking forward to the National Adaptation Programme, the UK Government will work with the 
Devolved Governments and Local Government, to ensure that the UK is prepared to manage the risks 
(and take advantage of the opportunities) presented by a changing climate. It is particularly important 
for us to develop the NAP with a wide range of organisations and businesses, because:

•  Adaptation is context-specific – effective adaptation depends on who is adapting, where they are, 
their attitude to risk, and how they weigh up other factors in their decisions. The costs and benefits 
of options vary by location and by the decision-maker, unlike reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
which have wider benefits regardless of where the reductions take place;

•  Adaptation has no prescribed target and is not a one-off but an on-going process – there is no single 
metric, like tonnes of carbon emitted, against which to assess decisions; 

•  Uncertainty about the scale, timing and spatial nature of how the climate might change puts greater 
weight on flexibility and keeping options open. The benefits of flexibility are harder to evaluate 
against other, less flexible options that might provide more certain, short-term benefits. But it is 
important that early action does not lock us into what may become inappropriate adaptation in the 
future and active monitoring and reviewing progress will be required.

4.1. What is the UK Government’s Approach to Developing the National Adaptation 
Programme?
The Climate Change Act 2008 places a requirement on the Secretary of State to lay a programme of 
actions before Parliament addressing the risks identified in the CCRA. This should be done ‘as soon as 
reasonably practicable’ after the CCRA. In practice, this means during 2013. 

This will be the first NAP covering a period of five years (2013-2018). The NAP will be reviewed and a 
new Programme developed on a five-yearly cycle, following each new CCRA. 

The first NAP will be based around the five themes identified in the CCRA. In recognition of the fact that 
many policy areas relevant to adaptation are devolved to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – where 
each Government has its own adaptation programme – the NAP will focus on England and reserved, 
excepted, and non-devolved matters where necessary (for example responsibility for aspects of energy 
policy and aviation policy lies with the UK Government), in collaboration with Devolved Governments.

The UK economy relies heavily on imports and exports and, therefore, there is high dependency on 
activities overseas, such as transport and communication and the integrity of supply chains. The World 
Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report64 considered climate change as the most important environmental 
risk and, more importantly, showed how it is inter-related with global food and water security, macro-
economic and geopolitical risks. The recent Foresight study on the International Dimensions of Climate 
Change provides an overview of the international climate change risks and how these may affect 
the UK, and the Met Office Report, ‘Climate: Observations, Projections and Impacts’ provides, at a 
high level, the scale of potential climate threats and opportunities across a number of countries in 
different regions.

A considerable amount of further work needs to be done on international risks, and the NAP will take 
the global impacts of climate change into account.

4.2. Content of the National Adaptation Programme
The CCRA identifies a number of risks where decisions are considered ‘urgent’ i.e. decisions have to be 
taken by the 2020s. It is therefore the UK Government’s intention that, given the 5-year cyclical nature 
of the adaptation process, these urgent areas will provide the focus for the first National Adaptation 
Programme.65

The UK Government’s intention is that the Programme will articulate well developed policy proposals, 
but also signal areas for future development and consideration. The CCRA has identified a number 
of key evidence gaps and we will work with Research Councils to develop a programme of work to 
address the most significant issues. 

Although Government will work with partners to set the national framework for adaptation, our 
response to a changing climate will require action across society – in organisations across sectors, as 
well as at the more local level, for example by local government, businesses and civil society. 

Working with stakeholders it is therefore the UK Government’s intention to work with others in a 
collaborative approach to policy making – to co-create with relevant organisations, and seek to achieve 
a high degree of consensus on this programme. Beginning this process, alongside the publication of the 
CCRA, the UK Government is publishing a ‘call for views’ seeking stakeholders’ input on areas where 
urgent action is required.

64 World Economic Forum. 2011. Global Risks 2011. 6th edition. http://riskreport.weforum.org/
65  As highlighted in the Assessment, a number of the risks examined are potentially very significant but our current level of knowledge means that there 

are also large uncertainties. This is particularly the case for complex systems such as ecosystems and business networks. Future research will improve 
the evidence base but it is likely that early action will be needed to deal with both current risks and future risks.

4.3. Next Steps by Devolved Governments
The type, magnitude and urgency of climate change risks vary across the UK. As much policy relevant 
to adaptation is devolved, the Devolved Governments are developing their own adaptation strategies.

Scottish Government

The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 puts in place parallel arrangements to those set out in the 
UK Climate Change Act. Specifically, the Scottish Act requires a Scottish Adaptation Programme to be 
developed to address the risks identified in the CCRA for Scotland.

This will be the first Scottish Adaptation Programme covering a period of five years (2013-2018) and a 
new Programme will be developed every five years, following each new CCRA. 

Scotland’s Climate Change Adaptation Framework and the accompanying 12 Sector Action Plans66 are 
a non-statutory forerunner to the Scottish Adaptation Programme. 

Welsh Government

The Climate Change Strategy for Wales, published in 2010, sets out the Welsh Government’s approach 
for managing the impacts of climate change. The Adaptation Framework confirmed in the Strategy 
presents a national, co-ordinated approach to ensure that Wales is well-placed to adapt to a changing 
climate in a sustainable way. It has three objectives: 

• to build the evidence base; 

• to embed preparing for a changing climate into decision-making; 

• to share information and good practice. 

The Adaptation Delivery Plan sits alongside the Climate Change Strategy for Wales and sets out the 
specific measures being implemented to deliver the Adaptation Framework.

The CCRA provides Wales with an analysis of the key risks and opportunities that climate change 
presents for Wales, and paves the way for prioritised discussion and action in such areas as infrastructure 
planning, health planning, eco-system management, economic renewal and community resilience.

Under the Climate Change Act 2008, Welsh Ministers have a duty to report on their objectives, action 
and priorities in relation to greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of climate change in Wales. The 
Welsh Government will consider the findings of the CCRA in the first progress report on its Climate 
Change Strategy, scheduled for March 2012, to fulfil Welsh Ministers’ obligations under the Act.

The CCRA will also be used to inform revisions of the Adaptation Delivery Plan, and in developing 
Sectoral Adaptation Plans for the Natural Environment, Infrastructure, Business and Tourism, 
Communities, and Health.

Northern Ireland Executive

The Northern Ireland Executive is responsible for adaptation to climate change in all transferred policy 
areas under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and has given a commitment in its Sustainable Development 
Implementation Plan to produce a cross-Departmental Climate Change Adaptation Programme.

The UK Climate Change Act 2008 requires Northern Ireland Departments to prepare an adaptation 
programme to address the climate change risks to Northern Ireland and to review them no later than 
every five years. Reports on the adaptation programme and subsequent progress are required to be 
made to the Northern Ireland Assembly. 

A Cross-Departmental Working Group on Climate Change (CDWG CC) has been established by the 
Northern Ireland Executive to support work on climate change. An Adaptation Sub Group has also been 
convened with responsibility to:

•  Support the preparation of an assessment of the risks to the United Kingdom of the current and 
predicted impact of climate change;

•  Support the preparation of an adaptation economic assessment on the key climate change risks to 
the United Kingdom;

•  Evaluate the climate change risks and opportunities for Northern Ireland and prepare and deliver a 
cross-departmental adaptation programme on climate change; 

•  Review cross-departmental action on adaptation on an annual basis and report to the CDWG CC on 
progress; and

• Make recommendations and/or decisions on wider climate change adaptation issues as appropriate.

4.4. Conclusions
The CCRA analysis commissioned by, and delivered to, the UK Government marks a significant step 
forward in developing our understanding of the potential future impacts of a changing climate – and it 
also increases understanding of vulnerability to our current weather. 

The CCRA will form the core of the evidence base when considering what the national response should 
be to the projected changes in our climate. We should be in no doubt that whilst these changes are 
uncertain, many are also potentially significant. Many are irreversible and cannot be ignored. The CCRA 
is not the last word on analysing climate risk – it is the start of a process. 

In many areas Government and other expert organisations will need to consider specific issues and risks, 
and undertake additional analysis if necessary, before decisions can be made. In other areas, it may be 
that Government and others are already considering projected climate change in policies and decisions. 
In some areas of less pressing risks, however, the appropriate response may be to wait, and consider any 
action only once the underlying climate changes are more certain or their potential impacts more clear.

This risk-based approach, and planning properly for the long term for a range of futures, is a big 
challenge. Tackling that challenge successfully will allow us to protect and enhance our economy, 
society and environment both now and for future generations.
